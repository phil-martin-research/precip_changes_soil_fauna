AB  - The global land area devoted to rubber plantations has now reached 13 million hectares, and the further expansion of these rubber plantations at the expense of tropical forests will have significant adverse effects on the ecological environment. Rubber-based agroforestry systems are considered a preferable approach for ameliorating the ecological environment. Many researchers have focused on the positive effects of rubber-based agroforestry systems on the ecological environment, while ignoring the risks involved in the establishment of rubber-based agroforestry systems. The present study investigated the effects of different-aged rubber-based agroforestry systems on the abundance and diversity of ground arthropods. It has been observed that the abundance and taxon richness of ground arthropods generally showed no difference when comparing young and mature rubber plantations. The rubber-based agroforestry systems significantly decreased the understory vegetation species, along with the abundance and taxon richness of ground arthropods compared to the same agedrubber monoculture plantations. In addition, the change in the abundance and taxon richness of ground arthropods was greatly affected by the understory vegetation species and soil temperature. The abundance and taxon richness of ground arthropods decreased with the decrease in number of species of understory vegetation. The study results indicate that the establishment of rubber-based agroforestry systems have adversely affected the abundance and richness of ground arthropods to an extant greater than expected. Therefore, single, large rubber-based agroforestry systems are not recommended, and the intercropping of rubber and rubber-based agroforestry systems must be designed to promote the migration of ground arthropods between different systems.

AB  - Changes in temperature and rainfall linked to recent climate change increase the mortality rates of European temperate tree species. The economic importance of trees and the ecosystem services they provide differ according to their social status (dominant or suppressed trees) and their size. The extent to which climate change impacts these different categories in different ways remains little explored. Ecophysiological differences between tree size and status suggest different sensitivities to climate change. Dominant trees are exposed to more evapotranspiration than suppressed trees that benefit from buffered climatic conditions. Large trees are able to develop a network of fine roots that allow deeper water and nutrient uptake during water shortage periods, but that have higher water requirements and more physical constraints than small trees due to the fact that they must lift water to greater heights. We used 207,100 trees from the French forest inventory data (including 3,514 dead trees), representing eight common European tree species. For each species, we separated the tree population into three subsets of suppressed, small dominant and large dominant trees. For each subset, we modelled the mortality observed in a stand in the absence of disturbances (background mortality), with a focus on the differences in sensitivity to recent changes in temperature and rainfall. After having taken the main mortality drivers related to competition into account, as well as stand characteristics including logging intensity effect, we assessed the over-mortality linked to the recent changes in temperature and rainfall for each of the three subsets. When considering both changes in temperature and rainfall, the climate change related to over-mortality was greater for suppressed than for small or large dominant trees, for all the species. Over-mortality of suppressed trees was related to temperature increase, whereas a maximum vulnerability related to rainfall decrease was observed for large dominant trees. Over-mortality driven by climate change not only concerns large and dominant trees, but small and especially suppressed ones as well. These results suggest that in addition to wood production, forest renewal and ecosystem services associated with understorey vegetation are threatened by the recent changes in temperature and rainfall in European temperate forests.

AB  - No-till sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) systems is considered as an interesting option to reduce the cost of production and allow the conservation of both soil quality and biological activity. This study was conducted at a sugarcane mill in Goiatuba, in the state of Goi?as, Brazil, which grows sugarcane variety SP 813250. An experiment based on a factorial design (2 ? 2 ? 2) was set up to compare the diversity of soil arthropods in sugarcane grown under no till and conventional tillage systems, the efficiency of two methods used to extract soil arthropods (BerleseTullgren funnel and flotation in saturated salt solution), and the effects of sampling time (morning or afternoon) at different times of the year (September 2015, November 2015, April 2016, and June 2016). A total of 2776 arthropods belonging to 11 taxa were collected. Acari, Hymenoptera, and Isoptera were the most abundant arthropods (89.3%). The tillage system and sampling time did not affect soil arthropod diversity. The BerleseTullgren funnel method was more efficient at extracting arthropods in the rainy season (September and November), whereas the saturated salt solution method was more efficient in the dry season (April and June). The highest soil arthropod abundance was recorded in the rainy season. Our results suggest that the soil disturbance caused by tilling has no effect on soil arthropod diversity in sugarcane plantations.

AB  - Development of endophytic corn-seeds is a method of maintaining a high yield since the seed escapes from pest and disease infestation. Mr14 varieties and Nei9008 varieties have advantages such as resistant to downy mildew (Peronosclerospora maydis L), leaf rust disease (P. sorgi), leaf blight (Helminthosporium maydis), have high yield potential, drought tolerant, root and stem resistance and are recommended planting in the dry season in paddy fields or dry land. Arthropods are one of the pests that often attack corn plants. This study aims to determine the type of arthropods found in endophytic plants.The results showed that in endophytic hybrid corn area (Variety Mr14 x Variety Nei9008) found 28 types of arthropods. Arthropods that are most commonly found on land are black beetles (Coleoptera order) of 194 tails. From arthropods found in corn plantations, there are several Arthropods that act as pests, as predators, and as parasitoids. Diversity index is moderate.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Liparis loeselii (L.) Rich. (Fen Orchid) that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history and conservation. Liparis loeselii is a small terrestrial orchid that has a circumboreal distribution and is widespread in Europe and North America. Despite its wide distribution, the species is locally rare and has declined considerably in most of its range. In Britain, the species has a disjunct distribution and is now known to occur consistently at only six sites in eastern England and three in south Wales. It is absent from Ireland. Its most characteristic habitats in Britain are inland fens and coastal dune slacks, but outside Britain it can also be found in wet meadows, marshes, forested seep springs, at lake borders or on mats of floating peat. Populations of Liparis loeselii in dune slacks tend to be short-lived, and can rapidly increase in size or decrease and disappear as environmental conditions change. The species does not tolerate high nutrient concentrations or low pH. It is susceptible to drought, which reduces seed germination, seedling recruitment and adult survival. Heavy predation by rabbits and rodents has been observed under drought conditions. Liparis loeselii reproduces both by sexual reproduction, and by vegetative propagation through the production of pseudobulbs. Although flowers are accessible to insects, entomophilous pollination is unusual, and most sexual reproduction is the result of selfing. Fruits ripen late in the growing season (mid-October) and the dust-like seeds are dispersed during winter by wind and water. Germination occurs during the following growing season and is supported by a wide variety of mycorrhizal fungi. Since the late 19th century Liparis loeselii has declined considerably in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, primarily due to habitat destruction and loss, natural succession, and habitat desiccation due to drainage. As a result, the species has been listed as endangered in the Bern Convention and the European Habitat Directive (92/43/EEC) and is the focus of intensive conservation efforts in many countries. Restoration of habitat by mowing, extensive grazing and peat removal, and the creation of new habitat by dune slack formation in dune systems and peat removal in fens may prolong population persistence and promote establishment of new populations.

AB  - Orangutans (Pongo spp.) populations used to be widely distributed throughout Southeast Asia, from Java in the south to the Southern China in the north during the Pleistocene. Their populations have declined up to 75% of their original size and are now distributed only in parts of the tropical rainforests of Borneo and Sumatra. Pongo pygmaeus, Pongo tapanuliensis and Pongo abelli are the three most representative species, in this study, here we discussed the latter. Sumatran forests are generally suffering from deforestation with rates ranging from 3.74% to 49.85% between 2000 and 2012. Thus, human wildlife conflict intensity has escalated and gained more traction. Orangutans are known as arboreal great apes and need to build nests for resting. We applied the transect line method (three transects; each 1,000 m long) at different elevations in Soraya Research Station, Gelombang Village, Sultan Daulat sub-district, Subulussalam district, and assessed the nest characteristics. The characteristics are: (1) nesting position referring to the position of nest on a tree; (2) nest successional stages defining the age and leaf decay used in constructing a nest indicated with I (new) until V (almost gone); and (3) nest density to predict the density of nest per square km. Afterwards, the identified nesting trees along the transect were further identified based on their species, and assessed based on three characteristics (the tree height, diameter and the height of a nest measured from the soil). A total of 27 nests were found, and 44% were located in transect III or at the riparian. Out of 27, four orangutans' nests were found on Moraceae (Streblus elongatus) and Myrtaceae (Syzigium spp.), while three nests were found on Dipterocarpus sp. The tree height, tree diameter and nest height were 10 m-25 m (mean = 17.5 m; SD = +/- 0.25), 10 cm-30 cm (mean = 20 cm; SD = +/- 0.4) and 16 m-20 m (mean = 18 m; SD = +/- 0.35), respectively. Meanwhile, nest density calculated based on the form: d = [NI (L* 2w)], and the values obtained were 8.4, 13.45, 26.9 nests/km(2) located on transect I, II and III or at the riparian. The most commonly found nest successional stages and position were stage III and position 3, respectively. This study could serve as a baseline research in primate conservation and nest characterisation could be used as guidance for any future activity planning (e.g. tree reforestation) in a particular region and the existence of various tree species diversity are indispensable for maintaining orangutan habitats' quality.

AB  - The Cerrado-Amazon transition (CAT) is located between the two largest biogeographic domains of the Neotropical region, coinciding with the "Arc of Deforestation", an agricultural frontier that expands towards the Amazon. Fire plays an important role in the landscape changes that have been occurring in this transition. Thus, the objectives of this study were (i) evaluate the accuracy of different algorithms/techniques in predicting fires in the CAT; (ii) investigate the season of highest fire probabilities in the CAT; and (iii) identify, among anthropic, climatic, topographic and soil variables, the main drivers of fires spatial distribution in the CAT. Fire occurrence data (active fire pixels) from the MODIS sensor were used as input data in species distribution models. The SDM allowed the construction of monthly fire probability models for the study area. The model's quality was assessed by R-squared, RMSE, AUC and TSS metrics. In addition, we assessed the weight of variables in building the models. To obtain the fire seasonality, we used the bootstrap technique to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) about the mean. As result, we found that all algorithms obtained satisfactory performance, as well as the ensemble model technique used, which obtained an average AUC of 0.812 +/- 0.001. The algorithm with the best individual performance was Random Forest, with a mean AUC 0.851 +/- 0.002. Similar patterns were found when considering TSS metrics. The predicted and observed fire occurrences showed strong association (R-2 = 0.81). The high fire probability area was higher during the dry season (15304.37 +/- 41.65), showing a significant difference (p-value <= 0.05) from the rainy season. The variables that most explained the fire occurrences along the CAT were 'Silt Fraction', 'Distance from Agriculture' and 'Maximum Temperature'. In addition, 'Distance from Roads', 'Distance from Protected Areas' and Elevation' were relevant for the monthly models. Anthropogenic variables were more important during the dry season. The results demonstrate that SDMs can be adequately used in fire prediction. Protected areas have shown an important role in acting as a fire barrier. However, many of these areas are vulnerable, surrounded by high fire probabilities during the dry season, predominantly anthropic, putting the natural dynamics of fire in the region and the local biodiversity at risk. Our approach can be useful in environmental protection and monitoring, in addition to facilitating the understanding about the CAT ecological complexity and the high anthropogenic pressure happening there.

AB  - Fertilization will cause changes in crop growth, soil microbial community and multiple ecosystem functions, but it is unclear whether and how the optimal productivity obtained by manure application and optimizing nitrogen is driven by microbial community and ecosystem multifunctionality. We explore this mechanism based on a field fertilization experiment using a split-plot design that began in 2014 with five N rates (N0, N75, N150, N225, N300) as main plots and two manure rates (M0, NPK group; M1, MNPK group) as subplots, respectively. In general, (1) grain yield was parabolically related to the N application rate. The N rates that obtained the highest yield were 150 kg ha-1 and 225 kg ha-1 for the MNPK and NPK groups, respectively. The average yield of the MNPK group was 10.5% higher than that of the NPK group. (2) Long-term fertilization management resulted in regular changes in soil multifunctionality (SMF) and the properties of various microbial communities. The richness, network complexity and soil multifunctionality of bacterial and fungal communities also increased initially and then decreased as the N rate. On average, the response ratio of soil multifunctionality to N75, N150, N225, N300 (control is N0) and M1 (control is M0) were 0.11, 0.41, 0.53, 0.44 and 1.19, respectively. The soil multifunctionality of MNPK was 260%, 722% and 101% higher than that of NPK at the tillering, jointing and harvest stages, respectively. (3) Soil multifunctionality not only always had a significant positive effect on aboveground biomass at all growth stages, but also had significant positive correlations with bacterial richness and network complexity. Based on the existing framework, we further demonstrated that high microbial richness supports multifunctionality by ensuring strong associative complexity among microorganisms. However, only bacterial network complexity always positively drove soil multifunctionality and indirectly influenced wheat growth at all growth stages in SEMs where multiple drivers were considered simultaneously (i.e., pH, SOC and biological factors). Random forest regression analysis showed that rare bacterial taxa had stronger predictive effects on soil multifunctionality than abundant taxa. Our results validate that M1N150 can ensure high yield in the study area while maintaining a high level of ecosystem function in the soil, which also contributes to the reduction of adverse environmental risks caused by fertilizer application. Importantly, the potential of microbial network complexity, especially bacterial network complexity, to influence crop growth by driving farmland ecosystem functions deserves to be explored under different crop types, cropping systems, and irrigation conditions, compared to previous microbial richness that has been simply quantified.

AB  - Climate and land-use changes have driven the dominance of native herbaceous plants in degraded tropical forests, leading to losses in biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, controlling these super-dominant species to promote forest regeneration is often ineffective and may favour undesirable species. Native clonal ferns from the Pteridium genus often dominate degraded tropical forests subjected to repeated fires. Although many ways of controlling these species have been proposed, the efficiency of different combinations of strategies and their effect on forest recovery remain unknown. Here, we assessed to what extent removing the aboveground biomass of the shade-intolerant Pteridium arachnoideum and planting trees contributed to the control of this fern and the recovery of montane Atlantic forests in south-east Brazil. In four sites dominated by P. arachnoideum we applied five treatments in adjacent plots: (1) control without interference, (2) cutting twice per year, (3) cutting twice per year plus tree planting, (4) cutting three times per year, and (5) cutting three times per year plus tree planting. Over two consecutive years we repeated the treatments and monitored P. arachnoideum height, rhizome and above-ground biomass, as well as the composition of the established vegetation and soil seed bank. We also assessed the survival and growth of the planted trees. Tree planting accounted for over half of the treatment costs, whereas increasing the cutting frequency only increased costs by 15 %. After two years, the three times per year cutting treatment caused the largest decrease in above-ground biomass (1 to 0.1 kg/m2) and abundance (80 to 15 %) of P. arachnoideum. Planted trees exhibited low survival (47 %) rates and growth (30 cm/year), and hence had no effect on the dominance of P. arachnoideum. Treatments did not affect rhizome biomass, suggesting that P. arachnoideum could regain its dominance if cutting treatments were discontinued. Although two annual cuts slightly favoured tree regeneration, trees were rare in both the established vegetation (less than 10 %) and seed bank (less than 0.3 seeds/dm3). Conversely, under three annual cuts the African grass M. minutiflora became more abundant in both the established vegetation (5 to 25 %) and seed bank (1 to 4 seeds/dm3). Our findings show that intensive mechanical removal decreases the dominance of P. arachnoideum in Atlantic forests. However, its benefits to forest recovery seem to be limited by lack of tree regeneration, impoverished seed banks and invasive grasses. Therefore, planting fast-growing and drought-tolerant tree species may be essential to the recovery of these degraded Neotropical forests.

AB  - Coastal wetlands, which are fragile and intricate ecosystems with continuously changing salinity and moisture, are especially sensitive to climate changes and anthropogenic activities. As a typical coastal wetland in North China, the Chenier Island of the Yellow River Delta served as the study area to demonstrate the composition, seasonal variations, and salinization characteristics of soil salinity in different seasons. A total of 144 soil samples from 0 cm to 60 cm depth in the coastal zone were comprehensively studied during pre-, among and post-monsoon seasons of 2015. Soil salt contents, anions and cations in the beach, seaward side, dune crest, and landside were quantitatively analyzed through field sampling and experimental determination, and the ion composition, seasonal dynamics, and salinization characteristics of soil salinity in different microtopography types were explored. Physicochemical data revealed that soil salinity changed with the seasons and ranged from 0.76 g.kg(-1) to 13.57 g.kg(-1) during the sampling period. Soil salinity exhibited distinct spatial heterogeneity and was high in landside and low in dune crest and seaward side along the Chenier Island of the Yellow River Delta. Considering the soil texture, the soil salinity of coastal saline soils was higher than that of shell sandy soils. Salt migration demonstrated seasonality, and soil salinity presented a downward trend in the rainy season, thereby showing a bottom accumulation pattern. Soil salinity tended to move upwards with capillary action in the absence of rain interference in the dry season, which reveals a surface accumulation pattern. The relationship among soil salt content and Na+, Mg2+, Cl-, and SO42- showed an extremely significant positive correlation at the 0.01 level, and that relationship between soil salt content and K+ showed a significant positive correlation at the 0.05 level. However, the correlation with Ca2+ was insignificant at the 0.05 level. Despite the high content of Ca2+, the ions of Na+, Cl-, and SO42- dominated salinity. Additionally, the present study indicated that soil salinity demonstrated seasonality in the order of spring > autumn > summer, and summer was selected as the optimal desalination time. The salinization situation among different microtopographies exhibited some differences, the soil was seriously salinized in the landside and beach, but only nonsalinization or mild salinization was found in the seaward side and dune crest. Furthermore, shell sand in the Chenier Island of the Yellow River Delta could provide a favorable soil habitat for plant settlement and create advantageous conditions for the increase in biodiversity, which would provide a scientific basis for soil management and ecological restoration.

AB  - True mangroves are vascular plants (Tracheophyta) that evolved into inhabiting the mid and upper intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical soft-sediment coasts around the world. While several dozens of species are known from the Indo-West Pacific region, the Atlantic-East Pacific region is home to only a mere dozen of true mangrove species, most of which are rare. Mangrove trees can form dense monospecific or multispecies stands that provide numerous ecosystem services. Despite their eminent socioecological and socioeconomic relevance and the plethora of studies on mangroves, many details of the ecology of mangrove ecosystems remain unknown; and our knowledge about general ecological principles in mangrove ecosystems is scarce. For instance, the functional trait concept has hardly been applied to mangroves. Here we provide an inventory of 28 quantitative and 8 qualitative functional traits of true mangrove species and stipulate some insight into how these traits may drive ecosystem structure and processes. The differentiation between true mangroves and mangrove associates, which can dwell inside as well as outside mangrove forests, is reflected by a number of leaf traits. Thus, true mangroves exhibit lower specific leaf area, lower leaf N content, and lower K:Na ratio, and higher leaf succulence, higher Na and Cl content, and higher osmolality than mangrove associates. True mangrove species that form pure stands produce larger leaves and exhibit higher N content per leaf area, higher leaf K and Ca content, greater maximum plant height, longer propagules, and lower root porosity than more sporadic species. The species-specific expression of most traits does not reflect the species' position along intertidal gradients, suggesting that adaptation to tidal inundation does not explain these traits. Rather, many of the traits studied herein exhibit strong phylogenetic signals in true mangroves. Thus, wood density is high in most species of the Rhizophoraceae, irrespective of their habitat or maximum height. On the other hand, species of the genus Sonneratia exhibit low wood density and do not grow taller than 20 m. Some leaf traits of true mangroves are more like those of plants from drier environments, reflecting the perception that a saline environment creates physiological drought stress. Along the same line, most true mangrove species exhibit sclerophyllous leaf traits. The few major mangrove tree species of the Atlantic-East Pacific are as distinct from each other, with regard to some traits, as are the many mangrove species of the Indo-West Pacific. We hypothesize that this phenomenon explains the similarly high biomass of mangrove forests in both the species-rich IndoWest Pacific and the species-poor Atlantic-East Pacific.

AB  - Soil wind erosion is a global problem that leads to increasingly serious regional land degradation, where the need for windbreak and sand fixation services (WSFS) is substantial. Inner Mongolia plays an important role in global semiarid and arid areas and the severe land degradation resulting from soil wind erosion warrants an urgent solution. However, the mechanism of influence of various driving factors on windbreak and sand fixation services is still not fully studied. In this paper, the revised wind erosion equation (RWEQ) model was used to synthesize the monthly spatiotemporal dynamics of soil wind erosion modulus (SWEM) and WSFS in Inner Mongolia from January 2000 to February 2020 from a semi-monthly scale. The influencing factors of WSFS were examined from both natural and anthropogenic aspects. Results show that over the past 20 years, the average SWEM in Inner Mongolia was 118.06 t ha(-1) yr(-1), the areas with severe wind erosion were mainly concentrated in the desert areas in the southwest of Inner Mongolia, and the forests in the northeast suffered less soil wind erosion. Meanwhile, the average WSFS was 181.11 x 10(8) t yr(-1), with the high-value areas mainly located in major deserts, sandy land, and the area bordering Mongolia in the north and the low-value areas mainly located in the densely forested northeast and the Gobi Desert in the northwest. Both SWEM and WSFS showed a clear downward trend and a certain periodicity over the past 20 years. WSFS showed two peaks a year (April and October). Among the natural factors, precipitation and NDVI showed a significant correlation with WSFS and were identified as the main driving factors of WSFS, whereas temperature had no significant correlation. Among the anthropogenic factors, farming and animal husbandry intensity and GDP showed a positive correlation with WSFS, whereas population showed a negative correlation. These four types of factors were identified as socio-economic factors that drive WSFS. Meanwhile, WSFS did not show any significant correlation with the administrative area. Land use change contributed to a large proportion of WSFS change, thereby suggesting that the intensity of human activities is another central driver of WSFS.

AB  - The formation of tufa barriers is driven by specific physicochemical and biological factors which make them very sensitive to environmental changes. The barriers provide great microhabitat complexity and are therefore inhabited by various periphytic organisms, whose metabolic activity alters the microenvironment, directly or indirectly affecting the physicochemical conditions of calcite precipitation. After the invasive plant species Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swinge was identified as one of the main factors causing current dryness of streams at the Skradinski buk barrier (Krka National Park, Croatia), the invasive species was removed, resulting in changes in the hydromorphology of the barrier and reactivating previously dry streams. The objective of this study was to determine potential differences between control and revitalized sites (reactivated streams) with regards to periphyton and the associated environmental changes over an annual cycle. Clear patterns were observed between sites reflecting the substantial changes in the landscape following invasive species removal. Revitalized sites had lower flow velocity, conductivity, pH, alkalinity and total water hardness values while exhibiting higher values of dissolved organic matter, nitrites and orthophosphates due to the presence of soil-derived organic material and intensive soil drainage. Organic matter content was generally higher at revitalized sites but did not inhibit tufa deposition. The influence of the surrounding forest soil was reflected not only in the mineralogical analysis of tufa sediment, but also in the abundance and diversity of periphyton. Revitalized site communities exhibited higher abundance and diversity and were dominated by bacterivorous and omnivorous ciliates and cercozoans due to the abundant food resources of the soil. The results presented show that ecosystem responses to hydromorphological changes generated by invasive species removal can be efficiently detected and monitored at microscale (i.e., periphyton scale) through a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach. As the first study to examine the relationship between aquatic ecosystems and sediments in the context of tufa stream revitalization, this pilot study provides data and guidelines for future management plans applicable to various tufa depositing systems facing invasive species propagation, allowing better understanding and protection of this unique and vulnerable karstic feature.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6].
   First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.
   5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature.
   The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19]. Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.
   On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare. As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.

More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health.

However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8].

Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15].

Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities.

Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.

The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10].

Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture.

   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.

The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1].

Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16]. Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2].

Additionally, economic damages from climate change have already been recorded in industries such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, and tourism, which may further drive the displacement of communities, as they lose access to traditional livelihoods and culture [16].Although the specific impacts of climate change will vary regionally, the common theme of the effects of climate change on human health and well being is that existing inequalities will be made worse. Disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, indigenous communities, and local communities dependent on agricultural or coastal livelihoods are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing adverse effects with a 1.5 degrees C increase in temperature. The Global Climate Risk Index shows that many lower income countries are at the highest risk of extreme weather events [19].
   Already, data show that between 1961 and 2000, climate change harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting economies of wealthier nations, increasing the global wealth gap by 25% [20].To limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2030, most models suggest that, by 2030, global CO2 emissions must decline by 45% from 2010 levels and then must approach net-zero emissions by 2050 [6]. Solar energy, wind energy, electrification of urban systems, urban green infrastructure, energy efficiency demand-side management, improved forest and grassland management, and reduced food waste and loss are all existing, technically viable, and cost-effective methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions [21-25].However, achieving the 1.5 degrees C target requires more than these mitigation efforts alone. Rapid transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure, and industrial systems are essential. Additionally, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) on a substantial scale ranging from 100 to 1000 GTCO2 (gigatons of carbon dioxide) will be necessary [26]. Existing CDR methods include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization [8].Despite the existing methods for reducing GHGs and for CDR, the nationally determined contributions to greenhouse gas emissions that have been announced as of October 2021 make it more likely than not that warming will exceed 1.5 degrees C during the 21st century and will make it harder to limit warming below 2 degrees C [8]. If this were the case, greater CDR utilization would be required to sustain net negative carbon emissions and lower global mean surface temperature.Technological solutions are an essential but insufficient component of the response to climate change. Any efforts to address climate change must consider existing social and economic inequities and the potential for worsening these inequities. Technological solutions that seek to address the impacts of climate change should be assessed and implemented within a sustainable development framework, which the United Nations defines as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" [27]. The feasibility of the United Nations sustainable development model is predicated on the idea that developed countries who have signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change should mobilize funds to address the climate mitigation and adaptation needs of countries that are still developing. This obligation arises from the fact that approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from China, the United States, the EU, India, Russia, and Japan, while most of the countries who are experiencing the worst effects of climate change have comparatively negligible greenhouse gas emissions [28].Ultimately, addressing climate change in a sustainable and equitable way will require a multifaceted approach that considers local sociopolitical contexts, resources, and needs. The response to climate change thus far has been insufficient and the chances for keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees C continue to grow increasingly slim. In order to limit further warming, fossil fuels must be completely phased out and large-scale changes must be made to agriculture and forestry.On its surface, climate change may not seemingly be connected to healthcare.
   As outlined in this review, however, climate change is already having detrimental effects on human health which will only continue to worsen if warming is left unchecked. The growing field of planetary health seeks to understand and address the impacts of human disruptions to Earth's natural systems on human health and offers a framework for how clinicians can conceptualize the link between climate change and health [29]. As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.Purpose of reviewThis review discusses the urgency of addressing human-caused climate change and its impacts on health and the environment.
   The latest evidence shows that current climate changes are primarily attributable to greenhouse gas emissions from human industrial activity. Exceeding 1.5 degrees C of warming above preindustrial levels is projected to increase extreme weather events, increase rates of heat-related morbidity and mortality and vector-borne disease, exacerbate food and water insecurity, harm biodiversity and agriculture, displace communities, and disproportionately impact disadvantaged groups.Urgent action is required to curb emissions, enact adaptation strategies, and promote climate justice. The healthcare sector must reduce its ecological footprint and prepare systems and workers to address climate change's health effects. Further research should support climate solutions while promoting health equity and environmental justice.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:In the mid-1880 s, scientists initiated the systematic tracking of temperature measurements worldwide, initially through weather stations and ships, and later with the aid of satellites [1]. As this comprehensive collection of data expanded, a discernible pattern emerged: over the past 150 years, the average global temperature has exhibited a persistent upward trend, with the rate of warming progressively intensifying [2]. This wealth of data became the foundation of the burgeoning field of climate science, providing compelling evidence that the planet is undergoing an unparalleled era of rapid warming, primarily attributable to human activities (i.e., anthropogenic influence). The term "global warming" encapsulates this trend of rising global temperatures, although the term "climate change" is now more frequently used, as it also encompasses the multifaceted and diverse impacts resulting from the escalation in global temperatures [3].The mean global surface temperature is estimated to have increased by 1.09 degrees C (1.8 degrees F) during the period from 2010 to 2019 compared to the period from 1850 to 1900 [2]. Moreover, the rate of temperature rise has been notably faster since 1970 than at any point in the past 2000 years [2]. This accelerated warming trend has led to a surge in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, and it has also triggered a cascade of impacts resulting from rising global temperatures. Consequently, our oceans are experiencing warming and increased acidity, ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and precipitation patterns are undergoing significant changes, leading to both more frequent flooding and prolonged droughts [4]. Much of the climate science to date is regularly assessed and consolidated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC was first assembled in 1988 by the United Nations (UN) in order to monitor and assess science related to climate change [5]. Participation is open to all member countries of the UN. The IPCC regularly releases reports generated by scientists who volunteer their time and expertise to review and assess published literature on climate science. These reports provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies. The most recent report was the 6th Synthesis report released in March 2023 [6].The science summarized by the IPCC reports has established several important facts that shape both our understanding of and our response to climate change [6]. First, the current era of climate change is a direct result of human activity [7]. Second, the risks of climate change greatly increase once the globe has warmed more than 1.
   5 C from preindustrial levels, a milestone that is rapidly approaching [8]. Third, significant changes must occur in human activity to reverse warming trends and mitigate risks [8]. no caption availableAlthough the current era of climate change is unprecedented in multiple ways, it is also true that, throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of global temperature shifts that have had large-scale impacts on the Earth's life forms. In the past, these temperature shifts were primarily driven by natural forces in the form of solar energy, ocean circulation, and volcanic activity [9]. However, repeated modeling by scientists has shown that the intense warming that has occurred over the past century cannot be due to these natural drivers alone. In fact, solar output has actually declined since 1880 and volcanic activity has exerted primarily a cooling effect [10]. At most, natural drivers have increased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C, while some estimates suggest that natural drivers have overall decreased the global temperature by 0.1 degrees C since the 1880 s [10].Modeling has shown that the only explanation for the drastic warming of the last century is human activity, primarily via the generation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) [10]. GHGs are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere by absorbing light and preventing it from escaping the Earth. The main GHGs contributing to climate change are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases [2]. In 2019, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were higher than any other time in the last 2 million years and concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide were higher than at any time in the last 800 000 years [2]. The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions is less than 1 in 100 000 [11].The majority of these GHGs come from industrial activities. In 2019, approximately 79% of global GHG emissions came from sectors of energy, industry, transport, and buildings together while 22% came from agriculture, forestry, and other land use [2]. Specifically, carbon dioxide is primarily released via fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes, while methane and nitrous oxide are primarily released from agricultural activities [2].The recent IPCC reports have unambiguously conveyed that when the global mean surface temperature (GMST) reaches 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) above preindustrial temperatures (with a reference period of 1850-1900 approximating preindustrial temperature), the climate-related risks to both human and natural systems greatly increase [6]. Based on these reports, the countries who participated in the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C--2 degrees C by 2030 in order to mitigate the worst effects of climate change [12]. Currently, the GMST is estimated to be 1.08 degrees C above preindustrial levels and is predicted to reach 1.5 degrees C increase between 2030 and 2052 if human GHG emissions remain steady and earlier if GHG emissions continue to grow at their current rates [13].Although future climate-related risks are greater if warming exceeds 1.5 degrees C, the level of risk to human and natural systems is dependent on the degree of warming. The impacts of climate change will be increasingly severe the more that the GMST rises above 1.5 degrees C preindustrial levels [13]. Although the Paris Agreement aims to limit the warming to 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C, there are worst-case scenarios projected by certain models, depicting a potential increase of up to 5 degrees C (9 degrees F) by the year 2100 [14]. Additionally, although we have not yet hit a 1.
   5 degrees C increase, we are already seeing downstream effects related to warming: ice caps are melting, sea levels are rising, and oceans are warming and becoming more acidic [2].The impacts associated with 1.5 degrees C warming are geographically diverse, with varying consequences across the globe. According to the IPCC, a substantial 3.3-3.6 billion people currently reside in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change [15]. Greater frequency of heat waves and droughts in many parts of the globe (particularly the Middle East and South Asia) are predicted to significantly increase the number of annual days where it is too hot for humans to go outside without significant risk to health and life [15]. Other weather-related changes that are predicted to occur in various parts of the globe include increases in aridity and fire weather in some regions and increased rainfall and extreme flooding in others, intensification of tropical cyclones and/or extratropical storms, and threatening of coastal areas by sea level rise [15].Extreme weather events are likely to have a direct impact on human lives and health, including increased morbidity and mortality from heat waves and deaths related to storms and fire weather. Other predicted associations between climate change and human health include an increased spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, increased trauma from extreme weather events, and an increase in mental health conditions and interpersonal violence associated with extreme weather [16].In addition to the direct impacts of extreme weather events on human lives, a 1.5 degrees C warming will likely have downstream influences on human health via its effects on food and water security. Already, climate change has slowed agricultural productivity in many parts of the globe over the last 50 years [17]. Ocean warming and acidification have caused loss of both oceanic and freshwater species and adversely impacted food production from fisheries and shellfish aquaculture. Roughly half of the world's population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this will only increase as temperature warms [18].The IPCC report also predicts the effects of a 1.5 degrees C rise on human livelihoods, homes, and well being. Climate and weather extremes are increasingly driving displacement in almost all parts of the globe, with small island states in the Caribbean and Pacific being disproportionately affected. The number of "climate migrants" will likely continue to rise, as homes and food and water security are threatened [16].

As outlined in the IPCC summary, climate change and its sequelae increase the frequency and range of vector-borne infectious disease, leave people more susceptible to malnutrition and disease via the effects of extreme weather and drought on agriculture and biodiversity, increase the health risks of air pollution from wildfires and/or industrial emissions, and pose direct threats to human lives via extreme weather. Healthcare workers will continue to confront the health effects of climate change among their patients and communities and should be informed about climate change in order to better treat and advocate for their patients. Incorporating concepts of planetary health into medical curriculum will ensure that future physicians are better equipped to address the health implications of climate change. An example of the impact of climate change on kidney health in particular is the impact of a warming planet on fetal development, particularly lower nephron endowment, which increases the risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease later in life [30].In addition to understanding the health implications of climate change, healthcare workers should also be aware of the ways in which the health sector contributes to climate change. The healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 10% of greenhouse gas emissions, with hospitals accounting for a third of emissions [31]. Hospitals use 2.5 times more energy per square foot than an office building and spend more than $6.5 billion on energy each year [31]. Healthcare administrators and employees are in a prime position to advocate for hospitals to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean, renewable energy sources. Not only would this improve downstream effects on patients' health, but it would also result in an estimated $1.2 billion reduction in medical costs [32]. Additionally, hospitals can make significant reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions through reduction of waste, shifting towards sustainable procurement methods, adopting more plant-based foods in hospital cafeterias and investing in sustainable food waste programs, and investment in community resilience against climate change. The Healthcare Climate Council's Climate Action "Playbook for Hospitals" offers tangible steps that many hospital systems have already taken and that others can adopt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [33].Although many of the health effects of climate change are already known, much more research is needed on the ways in which warmer temperatures and extreme weather events will impact health. More research is also needed on the ways in which healthcare workers can best educate and advocate for their patients in the context of climate change. The healthcare sector has a role to play in combating climate change and understanding the fundamentals of climate science is an essential foundation.None.

AB  - Background Mature oak (Quercus spp.) and hickory (Carya spp.) trees are gradually being replaced by more shade-tolerant tree species across the eastern U.S., likely due to fire suppression and increased precipitation. Oaks and hickories are highly valuable to wildlife; therefore, studying their mortality patterns can provide information on the longevity of habitat quality for many animal species. Oak mortality has most often been studied following large oak decline events, but background mortality rates in forests with aging oak and hickory canopies warrant equal attention, especially in the context of widespread oak and hickory regeneration failure. Methods We studied background mortality rates of five oak and one hickory species over a 23-25 year time period (1993-1995 to 2018), using 82 1/20th hectare permanent plots on the Marietta Unit of the Wayne National Forest in southeastern Ohio. We calculated mortality rates based on remeasurement of individual trees for white oak (Quercus alba), chestnut oak (Quercus montana), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), black oak (Quercus velutina), scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), and pignut hickory (Carya glabra). For each of these species other than scarlet oak, we also modeled the relationships of mortality probability with a priori topographic, soil, stand structural, and individual tree covariates, using a mixed-effects logistic regression framework. Results The species with the highest mortality rate was scarlet oak (61.3%), followed by northern red oak (41.4%), black oak (26.7%), pignut hickory (23.9%), white oak (23.4%), and chestnut oak (19.1%). In our models, northern red oak mortality was associated with more mesic slope positions, shallower solums, more acidic soils, and older stand ages. Pignut hickory and chestnut oak mortality rates were associated with higher basal areas on the plot, while white oak mortality showed the opposite pattern. Conclusions Our data suggest that red oak subgenus trees in mature forests of our area will become increasingly uncommon relative to white oak subgenus trees, as the result of higher mortality rates likely related to the shorter lifespans of these species. Particularly vulnerable areas may include more mesic topographic positions, shallower or more acidic soil, and older stands. Since maintaining oak subgenus diversity is beneficial to wildlife diversity in the eastern U.S., managers in areas with extensive mature mixed-oak forests could choose to favor the red oak subgenus when conducting silvicultural treatments.

AB  - Desertification is one of the most critical environmental and socioeconomic issues in the world today. Located in the transitional region between the desert and the Loess Plateau, the Mu Us Sandy Land is one of the nine most environmentally sensitive areas in the world. Remote sensing provides an effective technical method for desertification monitoring. In order to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution of desertification in the Mu Us Sandy Land from 1991 to 2021, the "MSAVI-Albedo" model was employed to extract desertification data in 1991, 2002, 2009 and 2021. The clustering characteristics of desertification were analyzed based on Moran's I statistic. Subsequently, the driving forces in desertification changes were investigated using a geographical detector to analyze the influence of soil, meteorology, and topography on desertification. Additionally, the impact of meteorological and human factors on desertification change in the Mu Us Sandy Land was assessed. From 1991 to 2021, the degree of desertification of the Mu Us Sandy Land showed an overall decreasing trend, and the percentage of land classified as undergoing extremely severe, severe, moderate and mild desertification was improved by 86.11%, 81.82%, 52.5% and 37.42%, respectively. The proportion of land classified as undergoing extremely severe desertification decreased from 29.22% to 5.62%, and the proportion of land undergoing no desertification increased from 4.16% to 18.33%. At the same time, the desertification center shifted westward, and the desertification distribution showed a clustering trend. It is known that different factors affect the formation and distribution of desertification in the Mu Us Sandy Land in the following order: soil, meteorology, and topography. Over the past 30 years, the mean annual temperature and annual precipitation increased at rates of 0.01871 & DEG;C/a and 1.0374 mm/a, respectively, while the mean annual wind speed decreased at a rate of 0.00945 m/s & BULL;a. These changes provided more favorable natural conditions for vegetation growth and sand fixation. Human factors, such as economic development, agriculture and animal husbandry practices, and the policy of returning farmland to forest (grassland) also had a significant impact on the desertification process, leading to a year-by-year improvement in the ecological environment of the Mu Us Sandy Land.

AB  - BackgroundUrbanization greatly affects the natural and social environment of human existence and may have a multifactoral impact on parasitic diseases. Schistosomiasis, a common parasitic disease transmitted by the snail Oncomelania hupensis, is mainly found in areas with population aggregations along rivers and lakes where snails live. Previous studies have suggested that factors related to urbanization may influence the infection risk of schistosomiasis, but this association remains unclear. This study aimed to analyse the effect of urbanization on schistosomiasis infection risk from a spatial and temporal perspective in the endemic areas along the Yangtze River Basin in China.MethodsCounty-level schistosomiasis surveillance data and natural environmental factor data covering the whole Anhui Province were collected. The urbanization level was characterized based on night-time light data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and the National Polar-Orbiting Partnership's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS). The geographically and temporally weighted regression model (GTWR) was used to quantify the influence of urbanization on schistosomiasis infection risk with the other potential risk factors controlled. The regression coefficient of urbanization was tested for significance (alpha = 0.05), and the influence of urbanization on schistosomiasis infection risk was analysed over time and across space based on significant regression coefficients. Variables studied included climate, soil, vegetation, hydrology and topography.ResultsThe mean regression coefficient for urbanization (0.167) is second only to the leached soil area (0.300), which shows that the urbanization is the most important influence factors for schistosomiasis infection risk besides leached soil area. The other important variables are distance to the nearest water source (0.165), mean minimum temperature (0.130), broadleaf forest area (0.105), amount of precipitation (0.073), surface temperature (0.066), soil bulk density (0.037) and grassland area (0.031). The influence of urbanization on schistosomiasis infection risk showed a decreasing trend year by year. During the study period, the significant coefficient of urbanization level increased from - 0.205 to - 0.131.ConclusionsThe influence of urbanization on schistosomiasis infection has spatio-temporal heterogeneous. The urbanization does reduce the risk of schistosomiasis infection to some extend, but the strength of this influence decreases with increasing urbanization. Additionally, the effect of urbanization on schistosomiasis infection risk was greater than previous reported natural environmental factors. This study provides scientific basis for understanding the influence of urbanization on schistosomiasis, and also provides the feasible research methods for other similar studies to answer the issue about the impact of urbanization on disease risk.

AB  - Forest ecosystems in the Mediterranean Basin are mostly situated in the north of the Basin (mesic). In the most southern and dry areas, the forest can only exist where topography and/or altitude favor a sufficient availability of water to sustain forest biomass. We have conducted a thorough review of recent literature (2000-2021) that clearly indicates large direct and indirect impacts of increasing drought conditions on the forests of the Mediterranean Basin, their changes in surface and distribution areas, and the main impacts they have suffered. We have focused on the main trends that emerge from the current literature and have highlighted the main threatens and management solution for the maintenance of these forests. The results clearly indicate large direct and indirect impacts of increasing drought conditions on the forests of the Mediterranean Basin. These increasing drought conditions together with over-exploitation, pest expansion, fire and soil degradation, are synergistically driving to forest regression and dieback in several areas of this Mediterranean Basin. These environmental changes have triggered responses in tree morphology, physiology, growth, reproduction, and mortality. We identified at least seven causes of the changes in the last three decades that have led to the current situation and that can provide clues for projecting the future of these forests: (i) The direct effect of increased aridity due to more frequent and prolonged droughts, which has driven Mediterranean forest communities to the limit of their capacity to respond to drought and escape to wetter sites, (ii) the indirect effects of drought, mainly by the spread of pests and fires, (iii) the direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic activity associated with general environmental degradation, including soil degradation and the impacts of fire, species invasion and pollution, (iv) human pressure and intense management of water resources, (v) agricultural land abandonment in the northern Mediterranean Basin without adequate management of new forests, (vi) very high pressure on forested areas of northern Africa coupled with the demographic enhancement, the expansion of crops and higher livestock pressure, and the more intense and overexploitation of water resources uses on the remaining forested areas, and (vii) scarcity and inequality of human management and policies, depending on the national and/or regional governments and agencies, being unable to counteract the previous changes. We identified appropriate measures of management intervention, using the most adequate techniques and processes to counteract these impacts and thus to conserve the health, service capacity, and biodiversity of Mediterranean forests. Future policies should, moreover, promote research to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms of, and the effects on, nutrient and carbon plant-soil status concurrent with the impacts of aridity and leaching due to the effects of current changes. Finally, we acknowledge the difficulty to obtain an accurate quantification of the impacts of increasing aridity rise that warrants an urgent investment in more focused research to further develop future tools in order to counteract the negative effects of climate change on Mediterranean forests.

AB  - Understanding the development of white sands ecosystems (WSEs) and their occurrence is critical for deter-mining structural diversity in global biodiversity hotspots. WSE has fascinated ecologists for decades, with soil always opined to play a critical role in the development of complex ecosystem vegetation patterns. However, few to no studies have systematically investigated the effect of soil natural capital on the complex vegetation patterns in humid tropical forests that include the occurrence of open savannas. Instead, fires have been advanced as the key driver that sustains and expands open savannas in tropical forest biomes. In this study, we investigated the effects of soil geomorphic factors on vegetation patterns that range from tropical forests to open savannas in a model WSE complex known as the Aripo savannas scientific reserve. Soils were sampled from three white sands landscapes, each containing three vegetation types (open savanna, palm island, and marsh forest). Two transects of five soil sampling sites were randomly sampled in each vegetation type where stratified sampling of micro -topography (hollows and flats) was applied. Samples were analyzed mainly for chemical properties, with some physical and mineralogical properties. Results showed patterns and relationships amongst vegetation types. Parent material was rich in quartz and zircon, poor in alkalis and sesquioxides, and resistant to weathering, forming white sands. Open savannas were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in coarse silt (32.8 %) and fine sand (34.1 %) and lower in fine silt and clay, suggesting a clear sorting associated with aeolian cover sands. In microtopographic areas, the upward gradient of water potential drove matter accumulation in hollows and upward translocation of elements under flat relief. The plant available nutrients and carbon were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in open savannas, demonstrating that plant nutrition was resource dependent. The Al con-centration and pH matched with the vegetation patterns with a significantly decreasing Al concentration from forests (953 ppm) to open savannas (223 ppm) and significantly increasing pH from forests (3.7) to open savanna (4.1). Interestingly, the significantly lower Al concentration and higher pH in the open savanna suggest that these properties though more favorable in this locale, did not support tree growth and therefore were not predominant determinants of vegetation patterns. Quartz dominated all textural fractions, with clay fractions (which increased under forest) having higher levels of non-quartz minerals, e.g., silica. Silica, which is more degradable and initially provided more cations (nutrients and Al) to forest vegetation. Therefore, both texture (clay size) and minerals (clay minerals) together, degraded and delivered more cations. We conclude that WSEs in tropical forests developed on originally poor parent material. Since natural fire regimes are unlikely in this ecosystem, differences in vegetation distribution were not attributable to fires but are related to soil variability due to weathering and pre-weathering sorting. Most likely matter transport by lateral sheet water flow due to soil geomorphology is another factor controlling the development of vegetation patterns within WSE mainly found in humid tropical areas where wet season rainfall exceeds 2000 mm.

AB  - This paper discusses the dynamics of ecosystems and their components in connection with the development of the Aral Sea environmental crisis. The theoretical basis of this study was the idea that the vegetation dynamics under the conditions of deltaic landscape desertification represents an anthropogenically-induced natural hologenetic process involving the replacement of vegetation typical for hydromorphic floodplain and reed-bed biotopes with vegetation of semihydromorphic meadow and solonchak biotopes resulting in the formation of zonal vegetation typical for automorphic biotopes. These endo-ecogenetic successions are determined by the directed reduction in moisture supply in biotopes and accompanying salinization and evolution of soils. The changes occur in both successional and catastrophic ways. In the northern, undeveloped part of the Amu Darya River delta, the reduction of the sea water surface and a sharp drop in water reserves resulted by the 1990s in the formation of environmental conditions typical for desert landscapes: the climate parameters and their regime became close to desert ones, while the groundwater level fell to a depth of 5-10 m, thus, making groundwaters inaccessible to plant roots. Reconstruction of the reservoir system and flooding of former marine bays contribute to the formation of hydromorphic conditions on local sites. Geobotanical studies commenced in the Amu Darya River delta in 1979 and involved route surveys and surveys of topo-ecological profiles passing through the main deltaic relief elements (levees, their slopes, and interchannel depressions) were repeated in the monitoring mode in 1985, 1993, and 1999. Route surveys performed in 2017 showed that the current vegetation dynamics stage involves the formation of desert plant communities. Black saxaul (Haloxylon aphyllum (Minkw.) Iljin) first discovered in the Muynak district in 1993 is actively spreading in the most part of the undeveloped delta that has turned into a wasteland after the extinction of common reed (Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.) communities in the 1970s-1980s. The desert species Krasheninnikovia ceratoides (L.) Gueldenst. that has invaded degrading tugai and sparse arborescent saltwort (Salsola dendroides Pall.) monocoenoses on takyr solonchak soils around the same years formed extensive thickets north of the city of Kungrad. Observations on topo-ecological profiles made it possible to examine individual changes and stages in more detail. On the right bank of the Akdar'ya River that feeds the Mezhdurechenskoe Reservoir, on the Porlytau topo-ecological profile located 3 km southwest of the upland of the same name, over the course of the 40-year observation period, the river washed away a section of the near-channel floodplain and levee 500 m wide and was incised 9 m into the ground following a drop in the erosion base level (i.e., water level in the eastern part of the Greater Sea) by 26 m. Plant communities successions develop slowly. They follow the path of successional replacement of an arboreal Poplar tugai (Populus ariana + Populus pruinosa + Elaeagnus angustifolia-Mixteherbosa with a shrubby tugai with Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. ending in a nearby section of the interchannel depression with a catastrophic change: the death of the Halostachys belangeriana (Moq.) Botsch. community. This community was formed in 1985 as a result of soil salinization in the area previously occupied by reeds.
   In 2017, a slow surface desalination process that began in 1993 due to the illuviation of salts from upper (0-10 cm) horizons to lower ones continued in the soil at all survey points on the profile. For the first time, the desert shrub species Krasheninnikovia ceratoides (L.) Gueldenst. was recorded on the tugai fringe in 2017; over time, this species will probably colonize this entire site characterized by the profile. In the northeastern part of the delta, on the Kunyadarya topo-ecological profile that begins on the right bank of the dry channel of the same name and descends in the southeastern direction to the coastal plain, a degrading Populus diversifolia-Halimodendron halodendron tugai on the levee is being replaced by a tamarisk tugai, which is indicated by the species composition of the community: Populus diversifolia-Tamarixlaxa + Halimodendron halodendron + T. ramosissima-Atriplex tatarica. In 2017, black saxaul was first recorded in a community formed by tall well-developed tamarisks and succulent saltworts located further along the profile on the levee slope. The profile enters a coastal solonchak plain with a Halostachys belangeriana-Climacoptera aralensis community. The salinity profiles of soils under all plant communities have a similar feature: the salt content reaches its maximum in the upper part of the profile (0-10 cm); then it sharply decreases in the 10-20-cm horizon and does not change down the profile to a depth of 50 cm. Salinity profiles of soils on two sites occupied by the tugai have the maximum similarity. The uppermost (0-5 cm) horizon is less saline or somewhat washed out from salts compared to the deeper (5-10 cm) horizon featuring the maximum salt content. In the Halostachys belangeriana community, the salt content reaches its maximum (8.28%) in the surface soil horizon (0-5 cm), then it sharply decreases to 2% in the 10-20-cm horizon, and further decreases down the profile to almost 1%. The salinity profile under tamarisk communities differs from other profiles: overall, it is slightly saline and has two maxima: mild surface salinity (0.5% at a depth of 0-5 cm) and medium salinity (0.8%) at a depth of 20-30 cm. Salinity profiles of soils on the Kunyadarya topo-ecological profile indicate progressive salinization of soils with a clearly pronounced surface-accumulative profile under the impact of pulsating secondary hydromorphism in this area provoked by water flows from the Dzhiltyrbas Bay towards the sea that occur on a periodic basis. In 2017, a newly-formed young woody tugai on the bank of an irrigation canal crossing the degrading Yerkin tugai was described. It differs from the degrading tugai forests described earlier in its full-fledged structure (it has three storeys) and in richness of its plant species composition (12 species). Two liana species are present, and renewal of predominant tree species occurs. The soil under the young tugai is alluvial-meadow-tugai (hydromorphic); it is slightly saline (0.36%) only in the near-surface horizon (0-5 cm). Comparison of data collected on topo-ecological profiles with data collected in the course of previous observations made it possible for the first time to conclude that the changes of plant associations in woody tugai communities in the undeveloped part of the delta under the desertification conditions occurs mainly in a successional way; while herbaceous and shrub communities, especially halophilic ones and their variants, are characterized by predominantly catastrophic changes.
   After their death, long-lasting wastelands are formed on lands previously occupied by such communities where favorable conditions for the introduction of species with different ecology are created. In local hydromorphic conditions with floodplain regimes, the formation and existence of tugai plant communities is possible. The practical significance of the results is that they characterize the diversity of environmental conditions and processes currently occurring in the vegetation and landscapes in the undeveloped part of the Amu Darya River delta and can be applied in resource use and biodiversity conservation practices.

AB  - Human-mediated dispersal of non-native earthworms can cause substantial changes to the functioning and composition of ecosystems previously earthworm-free. Some of these earthworm species have the potential to "geoengineer" soils and increase plant nitrogen (N) uptake. Yet the possible consequences of increased plant N concentrations on rodent grazing remains poorly understood. In this study, we present findings from a common garden experiment with two tundra communities, meadow (forb dominated) and heath (shrub dominated), half of them subjected to 4 years of earthworm presence (Lumbricus spp. and Aporrectodea spp.). Within four summers, our earthworm treatment changed plant community composition by increasing graminoid density by, on average, 94% in the heath vegetation and by 49% in the meadow. Rodent winter grazing was more intense on plants growing in soils with earthworms, an effect that coincided with higher N concentrations in plants, indicating a higher palatability. Even though earthworms reduced soil moisture, plant community productivity, as indicated by vegetation greenness (normalized difference vegetation index), was not negatively impacted. We conclude that earthworm-induced changes in plant composition and trophic interactions may fundamentally alter the functioning of tundra ecosystems.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) play an important role on litter decomposition, which is increasing suffering the negative impact of acid deposition. In this study, we investigated the AMF effects on litter decomposition via suppressing AMF and simulating acid deposition in a subtropical Cinnamomum camphora forest. The results showed that acid deposition and AMF suppression decelerated C. camphora leaf litter decomposition, especially at late decomposition stage; soil water content was the main factor restricting early-stage decomposition. The inhibiting effect of acid deposition was enhanced with acid intensity increase and AMF suppression aggravated the negative effect of acid stress on decomposition. Nitrogen-cycling enzymatic activity was significantly higher in later than in early decomposition stage, and acid deposition and AMF suppression significantly decreased microbial activity. Despite the seasonal effect was overwhelming, we still detected the effects of acid deposition and AMF suppression on litter nutrient release. Without or under low acid deposition, AMF suppression significantly increased organic matter and decreased alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen content of detritusphere soil. Acid deposition significantly reduced soil organic matter content, while high acid deposition intensity increased alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen content after 2- and 12-month decomposition, and decreased it at other months. Both acid deposition and AMF suppression decreased available phosphorus content, but did not affect phosphatase activity. AMF effects on invertase and nitrogen-release enzyme activities, and alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen and available phosphorus contents of detritusphere soil were highly sensitive to acid deposition. Our results revealed that AMF effects on microbial activity and nutrient release during litter decomposition are sensitive to acid deposition.

AB  - Selecting the appropriate indicators and measuring time point numbers is important for accurately examining the shift in soil gross decomposition channel structure. Through a selected case study on a natural forest vs. rainfed arable system over a two-month-long experiment, the utility of three commonly employed indicators (fungi to bacteria ratio (F:B), fungivore to bacterivore ratio (FF:BF), and glucosamine to muramic acid ratio (GlcN:MurN)) were compared to reflect the shift in soil gross decomposition channel structure. The requirement of measuring the time point numbers for the three indicators was also assessed, and we suggest a potential methodology. Our results revealed that the GlcN:MurN ratio was more reliable for assessing the shifts in gross decomposition channel structure for long-term land use changes, while it was less sensitive to short-term drought compared with the other two indicators. The F:B ratio was more applicable than the FF:BF ratio for reflecting both long- and short-term changes. Furthermore, the reliability of the GlcN:MurN ratio was the least dependent on measuring time point numbers. We suggest the use of multiple indicators and the adoption of multiple measuring time points for the overall methodology.

AB  - Aim: The mosaic of savannas that persists in the forest-dominant Congo Basin is thought to be palaeoclimatic relics, but past biogeographical processes that have formed and maintained these systems are poorly understood. Here, we explored the post-Pleistocene biogeography of Gabon's savannas using termites as biological indicators to understand historical and mechanistic factors influencing present-day termite communities in the country's extant savannas.
   Location: Gabon, Central Africa.
   Taxon: Blattodea: Termitoidae.
   Methods: Using standardised transect methods, we sampled termite communities in four disjunct modern savanna areas of Gabon: the centre (Lope), the southeast (Bateke) and the south (Mayombe North and South). Termites at Lope were collected in three habitats (annually burned savannas, savannas with a depressed fire regime and forest). We used DNA barcoding of the COII region to identify termite species and compared abundance, species richness and community composition across areas and habitats.
   Results: Community composition differed greatly between Lope and both Bateke and Mayombe savannas with Lope being exceptionally depauperate and lacking characteristic savanna species. Within Lope, termite abundance and diversity was highest in forests and lowest in annually burned savannas, with a gradual change in species composition across the forest-savanna gradient associated with fire history.
   Main Conclusions: The absence of savanna typical species in Lope savannas challenges current assumptions that these savannas were linked to the south/southeastern savannas during the Pleistocene and suggests a different evolutionary history. Lope savannas may instead have opened as an isolated grassland and never have been contiguous with neighbouring savannas, or were isolated soon after forest expansion began and have now lost savanna-typical species. Furthermore, the patterns of termite community composition in fire suppressed savannas support a hypothesis of rapid change driven by fire frequency where either fire suppression or infrequent burning over 23 years has meant savannas have become ecologically much more forest-like.

AB  - The disease anthrax occurs generally in herbivores and the causative organism (Bacillus anthracis) infects humans who come in contact with infected animals or their products. The persistence of anthrax spores for decades and its lethality contribute to its biowarfare potential. We conducted this systematic review along with risk mapping to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution, clinico-epidemiological, socio-behavioural and programmatic issues pertaining to anthrax in India over the last two decades.Peer reviewed quantitative and qualitative studies and grey literature comprising weekly reports of the 'Integrated Disease Surveillance Program' (IDSP), were accessed for extracting data. IDSP data were used for georeferencing of the villages of anthrax cases; Pseudo-absence was generated to fit a Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) model to develop anthrax risk map. The case fatality rate of cutaneous anthrax ranged from 2% to 38%, while the gastrointestinal and inhalational types were 100% fatal. Our synthesis revealed that human anthrax outbreaks in India were clustered around the eastern coastal regions.The states of Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand reported maximum number of outbreaks. Odisha reported a maximum number of 439 human anthrax cases since 2009, of which Koraput district contributed to 200 cases (46%). While handling or consumption of infected animal product were proximal drivers of these events, poverty, lack of awareness, traditional beliefs and local practices served as facilitatory factors. Other structural determinants were wild life-livestock interface, historical forest loss, soil pH, soil-water balance, organic carbon content, temperature, rainfall and humidity.The programmatic issues identified through this review were lack of active surveillance, non-availability of diagnostic facility at the periphery, delayed reporting, absence of routine livestock vaccination and lack of adequate veterinary services. Interventions based on One-health approach in the country merit immediate policy and program attention; high risk zones for anthrax identified during present investigation, should be prioritized.

AB  - Soil moisture is a crucial factor in the field of meteorology, hydrology, and agricultural sciences. In agricultural production, surface soil moisture (SSM) is crucial for crop yield estimation and drought monitoring. For SSM inversion, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers a trustworthy data source. However, for agricultural fields, the use of SAR data alone to invert SSM is susceptible to the influence of vegetation cover. In this paper, based on Sentinel-1 microwave remote sensing data and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, a convolution neural network optimized by sparrow search algorithm (SSA-CNN) was suggested to invert farmland SSM. The feature parameters were first extracted from pre-processed remote sensing data. Then, the correlation analysis between the extracted feature parameters and field measured SSM data was carried out, and the optimal combination of feature parameters for SSM inversion was selected as the input data of the subsequent models. To enhance the performance of the CNN, the hyper-parameters of CNN were optimized using SSA, and the SSA-CNN model was built for SSM inversion based on the obtained optimal hyper-parameter combination. Three typical machine learning approaches, including generalized regression neural network, random forest, and CNN, were used for comparison to show the efficacy of the suggested method. With an average coefficient of determination of 0.80, an average root mean square error of 2.17 vol.%, and an average mean absolute error of 1.68 vol.%, the findings demonstrated that the SSA-CNN model with the optimal feature combination had a better accuracy among the 4 models. In the end, the SSM of the study region was inverted throughout four phenological periods using the SSA-CNN model. The inversion results indicated that the suggested method performed well in local situations.

AB  - In spring 2021, 50 growing steers and heifers of the Maremmana breed (average age 321 d and weight 287 kg) were rotationally stocked under two different treatments (silvopastoral and pastoral). The aim was to evaluate the influence of grazing system on cattle growth and welfare, and pasture depletion. The experiment was carried out on a real Mediterranean agrosilvopastoral farm, located in central Italy. To implement rotational grazing, 3.69 ha of temporary grassland were split into six paddocks, three for each treatment. Cattle grazed for one week in one paddock and then were moved to the next one for a total of six weeks corresponding to six grazing periods. The group maintained on the silvopastoral system were allowed to access 3.31 ha of a Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) forest. Regarding the average daily gain, a significant interaction was found between the treatment and time. The average daily gain of the animals grazing in the open pasture was 1.20 kg d(-1), while that of the cattle grazing in the silvopastoral system was 1.02 kg d(-1). Despite the rate of growth being within the expected range for the Maremmana breed, the average daily gain of cattle in the silvopastoral system was significantly lower. One of the possible causes of this difference could be the higher energy requirements of the animals due to the different activity levels. The different management did not affect animal welfare indicators. Indeed, the serum cortisol concentration did not vary between treatments and among sampling times, while the hair cortisol concentration decreased significantly during the experiment for both groups. Regarding pasture health, allowing cattle to graze in the forest reduced pasture depletion because of the lower stocking rate and grazing pressure. Further studies are necessary to increase the knowledge of the role of forests and grazing management in other seasons than spring in extensive agrosilvopastoral systems.

AB  - Understanding how and why livestock choose to graze on pasture can provide valuable information to farmers, such as overall pasture use, foraging patterns, and behavior trends. This information may be used to further assist farmers in making management decisions on how to increase production. This study specifically aimed to understand what the important drivers of grazing were, such as landscape attributes (pasture quality, distance to trees, distance to fences, distance to water) and climatic variables (rainfall, temperature), in paddocks comprising either native or improved/introduced grass species, in the Monaro region of SE Australia. Pasture quality was a highly important and a significant variable, along with temperature and elevation for the improved pasture paddock, in contrast to the native paddock, where in addition to elevation and temperature, near distance to trees was more important in determining sheep location. Results from research such as this can provide valuable insights into various grazing behaviors of sheep and also assist in shaping the sustainable management of sheep.Monitoring livestock allows insights to graziers on valuable information such as spatial distribution, foraging patterns, and animal behavior, which can significantly improve the management of livestock for optimal production. This study aimed to understand what potential variables are significant for predicting where sheep spent the most time in native (NP) and improved (IP) paddocks. Wethers (castrated male sheep) were tracked using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars on 15 sheep in the IP and 15 in the NP, respectively, on a property located in the Monaro region of Southern New South Wales, Australia. Trials were performed over four six-day periods in April, July, and November of 2014 and March in 2015. Data were analyzed to understand various trends that may have occurred during different seasons, using random forest models (RFMs). Of the factors investigated, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was significant (p < 0.01) and highly important for wethers in the IP, but not the NP, suggesting that quality of pasture was key for wethers in the IP. Elevation, temperature, and near distance to trees were important and significant for predicting residency of wethers in the IP, as well as the NP. The result of this study highlights the ability of predictive models to provide insights on behavior-based modelling of GPS data and further enhance current knowledge about location-based choices of sheep on paddocks.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important land environment characteristic that connects agriculture, ecology, and hydrology. Surface soil moisture (SSM) prediction can be used to plan irrigation, monitor water quality, manage water resources, and estimate agricultural production. Multi-source remote sensing is a crucial tool for assessing SSM in agricultural areas. The field-measured SSM sample data are required in model building and accuracy assessment of SSM inversion using remote sensing data. When the SSM samples are insufficient, the SSM inversion accuracy is severely affected. An SSM inversion method suitable for a small sample size was proposed. The alpha approximation method was employed to expand the measured SSM samples to offer more training data for SSM inversion models. Then, feature parameters were extracted from Sentinel-1 microwave and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, and optimized using three methods, which were Pearson correlation analysis, random forest (RF), and principal component analysis. Then, three common machine learning models suitable for small sample training, which were RF, support vector regression, and genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, were built to retrieve SSM. Comparison experiments were carried out between various feature optimization methods and machine learning models. The experimental results showed that after sample augmentation, SSM inversion accuracy was enhanced, and the combination of utilizing RF for feature screening and RF for SSM inversion had a higher accuracy, with a coefficient of determination of 0.7256, a root mean square error of 0.0539 cm(3)/cm(3), and a mean absolute error of 0.0422 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed method was finally used to invert the regional SSM of the study area. The inversion results indicated that the proposed method had good performance in regional applications with a small sample size.

AB  - Geophysical methods can provide three-dimensional (3D), spatially continuous estimates of soil moisture. However, point-to-point comparisons of geophysical properties to measure soil moisture data are frequently unsatisfactory, resulting in geophysics being used for qualitative purposes only. This is because (1) geophysics requires models that relate geophysical signals to soil moisture, (2) geophysical methods have potential uncertainties resulting from smoothing and artifacts introduced from processing and inversion, and (3) results from multiple geophysical methods are not easily combined within a single soil moisture estimation framework. To investigate these potential limitations, an irrigation experiment was performed wherein soil moisture was monitored through time, and several surface geophysical datasets indirectly sensitive to soil moisture were collected before and after irrigation: ground penetrating radar, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and frequency domain electromagnetics (FDEM). Data were exported in both raw and processed form, and then snapped to a common 3D grid to facilitate moisture prediction by standard calibration techniques, multivariate regression, and machine learning. A combination of inverted ERT data, raw FDEM, and inverted FDEM data was most informative for predicting soil moisture using a random regression forest model (one-thousand 60/40 training/test cross-validation folds produced root mean squared errors ranging from 0.025-0.046 cm(3)/cm(3)). This cross-validated model was further supported by a separate evaluation using a test set from a physically separate portion of the study area. Machine learning was conducive to a semi-automated model-selection process that could be used for other sites and datasets to locally improve accuracy.

AB  - Carbon in soil is one of the most important indicators of soil fertility. Part of the carbon stored in them is returned to the atmosphere during soil respiration. Climate change and inappropriate land use can accelerate these processes. Our work aimed to determine how soil CO2 emissions change over ten years as a result of litter manipulation treatments. Plots at the Sikfokut DIRT (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments) experimental site include doubling either leaf litter or wood, and removing all aboveground litter, all root inputs, or removing all litter inputs. With the help of this, we were able to examine not only the effects of the different organic matter intake but also the effects of the different microclimates that occur as a result of the treatments. Total soil respiration (root and microbial respiration) is a result of a persistent lack or excess of soil organic matter relative to soil moisture. Based on our studies, the increase in the intensity of root respiration on wetter soils was only half of the increase in respiration associated with decomposition activity. The sustained growth of leaf litter significantly increases soil respiration, which can be partly explained by the more favorable supply of nutrients to the decomposing organisms, and partly by the more favorable microclimatic conditions, however, these effects were only valid in the case of wetter soils. In the dry summer environment, we experienced higher CO2 emissions during litter removal treatments. In the first period between 2002 and 2004, even wetter root removal treatments showed a significantly higher CO2 emission, while in the period 2010-2012, surface litter removal treatments. The permanent removal of surface litter in the drier summer period resulted in the formation of a dense crack network, which increased the CO2 emission of these soils, which increases the soil organic carbon loss of the soil. Our study proves the advantages of mulching in terms of a more favorable microclimate of the soil surface and a balanced carbon balance of the soil-plant system.

AB  - Tropical non-self-supporting plants such as hemiepiphytes and nomadic vines are model organisms for disentangling biotic and environmental correlates which influence their occupancy patterns. We inventoried >4000 individuals from >3000 trees ranging from 1 to 200 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) in a northeastern Amazonian upland forest to address how tree (phorophyte) size, edaphic factors and recruitment strategy influence occupancy, diversity, and compositional patterns of two vascular non-self-supporting plant functional groups. Hemiepiphytes germinate on phorophytes prior to establishing soil connections, whereas nomadic vines initiate their life cycle on the forest floor and subsequently climb phorophytes for crown access, abandoning roots replaced by adventitious connections which may reach the ground. Our results show that larger phorophytes (>= 30 cm DBH) supported more species for both hemiepiphytes and nomadic vines. However, nomadic vines' occupancy probabilities saturated faster at smaller stem sizes than that of hemiepiphytes indicating differential preferences for stem sizes among the two functional groups. For smaller phorophytes (<30 cm DBH), soil correlations were stronger with nomadic vines than hemiepiphytes, whereas no significant differences were detected among functional groups in relation to edaphic factors for larger (>= 30 cm DBH) ones. Finally, a small core group of species showed disproportionately greater abundances among large phorophytes suggesting that autogenic processes differentially promote survivability.

AB  - Accurate estimates of plant transpiration (Tsf) are essential to maximizing the efficient use of water. When only considering the surface canopy resistance (rc), the Penman-Monteith (PM) model is commonly used in Tsf modeling. However, the rc is difficult to measure but it can be accurately estimated using the Jarvis canopy resistance model (JA). Our objectives were to evaluate the rc of apple trees calculated with an inverted PM model integrated with different versions of the JA model for different growth stages and to compare their accuracy using four optimization algorithms, the least squares method (LSM), genetic algorithm (GA), quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO), and the mind evolutionary algorithm (MEA). We explored the effect of environ-mental constraint functions and parameter optimization of three environmental variables, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), net irradiance (Rn), and air temperature (Ta), and of soil water content (theta a) on the accuracy of JA sub -models to calculate apple tree rc and Tsf. In our analysis, we used rainfed data from experiments on an apple orchard conducted during 2008-2010 at Wuwei City on the Loess Plateau of China. We compared 81 segmented JA sub-models (by canopy growth stage), comprising of the combination of the environmental constraint functions that were used to calculate rc. Moreover, the JA sub-models were optimized and results were compared to improve the accuracy of Tsf estimates with five empirical rc models, combined with the PM model. The results showed that sub-model JA3322, i.e., the third constraint for VPD, the third constraint for Rn, the second constraint for Ta, and the second constraint for theta a attained the best estimate of rc with a coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.71), a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE = 0.65), root mean squared error (RMSE = 1257.4 s m-1), and global performance indicator (GPI = 1.0) for the whole growth stage. The equivalent values for the partial canopy stage were 0.78, 0.72, 1203.3 s m-1 and 0.99, and the values for the dense canopy stage were 0.78, 0.77, 445.6 s m-1 and 0.97, respectively. Segmented JA models based on the leaf area index threshold significantly improved the accuracy of rc estimation, where the median R2 and NSE were improved by 7.1 % and 12.4 % in the partial canopy stage and by 12.2 % and 13.4 % in the dense canopy stage. Despite pointing out the best envi-ronmental constraint functions of the JA model in the different growth stages, results indicated that the MEA yielded the most accurate estimates of rc, followed by QPSO, GA, and LSM. Moreover, the JA model with environmental constraints was the most accurate method to estimate the apple tree Tsf, and MEA was the most suitable parameter optimization algorithm. Overall, the findings of this study provide accurate actual water consumption information of apple trees using easily accessible meteorological data for the effective day-to-day water management decision-making of rain-fed apple tree orchards on the Loess Plateau of China previously.

AB  - Red pine plantations may promote more desirable hardwood regeneration than hardwood stands because of differences in: 1) the composition and quantity of tree seeds available, and 2) abiotic and biotic properties of growth and establishment environments. However, information on how distance from hardwood edges, thinning of overstory pine, and site quality shapes hardwood regeneration properties in red pine plantations is scarce. Such information would aid in understanding and managing red pine plantation effects on hardwood regener-ation processes and guide spatial and temporal rotations of such effects across landscapes. To elucidate re-lationships, we monitored hardwood seedlings and canopy openness across transitions from hardwood edges to red pine plantation interiors at 40 sites spanning a site quality gradient in northwestern-lower Michigan. Hardwood seedling density: 1) declined substantially from edges to interiors at all but low-quality sites before stabilizing 30-m into plantations, 2) was reduced, or not affected, by thinning despite positive effects on seedling light environments, and 3) was greater at intermediate than high-and low-quality sites. From edges to interiors, species composition shifted towards Acer rubrum, Quercus species, and Prunus serotina and away from Acer sac-charum, Fagus grandifolia, Fraxinus americana, and Ostrya virginiana. Species increasing in relative abundance and/or density from edges to interiors were generally more drought-tolerant, shade-intolerant, large-seeded, and animal-dispersed than decreasing species. Shifts towards less shade-tolerant species from edges to interiors were consistent with increases in canopy openness and were most pronounced where changes in light were greatest (i. e., thinned plantations on high-quality sites). Changes in hardwood seedling density and composition were likely driven by differences across species in dispersal traits, seed characteristics, and relative adaptation to interior conditions (likely hotter, drier, and nutrient poor). To promote commercially valuable hardwoods, increase mast for wildlife, or improve climatic resiliency, the most suitable targets for conversion to hardwoods may be plantations with significant interiors (i.e., area > 30-m from hardwood edges) on higher quality sites adjacent to desirable seed sources (e.g., Quercus rubra, Prunus serotina, Acer saccharum). More desirable hardwood regener-ation may result from reevaluating thinning timings and intensities originally designed to maximize red pine production. Our results also indicate that intentional management of surrounding hardwood forest composition (i.e., seed sources), within plantation retention of hardwood islands (e.g., mature oak stems), and greater control of Acer rubrum competition may further increase the desirability of hardwood regeneration in red pine plantations.

AB  - Arthropod predators are abundant in turfgrass systems, and they play an important role in managing pests. Understanding the vertical distribution of predation is critical to developing cultural strategies that enhance and conserve predatory services. However, little is known on how the predation is vertically distributed within the turfgrass canopy. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the vertical distribution of predation within the turfgrass canopy. Clay models were used to emulate the general appearance of Noctuidae caterpillars, to estimate the predatory activity. The choice and no-choice experiments were conducted by placing clay models at 2.54, 5.08, and 7.62 cm from the thatch surface and denoted as lower, intermediate, and upper levels, respectively, within turfgrass canopy. The predator-mediated impressions, paired mark, scratch, deep cut mark, deep distortion, prick, dent, stacked surface impression, scooped mark, granulation, and U-shaped mark, were identified on clay models. The incidence and severity of impressions were significantly greater on clay models placed at the lower canopy level than on those placed at the intermediate and upper canopy levels in the choice and no-choice experiments (P < 0.05). Thus, predators are more likely to find their prey at the soil level. This information can be used to refine management strategies, such as mowing height and insecticide use for effectively managing soil-borne and foliar-feeding arthropod pests and beneficial arthropods.

AB  - Over the last millennia, wetlands have been sequestering carbon from the atmosphere via photosynthesis at a higher rate than releasing it and, therefore, have globally accumulated 550 x 1015 g of carbon, which is equivalent to 73% of the atmospheric carbon pool. The accumulation of organic carbon in wetlands is effectuated by phenolic compounds, which suppress the degradation of soil organic matter by inhibiting the activity of organic-matter-degrading enzymes. The enzymatic removal of phenolic compounds by bacterial tyrosinases has historically been blocked by anoxic conditions in wetland soils, resulting from waterlogging. Bacterial tyrosinases are a subgroup of oxidoreductases that oxidatively remove phenolic compounds, coupled to the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. The biochemical properties of bacterial tyrosinases have been investigated thoroughly in vitro within recent decades, while investigations focused on carbon fluxes in wetlands on a macroscopic level have remained a thriving yet separated research area so far. In the wake of climate change, however, anoxic conditions in wetland soils are threatened by reduced rainfall and prolonged summer drought. This potentially allows tyrosinase enzymes to reduce the concentration of phenolic compounds, which in turn will increase the release of stored carbon back into the atmosphere. To offer compelling evidence for the novel concept that bacterial tyrosinases are among the key enzymes influencing carbon cycling in wetland ecosystems first, bacterial organisms indigenous to wetland ecosystems that harbor a TYR gene within their respective genome (tyr(+)) have been identified, which revealed a phylogenetically diverse community of tyr(+ )bacteria indigenous to wetlands based on genomic sequencing data. Bacterial TYR host organisms covering seven phyla (Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, and Proteobacteria) have been identified within various wetland ecosystems (peatlands, marshes, mangrove forests, bogs, and alkaline soda lakes) which cover a climatic continuum ranging from high arctic to tropic ecosystems. Second, it is demonstrated that (in vitro) bacterial TYR activity is commonly observed at pH values characteristic for wetland ecosystems (ranging from pH 3.5 in peatlands and freshwater swamps to pH 9.0 in soda lakes and freshwater marshes) and toward phenolic compounds naturally present within wetland environments (p-coumaric acid, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, catechin, and epicatechin). Third, analyzing the available data confirmed that bacterial host organisms tend to exhibit in vitro growth optima at pH values similar to their respective wetland habitats. Based on these findings, it is concluded that, following increased aeration of previously anoxic wetland soils due to climate change, TYRs are among the enzymes capable of reducing the concentration of phenolic compounds present within wetland ecosystems, which will potentially destabilize vast amounts of carbon stored in these ecosystems. Finally, promising approaches to mitigate the detrimental effects of increased TYR activity in wetland ecosystems and the requirement of future investigations of the abundance and activity of TYRs in an environmental setting are presented.

AB  - Tigilanol tiglate (EBC-46) is a small-molecule natural product under development for the treatment of cancers in humans and companion animals. The drug is currently produced by purification from the Australian rainforest tree Fontainea picrosperma (Euphorbiaceae). As part of a selective-breeding program to increase EBC-46 yield from F. picrosperma plantations, we investigated potential gene biomarkers associated with biosynthesis of EBC-46. Initially, we identified individual plants that were either high (>0.039%) or low EBC-46 (<0.008%) producers, then assessed their differentially expressed genes within the leaves and roots of these two groups by quantitative RNA sequencing. Compared to low EBC-46 producers, high-EBC-46-producing plants were found to have 145 upregulated genes and 101 downregulated genes in leaves and 53 upregulated genes and 82 downregulated genes in roots. Most of these genes were functionally associated with defence, transport, and biosynthesis. Genes identified as expressed exclusively in either the high or low EBC-46-producing plants were further validated by quantitative PCR, showing that cytochrome P450 94C1 in leaves and early response dehydration 7.1 and 2-alkenal reductase in roots were consistently and significantly upregulated in high-EBC-46 producers. In summary, this study has identified biomarker genes that may be used in the selective breeding of F. picrosperma.

AB  - Boreal forests often have a dense understorey of ericaceous dwarf shrubs with ecological adaptations that contrast those of the canopy-forming trees. It is therefore important to quantify contributions by understorey shrubs to ecosystem processes and disentangle shrub- and tree-driven responses to climatic factors. We quantified soil respiration driven by the pine canopy and the ericaceous shrub understorey over 3 years, using a factorial pine root exclusion and shrub removal experiment in a mature Pinus sylvestris forest. Soil temperature and moisture-related responses of respiration attributed to autotrophs (shrubs, pine roots) and heterotrophs were compared. Additionally, we assessed effects of interactions between these functional groups on soil nitrogen availability and respiration. Understorey shrubs accounted for 22% +/- 10% of total autotrophic respiration, reflecting the ericaceous proportion of fine root production in the ecosystem. Heterotrophic respiration constituted about half of total soil respiration. Shrub-driven respiration was more susceptible to drought than heterotrophic- and pine-driven respiration. While the respiration attributed to canopy and understorey remained additive, indicating no competitive release, the plant guilds competed for soil N. Synthesis. Ericaceous understorey shrubs accounted for a small, yet significant, share of total growing season soil respiration. Overlooking understorey respiration may lead to erroneous partitioning and modelling of soil respiration mediated by functional guilds with contrasting responses to soil temperature and moisture. A larger contribution by heterotrophs and pine root-associated organisms to soil respiration under drought conditions could have important implications for soil organic matter accumulation and decomposition as the climate changes in boreal forests.

AB  - Animals represent an overlooked source of horizontal redistribution of primary production and concentration of elements in ecosystems. For example, the high nutrient concentration of excretions by animals creates a mosaic of short-term nutrient hotspots. However, how this impacts soil microbial communities, especially fungi, and in turn plant species diversity remains little known. This study quantified the temporal dynamics of soil mineral nitrogen (N) availability and its relationship with soil fungal community and functional group composition in simulated high-N patches in an Amazonian rain forest. We hypothesised that (H1) changes in local resource dynamics would increase the abundance of pathotrophs and reduce that of saprotrophs and that, (H2) compared with previously reported bacterial community dynamics, fungi would be more resilient after a pulse disturbance event. A single urea pulse was applied and the relationship between fungal community composition and functional groups and soil N availability were determined before and twice after the urea treatment. An increase in mineral N availability and soil pH two months after the applied urea pulse was found to be associated with significant changes in fungal community composition and the abundance of functional groups. There was a notable decrease in the relative abundance of saprotrophs, accompanied by an increase in plant pathogenic fungi. Five months after the treatment, no differences were detected either in mineral N availability and soil pH or the composition of fungal communities and functional groups between the control and urea treatment. Synthesis. By locally favouring the abundance of plant pathogens, temporally short-lived, but frequent high-N patches created by animal excretions could potentially be involved in maintaining spatially and temporally variable soil microbial diversity and thus contributing to high plant community diversity in tropical rain forests as predicted by the Janzen-Connell hypothesis. The tendency of soil fungal communities in this study to return to their initial composition after 5 months suggests that they are resilient to perturbation by N pulse, and more so than previously observed in bacterial communities.

AB  - Earthworms exert a great impact on soil physical and chemical properties through feeding, burrowing, and casting activities. These activities can further affect soil erosion processes. However, we have insufficient knowledge on the effects of earthworm activities on soil erosion. In this study, we quantified the effects of earthworm activities on soil water distribution, runoff rate, and soil erosion rate under three slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees) through a laboratory-simulated rainfall experiment. The uniform rainfall intensity (80 mm h(-1)) was set, and the rainfall duration after runoff generation was set to 60 min. Results showed that earthworm increased soil water infiltration and soil water storage (SWS). The increments in SWS were 41.2, 24.0, and 34.9 mm, respectively, in the tanks with earthworms at the slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees, which were 93%, 51%, and 70% higher than the values of the control plots (21.3, 15.9, and 20.5 mm). Compared with the control plots, earthworm activities reduced the runoff rate at slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees by 70%, 13%, and 39%, respectively; and increased soil erosion rate at slope gradients of 10 degrees and 15 degrees by 42% and 46%, respectively. Through their feeding, burrowing, and casting activities, earthworm increased soil water infiltration, reduced surface runoff, and increased soil erosion. This study provides insights into the effects of soil animals on soil erosion processes, and these data could then be incorporated into existing soil erosion simulation models or provide a basis for new models.

AB  - Soil salinization is a serious problem worldwide and has resulted in large areas of abandoned land in Northwest China. In order to ensure the stability of cultivated land and food security, abandoned salinized farmland was reclaimed. However, the response of the nematode community to the reclamation remains unclear. In order to assess the response of the nematode community to reclamation and examine the relationships between soil properties and nematodes, we identified nematodes to the genus levels and determined their trophic groups from four reclamation treatments: natural succession (CK), cropland (CL), grassland (GL), and woodland (WL). The results showed that the artificial reclamation treatments significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN), while significantly decreased electrical conductivity (EC) in compared with that of CK. Compared with CK, CL and GL significantly increased significantly in the total nematode abundance. However, CL had the lowest Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H'), generic richness (GR) and trophic diversity (TD) among four treatments. Compared with CK, nematode food webs of GL and WL were more mature. SOC and DOC were the main factors driving nematode community variation. The analysis of nematode community structure provided important indicators of changes in soil food webs during the reclamation of salinized farmland.

AB  - Amphibians are vital elements of ecosystems, serving as predator and prey. Their biphasic nature makes them dependent on aquatic and terrestrial habitats; as wet-skinned ectotherms, they are vulnerable to a range of environmental threats, including climate change. Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is becoming warmer and drier, and some wetlands important to amphibians have diminished. Continued climate change is predicted to reduce snowpack, soil moisture, and forest cover. We used data from models of future climate and vegetation cover to mechanistically model how climate change might affect the movements of Western Toads (Anaxyrus boreas) across the landscape of three test areas in YNP for the years 2050 and 2090, compared to 2000 as a baseline. Least-cost path analysis produced mixed results: for 2050 and 2090, physiological costs of movement increased in one test area and decreased in another; they were mixed in the third. These changes generally reflect the preference by toads for more open forests. Estimating costs for other species of YNP amphibians produced more negative results. For Columbia Spotted Frogs (Rana luteiventris) and Boreal Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris maculata) (both more aquatic and less adapted to terrestrial habitats), movement costs increased by about 2-15X. Reduced frequency or duration of rain events might limit the nocturnal movements of Western Tiger Salamanders (Ambystoma mavortium). Climate change may not have negative impacts on all amphibians throughout YNP, but increased movement costs for terrestrial habitats will accentuate effects of drying wetlands in at least parts of YNP. Land management actions that preserve habitat structure of both forest and low shrub cover may help mitigate continued drying conditions of climate change.

AB  - The tropical area has a large area of peatland, which is an important ecosystem that is regarded as home by millions of people, plants and animals. However, the dried-up and degraded peatland becomes extremely easy to burn, and in case of fire, it will further release transboundary haze. In order to protect the peatland, an improved tropical peatland fire weather index (FWI) system is proposed by combining the ground water level (GWL) with the drought code (DC). In this paper, LoRa based IoT system for peatland management and detection was deployed in Raja Musa Forest Reserve (RMFR) in Kuala Selangor, Malaysia. Then, feasibility of data collection by the IoT system was verified by comparing the correlation between the data obtained by the IoT system and the data from Malaysian Meteorological Department (METMalaysia). An improved model was proposed to apply the ground water level (GWL) for Fire Weather Index (FWI) formulation in Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). Specifically, Drought Code (DC) is formulated using GWL, instead of temperature and rain in the existing model. From the GWL aggregated from the IoT system, the parameter is predicted using machine learning based on a neural network. The results show that the data monitored by the IoT system has a high correlation of 0.8 with the data released by METMalaysia, and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and real values of the ground water level of the two sensor nodes deployed through neural network machine learning are 0.43 and 12.7 respectively. This finding reveals the importance and feasibility of the ground water level used in the prediction of the tropical peatland fire weather index system, which can be used to the maximum extent to help predict and reduce the fire risk of tropical peatland.

AB  - Seedling recruitment can be strongly affected by the composition of nearby plant species. At the neighborhood scale (on the order of tens of meters), adult conspecifics can modify soil chemistry and the presence of host microbes (pathogens and mutualists) across their combined canopy area or rooting zones. At local or small spatial scales (on the order of one to few meters), conspecific seed or seedling density can influence the strength of intraspecific light and resource competition and also modify the density-dependent spread of natural enemies such as pathogens or invertebrate predators. Intrinsic correlation between proximity to adult conspecifics (i.e., recruitment neighborhood) and local seedling density, arising from dispersal, makes it difficult to separate the independent and interactive factors that contribute to recruitment success. Here, we present a field experiment in which we manipulated both the recruitment neighborhood and seedling density to explore how they interact to influence the growth and survival of Dryobalanops aromatica, a dominant ectomycorrhizal tree species in a Bornean tropical rainforest. First, we found that both local seedling density and recruitment neighborhood had effects on performance of D. aromatica seedlings, though the nature of these impacts varied between growth and survival. Second, we did not find strong evidence that the effect of density on seedling survival is dependent on the presence of conspecific adult trees. However, accumulation of mutualistic fungi beneath conspecifics adults does facilitate establishment of D. aromatica seedlings. In total, our results suggest that recruitment near adult conspecifics was not associated with a performance cost and may have weakly benefitted recruiting seedlings. Positive effects of conspecifics may be a factor facilitating the regional hyperabundance of this species. Synthesis: Our results provide support for the idea that dominant species in diverse forests may escape the localized recruitment suppression that limits abundance in rarer species.

AB  - Coprophanaeus ensifer (Germar) is a large dung beetle species primarily scavenger with paracoprid habits, habitually removing and burying parts of the food resource to build its nest and feed its larvae. This species is widely distributed in central-eastern South America and its association with decomposing carcasses confers great potential for forensic entomology. This study aimed to characterize behavioral aspects of C. ensifer associated with decomposing pig carcasses in the Cerrado of Central Brazil. Observational expeditions were carried out in the National Park of Brasilia (PNB), Federal District. Three pig carcasses of approximately 5 kg were exposed for a 30-day period on three typically rainy months. Behavioral observations were made daily in loco at twilight/nighttime throughout the decomposition process. This study comprised 45 h of observation. A total of 34 individuals (11 males and 23 females) of C. ensifer were observed and marked. The following events/behaviors were observed: copulation, flight, feeding/perforation of the carcasses, scattering of carcasses portions, soil turning, opening of tunnels below/around the carcasses, burying of carcasses portions, nesting, and agonistic behavior/fighting. The behaviors of feeding, scattering of the carcasses, turning the soil, and opening of tunnels were observed in a high frequency, regardless of sex. The species is most attracted by substrates on the intermediate stages of active decomposition and causes important actions on the carcasses such as drilling and dismemberment. Behavioral descriptions and forensic implications are discussed in the text.

AB  - Although selenium (Se) is an essential microelement for humans and animals, it is a potentially toxic element due to its bioaccumulation potential. In this study, Se fertilizer was supplied in a greenhouse vegetable (cucumber) plantation using an innovative system consisting of nanobubbles (NB_Se) and compared to that under conventional conditions of fertigation (C_Se) with six doses. The results revealed that NB_Se significantly reduced soil Se accumulation (38%-144%) and increased cucumber Se content compared with the C_Se treatments at the same Se dose. NB_Se significantly lowered the soil bacterial diversity, with an initial increase and then decrease with the Se doses. Bacterial associations and potential keystone taxa also differed between the NB_Se and C_Se. The greater abundance of oxidizing bacteria (indicated by the function composition of bacterial community) and the improved soil redox environment created by NBs sustained more available Se for plants, leading to a reduction in soil Se residual and an increase in the plant Se content. Our results highlight the feasibility and efficiency of NB_Se and demonstrate the important implications of Se for the maintenance of soil health and sustainability.

AB  - Dung beetles are excellent indicators of ecosystem ecological integrity, accomplishing an essential role in nutrient cycling process that includes fertilization and soil aeration. Nevertheless, very little is known about the influence of season variation on the assemblage composition and ecological function of dung beetles from high Andean zones. We aimed to investigate the seasonal effect on the diversity and ecological function of dung beetles in terms of biomass. We sampled two pasture patches of the "Reserva Biologica Encenillo", located in Cundinamarca-Colombia, using ten pitfall traps baited with feces placed 50 m apart for 24 hours. This sample design was replicated during each season (dry, transition, and rain). A significant seasonal variation was documented, demonstrating an important association with the rainy season. Significant differences were found for the biomass between species and seasons. The species with the highest biomass was Homocopris achamas. It is evident that high Andean pastures assemblages have low diversity, due to the strong human disturbance, the pressures associated with the altitude, and the evolutionary dynamics of these regions. The marked seasonality of the registered species and the close association with the rainy season are consistent with the pattern established for the Neotropical region. Likewise, a strong seasonal variation of the biomass is evident, which could have a significant impact on the ecological functionality and the ecosystem services in this habitat. In future studies, it is necessary to quantify the functional contribution of the species and their seasonal variation to contribute to their conservation.

AB  - The impacts of climate change on ecosystems are manifested in how organisms respond to episodic and continuous stressors. The conversion of coastal forests to salt marshes represents a prominent example of ecosystem state change, driven by the continuous stress of sea-level rise (press), and episodic storms (pulse). Here, we measured the rooting dimension and fall direction of 143 windthrown eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) trees in a rapidly retreating coastal forest in Chesapeake Bay (USA). We found that tree roots were distributed asymmetrically away from the leading edge of soil salinization and towards freshwater sources. The length, number, and circumference of roots were consistently higher in the upslope direction than downslope direction, suggesting an active morphological adaptation to sea-level rise and salinity stress. Windthrown trees consistently fell in the upslope direction regardless of aspect and prevailing wind direction, suggesting that asymmetric rooting destabilized standing trees, and reduced their ability to withstand high winds. Together, these observations help explain curious observations of coastal forest resilience, and highlight an interesting nonadditive response to climate change, where adaptation to press stressors increases vulnerability to pulse stressors.

AB  - Earthworm population density has been little studied in Kumaun Himalayas in different land use systems collectively. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different land use systems along an altitudinal gradient on earthworm population density in Kumaun Himalayas. Earthworms were sampled in seven different sites from three different land use systems (cultivated, agro-forest and forest systems) in every season (summer, rainy and winter) from two different monoliths (0-15 and 16-30 cm) and were sorted on the basis of their age-structure (clitellates and aclitellates) from May 2015-April 2017. Eight species of earthworms were recorded from the studied sites belonging to two different families-Megascolicidae and Lumbricidae. Earthworm population density varied significantly among land use system; they were recorded highest in forest system i.e. 47% (Nainital-2544 ind. m(-2)); intermediate in the agro-forest system i.e. 37% (Jeolikot-1102 ind. m(-2)); lowest in the cultivated system i.e. 20% (Kiccha-890 ind. m(-2)). Their density tended to be higher in the rainy season and more concentrated (95.19% of total earthworms) on the upper monolith (16-30 cm) irrespective of the land use. The age structure of earthworms indicated that clitellates were more abundant than aclitellates (1:0.8) for all three land use systems. A significant positive correlation was observed between the earthworm population density with soil pH (r = 0.711; P < 0.05), soil C (r = 0.784; P < 0.05) and soil N (r = 0.783; P < 0.05). One way ANOVA results showed that monolith (F = 261.99; P < 0.001), sites (F = 7.28; P < 0.001) and seasons (F = 11.8; P < 0.001) has significant effect on earthworm population density. The results obtained suggested that the absence of anthropic factors in the forest system has led to the higher earthworm population density as compared to the agro-forest and cultivated systems in Kumaun Himalayas along with the altitude.

AB  - Termites have a high biomass in tropical ecosystems, exerting a marked influence on the populations of their predators and on the processes of decomposition and formation of soils. During seasonal dispersion flights, colonies release a large number of alate individuals, however, the nutrient pools involved in this process are not known. The present study estimated the nutrient yields transferred at ground level from termite dispersion flights in an area of dry forest Caatinga, in the semiarid region of Brazil. For this purpose, trays employed on the ground for 12 months collected the alates. The annual biomass of the alates at ground level was estimated at 0.588 g (dry mass) m- 2, corresponding to a density of 164 individuals m- 2. Annual transfers of C and N were estimated at 0.280 g m- 2 and 0.039 g m- 2, respectively. The C and N represented 54.11 and 8.11% of the alates dry mass, respectively, with an average C:N ratio of 6.8:1. An annual yield of protein 2.3 kg ha-1 and fat 2.7 kg ha-1 was estimated, corresponding to 39,365 kcal ha-1. Alates flights transfer nutrients to the soil, which can be deposited in its surface layer or incorporated to the upper trophic levels, acting as a seasonal pulse of nutrients. This happens, basically in sync with the reproductive period of several of its predators in the Caatinga, including birds and lizards, which are in greater demand for food resources to feed their young. Anthropogenic disturbances and changes in the Caatinga's climate, especially those related to their rainfall pattern, may lead to a decrease of termite populations, affecting the seasonal pulses of nutrient release from the colonies via flights of alates.

AB  - Land use change in the Southern Grasslands biome with the introduction of exotic, fast-growing forest species is a controversial topic, because of the potential effect on water and soil resources. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of afforesting degraded grassland on streamflow and sedimentation in subtropical headwater catchments. Two small, headwater catchments were studied, one planted with Eucalyptus saligna (EC: 0.83 km(2)) and another with grasslands and extensive livestock (GC: 1.10 km(2)). Rainfall, runoff, and sediment discharge were monitored from September 2013 to March 2017. The results show two-fold greater surface runoff and sediment yield occurred in GC than in EC. Maximum and mean runoff coefficients were, respectively, 45.5 and 10.2% in GC, and 12.4 and 2.2% in EC; suspended sediment yield was, respectively, 67.9 and 22.4 Mg km(-2) in GC and EC; and bed load sediment yield was only 0.053 and 0.006 Mg km(-2). El Nino year with high rainfall produced the greatest annual sediment yield, with values 4.2 times greater in GC (167.7 Mg km(-2)) than in EC (39.9 Mg km(-2)). Hydrographs/sedimentographs synchronization and hysteresis patterns suggest faster sediment delivery in GC than in EC, but further studies are needed to conciliate sediment sources results with sediment fingerprinting. Staggered forest harvest (21% of the planted eucalyptus) led to sediment yield comparable to the observed during the pre-harvest period, and lower than in grassland catchment. In conclusion, well-managed forest plantations, including staggered forest harvesting and preservation of riparian forest, are less prone to sedimentation than degraded grassland under intensive grazing. Well-managed afforestation of degraded lands contributes to soil conservation in the studied region, whereas low ecological performance of degraded grassland calls for soil and pasture management practices to increase forage offer to grazing animals, while conserving soil and water resources in the catchments.

AB  - Although the vast majority of critically endangered Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri) inhabit low-elevation rain forests, current insights into this ape's life history and ecology stem predominantly from 2 small populations ranging in highland habitats. Here, we provide an initial and non-exhaustive overview of food items of Grauer's gorillas in the Nkuba Conservation Area (NCA), a lower-elevation (500-1,500 m) forest located between Kahuzi-Biega National Park and Maiko National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Community-based conservation efforts at the NCA aim to protect a population of unhabituated Grauer's gorillas, which we have studied since 2014. Between 2014 and 2020, we simultaneously tracked 1-3 gorilla groups and recorded a total of 10,514 feeding signs on at least 100 plant species, ants, termites, and fungi. Vegetative plant parts (plant stems, leaves, pith, bark, and roots), especially of Marantaceae and Fabaceae, made up close to 90% of recorded feeding signs, with fruit accounting for most of the remainder and a small (<1%) number of feeding signs on invertebrates and fungi. We found that the most frequently recorded food items were consumed year-round, though fruit intake seems to peak in the September-December wet season, possibly reflecting patterns in fruit phenology. The diet of Grauer's gorillas in the NCA differed from that of Grauer's gorillas in highland habitat and instead showed similarities with Grauer's gorillas at the lowland forest of Itebero and with western lowland gorillas (G. gorilla), which live under ecologically comparable conditions.

AB  - Tropical mountains encompass a wide range of environmental conditions and are useful models for studying drivers of community structure. Invertebrate species richness and abundance show various elevational patterns. However, the drivers of these differences are not well understood, although microhabitat complexity is potentially important. We studied ground-dwelling ants using pitfall trapping and hand collection on Mt. Wilhelm (Papua New Guinea) from 169 to 3,795 m a. s. l. We tested for the effects of elevation and leaf litter depth (as a measure of microhabitat complexity) on ant abundance, species richness, and composition. We sampled 118 species, with ants present up to 2,331 m a. s. l. Species richness peaked at mid-elevation (similar to 700 m), but the elevational pattern for abundance varied depending on sampling scale. Leaf litter depth negatively affected abundance once elevation had been accounted for, while elevation and litter depth had an interactive effect on species richness. Species richness was positively related to litter depth at lower elevations, but negatively above similar to 700 m. Species composition varied with elevation and less strongly with leaf litter depth. We speculate that in the lowlands, litter depth rather than temperature limits ant communities. At high elevations, the deeper litter decreases temperature of the litter layer, and temperature becomes limiting. At mid-elevations, temperature is not yet too low, and litter is still relatively deep, hence generating a mid-elevation peak in ant richness. Our results may explain differing richness-elevation patterns of litter arthropods around the world and provide testable predictions for future studies on this topic.

AB  - Forest steppe of the Central Chernozem Region (CCR) of Russia belongs to the zone of highly productive pine forests. In 2015, for the first time a partial destabilization of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) was recorded within the territory of the CCR. It affected the population, organism and cellular levels of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). The destabilization was caused by the 8-year heatwave of 2007-2014 followed by a sharp drop in the water table and four severe droughts (2007, 2010, 2012, and 2014). The analysis was carried out on two sites of pine forest plantations growing in the environmentally sound region: the Stupino test site (Voronezh region, typical plantation for the CCR) and the Usman site (Lipetsk region, lands with elevated groundwater level). The results of morphological, cytogenetic and biochemical studies of model trees of the Stupino test site during the following periods are presented: 4 optimal years in terms of weather conditions, 2014 drought year and 2015 destabilization year. It was found that prolonged hydrothermal stress resulted in the transition of pine from the basic equilibrium state to a slightly nonequilibrium state. The trigger mechanism for changing their vital state was a severe autumn soil drought in 2014, after which the plants became weakened right before winter. A decrease in cone bioproductivity by the traits of seed fullness and the total number of seeds per cone, a change in population sampling structure, an increase in the number of mitosis pathologies, and an increase in proline content in needles were observed despite optimal weather conditions in 2015. The recovery of species was studied for three subsequent optimal years on the example of the Stupino and Usman populations. Experimental data indicate that the processes of vital state normalization involve profound changes in metabolism and require certain energy expenditures. It took the Stupino population longer to return to the regional norm, which indicates a different depth of destabilization of the tree genetic material of the studied populations.

AB  - Although recent research has examined the micro-distribution of nematodes and environmental factors involved, few studies have analyzed the spatial distribution of economically important nematode species using geostatistical techniques in irrigated sugarcane cultivation. The present study aimed to investigate the spatial dependence magnitude of Pratylenchus and Meloidogyne in irrigated and non-irrigated sugarcane plantation areas, at different times, using geostatistics. The study was carried out in the city of Timbauba-PE between September 2014 and November 2015. Soils were collected from 36 georeferenced points to estimate the degree of spatial dependence among the populations, using geostatistical analysis. After variograms adjustment, kriging and mapping of the nematode spatial distributions in the areas were performed. It was found that irrigation affected the spatial distribution and correlation lengths of both plant-parasitic nematodes. Irrigation was a key factor in the aggregation of Meloidogyne, whereas for Pratylenchus irrigation allowed its dispersion in the area over time.

AB  - In the Colombian Pacific region, the naidi palm, Euterpe oleracea Mart. (Arecaceae) produces high-value fruit due to its high nutritional quality, representing an economic benefit to the families of the region. In this study, we evaluated the occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the rhizospheric soil of E. oleracea in Bajo Calima, Buenaventura. This is the first report of AMF of E. oleracea in Colombia. Surface soil samples (0 - 10 cm) were collected in two areas (L1 - under the influence of rice cropping and L2 - tropical rainforest). The chemical properties of the soil, the number of spores, and the mycorrhizal colonization in the root were established. We observed low mycorrhizal colonization (10 % in L1 and 4 % in L2), negatively correlated to the content of available phosphorus in the soil. However, significant differences between areas (p = 0.009) were recorded. Globose, subglobose, and ovoid spores were observed (660 and 791 spores/100 g soil in L1 and L2, respectively). Spores are represented in several morphotypes that can be classified as Claroideoglomeraceae, Glomeraceae, Diversisporaceae, Paraglomeraceae, and Ambisporaceae. High available P content (13.1 mg/kg in L1 and 20.5 mg/kg in L2), among other edaphic factors associated, could explain the low mycorrhizal colonization observed, especially when there are not enough studies linking ecological factors with AMF dynamics in tropical rainforests. On the other hand, spore abundances reported in the rhizospheric soil of E. oleracea suggest a high potential to explore indigenous AMF activity in the Colombian Pacific region to achieve sustainable production practices in this palm.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a master variable that modulates the form and function of many ecosystems. Approximately, half of the mass of DOM is carbon. Fluxes of DOM transfer carbon and other vital elements between ecosystems and between organisms (e.g., trees to bacteria) and components (e.g., vegetation to soil) within ecosystems. The DOM flux out of trees and understory plants to the forest floor is a poorly studied component of the carbon and nutrient budgets of forest ecosystems. In freshwater systems, studies of DOM transport through terrestrial systems usually start at the stream. However, the interception of rainwater by vegetation marks the beginning of the terrestrial hydrological cycle making plant canopies the crowning headwaters of terrestrial aquatic carbon cycling. Rainwater interacts with canopies picking up DOM, which is then exported from the plant in stemflow and throughfall, where stemflow denotes water flowing down the plant stem and throughfall is the water that drips from and through the leaves, branches, and epiphytes of the canopy. As nearly all studies of vegetation-derived DOM to date report DOM derived from tree canopies (tree-DOM), in this chapter we discuss the quality, potential sources, and potential fates of tree-DOM. We then describe and discuss the drivers of variation of quantitative fluxes of tree-DOM and place these quantitative fluxes in biogeochemical and ecological contexts at scales ranging from the individual tree, forest, and watershed to global trends.

AB  - Lumbricus terrestris is an epi-anecic earthworm, normally occupying a 1-2 m deep, vertical burrow. Some observations suggest that population persistence in much shallower burrows could be possible in a mild and humid climate. This was further investigated at an ex -industrial site in NW England, with a topsoil less than 0.15 m deep, above inert subsoil formed from semi-weathered Leblanc waste. L. terrestris were collected from an adjacent woodland soil and introduced into unoccupied areas. After four days, settlement and survival were studied by targeted sampling of half of the individuals, and depth of burrows were measured by resin casting. After 14 months, the second half of inoculated areas were studied and after another four years a further general survey occurred. After four days, 41 % of targeted worms were recovered, with 0.11 m mean burrow depth and burrows ending at the subsoil interface. After 14 months, all age classes of L. terrestris were present and burrow depth had not changed. After five years, adult, juvenile and hatchling L. terrestris were present, demonstrating establishment of a breeding population. In a parallel laboratory experiment, with site topsoil and subsoil in Evans' boxes, L. terrestris avoided subsoil and constructed U-shaped burrows. The results show that through flexible burrow construction, L. terrestris can survive above highly constraining subsoil conditions. This is likely to be only possible where severe droughts are uncommon, and topsoil does not freeze in winter.

AB  - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii) is an important species in the Pacific Northwest including California forests. Due to the increasing need for reforestation in this region after widespread disturbances related to changes in climate (i.e., drought, megafires, beetle mortality), it is necessary to examine the factors that contribute to performance and survival of planted seedlings in reforestation projects. While most conifer planting in northern California is done in spring, fall planting is also an alternative practice used. With the recent increase in demand of seedlings for reforestation projects beyond which the current infrastructure is capable of, particularly in spring, expanding the fall planting season has potential to mitigate this and constraints to the spring labor force. Here, we studied the first-year performance of both spring and fall planted Douglas-fir seedlings for different seed sources and nursery cultural timings at a single site in northern California. We found that the fall planting can be successful in October or November, while planting earlier requires immediately favorable temperature and soil moisture conditions. Later sowing and blackout regimes also resulted in increases in height growth and bud development while also reducing damage due to spring freezes. For spring planting, early sow and blackout resulted in earlier bud break, while later sow, blackout, and lift dates benefited the first-year growth of height and diameter.

AB  - 1. The effects of selection on an organism's genome are hard to detect on small spatial scales, as gene flow can swamp signatures of local adaptation. Therefore, most genome scans to detect signatures of environmental selection are performed on large spatial scales; however, divergent selection on the local scale (e.g. between contrasting soil conditions) has also been demonstrated, in particular for herbaceous plants.2. Here, we hypothesised that in topographically complex landscapes, microenvironment variability is strong enough to leave a selective footprint in the genomes of long-lived organisms. To test this, we investigated paired south- versus north-facing Pinus pinaster stands on the local scale, with trees growing in close vicinity (<= 820 m distance between paired south- and north-facing stands), in a Mediterranean mountain area. While trees on north-facing slopes experience less radiation, trees on south-facing slopes suffer from especially harsh conditions, particularly during the dry summer season.3. Two outlier analyses consistently revealed five putatively adaptive loci (out of 4034), in candidate genes two of which encoded non-synonymous substitutions. Additionally, one locus showed consistent allele frequency differences in all three stand pairs indicating divergent selection despite high gene flow on the local scale. Permutation tests demonstrated that our findings were robust.4. Functional annotation of these candidate genes revealed biological functions related to abiotic stress response, such as water availability, in other plant species.5. Synthesis. Our study highlights how divergent selection in heterogeneous microenvironments shapes and maintains the functional genetic variation within populations of long-lived forest tree species, being the first to focus on adaptive genetic divergence between south- and north-facing slopes within continuous forest stands. This is especially relevant in the current context of climate change, as this variation is at the base of plant population responses to future climate.

AB  - Private groundwater wells can be unmonitored sources of contaminated water that can harm human health. Developing models that predict exposure could allow residents to take action to reduce risk. Machine learning models have been successful in predicting nitrate contamination using geospatial information such as proximity to nitrate sources, but previous models have not considered meteorological factors that change temporally. In this study, we test random forest (regression and classification) and linear regression models to predict nitrate contamination using rainfall, temperature, and readily available soil parameters. We trained and tested models for (1) all of North Carolina, (2) each geographic region in North Carolina, (3) a three-county region with a high density of animal agriculture, and (4) a three-county region with a low density of animal agriculture. All regression models had poor predictive performance (R-2 < 0.09). The random forest classification model for the coastal plain showed fair agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.23) when trying to predict whether contamination occurred. All other classification models had slight or poor predictive performance. Our results show that temporal changes in rainfall and temperature, or in combination with soil data, are not enough to predict nitrate contamination in most areas of North Carolina. The low level of contamination (<25%) measured during the study could have contributed to the poor performance of the models.

AB  - Soil characterization is essential for planning activities in urban areas in order to detect potential risks and understand the possible impacts derived from those activities. Nine soils located in Alicante (southeast of Spain) developed over construction debris were studied. Soil characteristics including mineralogy, elemental composition and metal availability were analyzed in two consecutive years, 2019 and 2020. These soils were similar to forest soils in the same area, with no evidence of asbestos clays or excess harmful elements. However, the use of DTPA extraction revealed high levels of Mn and Zn in some soils. Organic carbon and metals extracted with DTPA differed in 2019 and 2020, but no relationship between metal-DTPA and organic carbon content was observed. In general, organic matter content was higher in 2019, and elements extracted with DTPA were lower. The above-average rainfall in 2019 could have led to the washing away of dissolved materials and fine soil particles, decreasing elemental availability on the one hand, while promoting the development of natural vegetation, increasing soil organic matter, and immobilizing elements in living organisms on the other hand. The fact that the metal mobility varies depending on weather and soil characteristics is important when planning. Despite the demonstrated advantages of increasing urban green areas from an environmental and social point of view, we should not forget the materials on which urban soils are developed. Therefore, it is essential to establish annual plans for monitoring variations in the availability of heavy metals. This is of the most relevance when the plants are for human consumption. It is therefore also necessary to control the vegetables that grow on these soils and, in the event of possible problems, use the soil for gardening.

AB  - Plants are vital to human health and well-being, as well as helping to protect the environment against the negative impacts of climate change. They are an essential part of the 'One Health' strategy that seeks to balance and optimize the health of people, animals and the environment. Crucially, plants are central to nature-based solutions to climate mitigation, not least because soil carbon storage is an attractive strategy for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and the associated climate change. Agriculture depends on genetically pure, high-quality seeds that are free from pests and pathogens and contain a required degree of genetic purity. This themed collection addresses key questions in the field encompassing the biochemical mechanisms that underlie plant responses and adaptations to a changing climate. This collection encompasses an analysis of the biochemistry and molecular mechanisms underpinning crop and forest resilience, together with considerations of plant adaptations to climate change-associated stresses, including drought, floods and heatwaves, and the increased threats posed by pathogens and pests.

AB  - Animal distributions continue to undergo dramatic shifts in response to environmental change as many ecosystems become altered or transition away from their historic states. The North American Great Plains was historically a vast prairie ecosystem that has been heavily altered into a patchwork of remnant grasslands, industrial agriculture, and tracts invaded by woody vegetation. We studied the habitat selection of a forest-dwelling bird, the American Woodcock (Scolopax minor J. F. Gmelin, 1789), at the westward periphery of the species' range to determine how this species uses resources in this modified landscape. During the migratory and breeding season (March-May), woodcock tracked using GPS transmitters in Nebraska selected areas with higher proportions of young forest and forests with moist soils, exhibiting similar selection to birds occupying core areas of their range in eastern North America. During the summer, woodcock routinely used (46% of diurnal points) irrigated agricultural fields during the day, which was unexpected for a species that is known to summer in forest-dominated ecosystems. Our study provides evidence for flexible and atypical woodcock habitat selection at the edge of their range. These results add to the growing body of evidence pointing to regional shifts in avian community structure and further underscore the threats of conversion and encroachment to the Great Plains.

AB  - Five yeast strains isolated from tree bark and rotten wood collected in central and southwestern China, together with four Brazilian strains (three from soil and rotting wood collected in an Amazonian rainforest biome and one from Bromeliad collected in Alagoas state) and one Costa Rican strain isolated from a flower beetle, represent a new species closely related with Yueomyces sinensis in Saccharomycetaceae, as revealed by the 26S ribosomal RNA gene D1/D2 domain and the internal transcribed spacer region sequence analysis. The name Yueomyces silvicola sp. nov. is proposed for this new species with the holotype China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center 2.6469 (= Japan Collection of Microorganisms 34885). The new species exhibits a whole-genome average nucleotide identity value of 77.8% with Y. sinensis. The two Yueomyces species shared unique physiological characteristics of being unable to utilize ammonium and the majority of the amino acids, including glutamate and glutamine, as sole nitrogen sources. Among the 20 amino acids tested, only leucine and tyrosine can be utilized by the Yueomyces species. Genome sequence comparison showed that GAT1, which encodes a GATA family protein participating in transcriptional activation of nitrogen-catabolic genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is absent in the Yueomyces species. However, the failure of the Yueomyces species to utilize ammonium, glutamate, and glutamine, which are generally preferred nitrogen sources for microorganisms, implies that more complicated alterations in the central nitrogen metabolism pathway might occur in the genus Yueomyces.

AB  - The Mediterranean region is undergoing an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events, resulting in terrestrial runoffs that can affect aquatic environments in coastal regions. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of terrestrial runoff on natural coastal planktonic assemblages. For this purpose, an in situ mesocosm experiment was conducted in May 2021 in the Mediterranean Thau Lagoon. A terrestrial runoff event was simulated in duplicate mesocosms by adding natural forest soil that was left to maturate naturally for two weeks in river water. After the addition of maturated soil, the abundance and diversity within the planktonic food web, from viruses to metazooplankton, were monitored for 18 days. The addition of maturated soil to the terrestrial runoff treatment greatly depressed the light availability in the mesocosms and potentially enhanced flocculation and sedimentation in the mesocosms, resulting in an immediate negative effect on phytoplankton, decreasing the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration by 70% for 12 days. Afterward, remineralized nutrient in the terrestrial runoff treatment induced a subsequent positive effect on phytoplankton, which resulted in a diatom bloom and an increase in picophytoplankton and cyanobacteria abundance toward the end of the experiment. Overall, the Chl-a concentration was 30% lower in the terrestrial runoff treatment over the 18 days of experiment, whereas bacteria were 15% more abundant than in the control. This suggests that over the course of the experiment, the addition of maturated soil favoured bacteria instead of phytoplankton at the base of the planktonic food web. The addition of the maturated soil was detrimental for all protozooplankton groups and mixotrophic dinoflagellates, but seemed to favour metazooplankton, notably mollusk larvae, copepod nauplii, and rotifers. This implies that in the terrestrial runoff treatment, the preferential pathway for biomass transfer was through the direct consumption of bacteria and/or phytoplankton by metazooplankton. Therefore, in Thau Lagoon, after a terrestrial runoff, the transfer of biomass within the planktonic food web would potentially be more efficient by promoting direct transfer from the base to the top of the food web, subsiding intermediate trophic levels such as protozooplankton.

AB  - The integrated crop-livestock-forest (ICLF) system integrates different components of animal husbandry. The implementation of this system aims at sustainability, seeking to exploit the area as much as possible, in addition to reducing the impact on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of the soil. With technological advances and numerous variables, fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been used for data classification and estimation. This study aims to estimate the Marandu grass yield in integrated systems using the input, volume of rainfall, and experimental period. A performance of approximately 0.077 was observed for the mean square error (MSE), and the radial basis in estimation (RBR) network had an error of 0.255%, which is much lower than that of the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network and methodology based on fuzzy logic, with errors of 2.713 and 10.840%, respectively, between the obtained and expected output. This indicates that the quality of the grass was better with one or three eucalyptus lines in the ICLF system and demonstrates the application efficiency of the model with a tool for forecasting the Marandu grass yield in the studied soil and climate conditions.

AB  - This study focused on assessing the extent of pollution in both flowing and non-flowing surface water within the Matjhabeng mining area of South Africa, with particular emphasis on the substantial impact of gold mine tailings. A comprehensive analysis of physical water-quality attributes, including potentially toxic elements (PTEs), and relevant pollution risk indices was undertaken. To comprehensively elucidate the potential risks to aquatic organisms and human health, a risk assessment framework predicated upon the source-pathway-receptor model was developed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed as a multivariate statistical tool to discern the potential origins of PTE contamination within the environment. The results substantiate pronounced pollution manifestations within the surface water milieu of the Matjhabeng mining area. Specifically, concentrations of critical PTEs, such as arsenic, cobalt, copper, iron, selenium, and zinc, exhibited transgressions of the regulatory thresholds stipulated by both the South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) and the Canadian Council of the Ministers of the Environment (CCME). Additionally, concentrations of the aforementioned elements exceeded the stipulated DWAF guidelines for irrigation water usage. Pollution indices, encompassing the Single-Factor Pollution Index and the Nemerow Integrated Pollution Index, discerned moderate contamination stemming from As, while remarkably elevated pollution levels were identified for selenium. PCA elucidated 94.5% of the aggregate variance, revealing cobalt, copper, nickel, and zinc as coalescing within PC1, indicative of a common anthropogenic provenance that is conceivably linked to historical gold mine tailings. PC2 exhibited an aggregation of chromium, iron, and lead, reaffirming this shared anthropogenic etiology. The third PCA component was characterized by selenium, followed by arsenic and magnesium in the fourth. The resultant PTE contamination underscores a profound ecological and public health risk, impacting both the aquatic ecosystems and the local community within the precincts of the Matjhabeng Local Municipality (MLM) area, with consequential amplification of susceptibilities to deleterious health consequences. Urgent and concerted interventions are imperative to ameliorate the emergent decline in surface-water quality within the MLM locale. The adoption of nature-based remediation paradigms holds promise for efficaciously elevating water quality, ameliorating community health, and underpinning the long-term economic viability of the region.

AB  - Polycladus gayi is a colourful and easily recognizable land planarian native to the temperate to cold rainforests of the west coast of southern South America, in Chile and Argentina; however, its ecology is poorly understood. Here, we describe the first records of P. gayi preying on a black snail Macrocyclis peruvianus in the wild. Two events were recorded, the first in a healthy forest in Llancahue Alto, Panguipulli, Chile, during the austral summer of 2023, and the second in a mature evergreen forest in the coastal range of La Union, Chile. These records expand our knowledge of the feeding habits and behaviour of P. gayi and add M. peruvianus to its prey list.

AB  - As global climate conditions continue to change, disturbance regimes and environmental drivers will continue to shift, impacting global vegetation dynamics. Following a period of vegetation greening, there has been a progressive increase in remotely sensed vegetation browning globally. Given the many societal benefits that forests provide, it is critical that we understand vegetation dynamic alterations. Here, we review associative drivers, impacts, and feedbacks, revealing the complexity of browning. Concomitant increases in browning include the weakening of ecosystem services and functions and alterations to vegetation structure and species composition, as well as the development of potential positive climate change feedbacks. Also discussed are the current challenges in browning detection and understanding associated impacts and feedbacks. Finally, we outline recommended strategies.

AB  - Background: Saffron cultivation is vital in the Taliouine-Taznakht regions, but the influence of agricultural practices on soil nematode communities, critical for soil health and plant productivity, is not well understood. This study characterizes nematode communities in saffron fields of the Taliouine-Taznakht regions, assessing the impact of various agricultural practices on these communities, with a focus on their diversity, functional roles, and potential as bio-indicators of soil health. A total of 163 soil samples were collected from saffron fields in Taliouine-Taznakht. Nematode communities were identified, quantified, and their functional diversity analyzed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to visualize relationships between nematode communities and sampling sites. Co-inertia analysis assessed the impact of agricultural practices on nematode diversity. The nematode communities were diverse and varied across regions. PCA identified unique nematode community compositions in different saffron fields. Omnivorous nematodes were strongly linked with Taouyalte (TA), and herbivorous ones were prevalent at Agadir Melloul (AM) and Sidi Hssaine (SH). Modern crop types, highfrequency irrigation, and alfalfa-barley rotation were positively correlated with predator nematode abundance, potentially controlling plant parasitic nematodes and encouraging nutrient cycling. Conversely, monocropping, traditional irrigation, and long plantation age correlated with reduced structure and maturity indices, suggesting a less stable ecosystem. This study unveils the intricate relationships between nematode communities in Taliouine-Taznakht saffron fields and agricultural practices. Findings indicate that specific practices, such as crop rotation and modern irrigation techniques, can foster beneficial nematode groups that improve soil health and potentially regulate harmful plant parasitic nematodes. This knowledge is crucial for crafting sustainable and effective saffron cultivation strategies.

AB  - Pine wilt disease (PWD) is a highly destructive disease in forest ecosystems, resulting in extensive forest decline and substantial economic losses. As soil pH plays a critical role in soil microbial activity and significantly impacts the prevalence and severity of diseases, we conducted an experiment to regulate soil pH for alleviating PWD in a black pine (Pinus thunbergii) forest. The result reveals that: (1) The pH of the soil under a P. thunbergii forest was 5.19 +/- 0.40, which was significantly lower than that of soils under other vegetation types at 8.53 +/- 0.44. (2) Finely ground shell powder (F-SP) was the optimal size for long-term and efficient regulation, but quicklime (QL) exhibited the strongest efficacy in raising soil pH, followed by F-SP and plant ash. The regulation effect strengthened with the dosage amount. (3) In the situ experiments, part of symptomatic black pine in F-SP or QL plots were apparently improved and converted to asymptomatic trees separately by 15.9% and 5.4%. Applying F-SP can alleviate PWD in a sustainable way. This paper presents the first investigation to assess the effects of regulating soil pH for controlling PWD. It holds significant practical value for the rational planning and the sustainable development of artificial forests in coastal regions.

AB  - A high-quality feed base is a must to ensure the growing of numerous animals via selecting promising high-yielding crops that can provide livestock with feeds at the entire production stage. This study purposed to develop new technologies for reinstating a balanced use of pastures in Kazakhstan's steppe and forest-steppe zones. Several investigations succeeded in 2019-2022 at the Service-ZHARS Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) production fields of District Kyzylzhar, North Kazakhstan. Five chosen pasture combinations created multifactor pasture lands, as follows: common alfalfa + Festulolium; awnless brome + yellow sweet clover; common alfalfa + pasture ryegrass + Festulolium; white sweet clover + awnless brome + Timothy grass, and sainfoin + Festulolium + pasture ryegrass + Timothy grass. For haymaking and pasture chain construction, the following grass combinations selected comprised two-pasture grasses (previous years' brome and Timothy grass + common alfalfa + sainfoin) and seven hay grasses (vetch + oats, Sudan grass, sorghum-Sudan grass hybrid + sorghum, corn for silage, sorghum, peas + oats + barley + wheat, and peas). The use of drought-resistant legumes, cereals, and arable crops and their mixtures positively impacted intensifying the feed base and reducing the pasture areas' degradation. Thus, in the first experiment, the green mass collection was higher than 3.33 t ha-1, while in the second one, it was below 4.75 t ha-1, which fully bestowed the physiological needs of animals. The species diversity of pasture vegetation has improved because of beans' inclusion, possibly enhancing the protein ratio in green feed and hay as the main component of the farm animals' diet.

AB  - Why do some mature lodgepole pines survive mountain pine beetle outbreaks while most are killed? Here we test the hypothesis that mature trees growing in sites with vascular plant indicators of high relative soil moisture are more likely to survive mountain pine beetle outbreaks than mature trees associated with indicators of lower relative soil moisture. Working in the Clearwater Valley of south central British Columbia, we inventoried understory plants growing near large-diameter and small-diameter survivors and nonsurvivors of a mountain pine beetle outbreak in the mid-2000s. When key understory species were ranked according to their accepted soil moisture indicator value, a significant positive correlation was found between survivorship in large-diameter pine and inferred relative high soil moisture status-a finding consistent with the well-documented importance of soil moisture in the mobilization of defense compounds in lodgepole pine. We suggest that indicators of soil moisture may be useful in predicting the survival of large pine trees in future pine beetle outbreaks.

AB  - Radionuclides released and deposited because of the 2011 Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident caused an increase in air dose rates in Fukushima Prefecture forests. Although an increase in air dose rates during rainfall was previously reported, the air dose rates in the Fukushima forests decreased during rainfall. This study aimed to develop a method to estimate rainfall-related changes in air dose rates, even in the absence of soil moisture data, in Namie-Town and Kawauchi-Village, Futaba-gun, Fukushima Prefecture. Moreover, we examined the relationship between preceding rainfall (Rw) and soil moisture content. The air dose rate was estimated by calculating the Rw in Namie-Town from May to July 2020. We found that the air dose rates decreased with increasing soil moisture content. The soil moisture content was estimated from Rw by combining short-term and long-term effective rainfall using half-live values of 2 h and 7 d and considering the hysteresis of water absorption and drainage processes. Furthermore, the soil moisture content and air dose rate estimations showed a good agreement with coefficient of determination (R2) scores >0.70 and >0.65, respectively. The same method was tested to estimate the air dose rates in Kawauchi-Village from May to July 2019. At the Kawauchi site, variation in estimated value is relatively large due to the presence of water repellency in dry conditions, and the amount of 137Cs inventory was low, so estimating air dose from rainfall remained a challenge. In conclusion, rainfall data were successfully used to estimate soil moisture and air dose rates in areas with high 137Cs inventories. This leads to the possibility of removing the influence of rainfall on measured air dose rate data and could contribute to the improvement of methods currently used to estimate the external air dose rates for humans, animals, and terrestrial forest plants.

AB  - In the recent decades, Norway spruce forests (Picea abies Karst.) in Europe have been subject to large-scale tree mortality caused by the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). The outbreaks were induced by storm-felling events and periods of drought, which are becoming increasingly frequent due to climate change. Because storms and droughts spatially affect forests differently, the infestation patterns and configuration of the bark beetles might differ between storms and drought. In this study, we examined local and landscape factors associated with bark beetle-caused tree mortality after one storm (2005) and one drought-induced spruce bark beetle outbreak (2018), both occurring in southern Sweden. A total of 13,192 infested one-ha pixels after the storm and 6,425 one-ha pixels after the drought (in total 19,617) were compared regarding differences in infestation occurrence and size and associated forest structures and climate between the two different outbreaks, using a generalized linear model (GLM) approach. Based on our findings, we discovered that the allocation of infestation patch sizes (including four classes: 5-10, 11-25, 26-50 and >50 infested trees) for the two outbreaks were quite similar with a large proportion (>0.6) of small groups (& LE;10 trees). However, the outcomes from this study demonstrate that the drivers behind the spatial configuration of bark beetle infestations can differ considerably between outbreaks triggered by storms and droughts, and the main cause seems to be linked to the spatial distribution of susceptible trees. The most consistent differences for both occurrence and infestation size were that storm-induced infestations increased more with spruce volumes and area of protected forests (nature reserves) in the landscape; whereas for the drought-induced infestations, occurrence and size increased more with clear-cuts in the landscape and spruce heights across spatial scales. Soil moisture and mean drought index (SPEI; May-July) were important for both outbreaks, but generally more important for the infestation sizes after droughts than after storms and may involve a time-lagged effect. The reasoning behind the differences between storms and droughts may be that during storm-induced outbreaks, when the wind-felled trees are removed or not suitable anymore, bark beetles need to find specific susceptible standing trees, while after drought all trees are more or less stressed, which results in a selection of large trees in dry and warm landscapes as they have more resources and favorable reproduction conditions. Finally, we show that the previous infestation size influenced the later infestation size negatively within landscapes of 25 ha and this seems to be related to depletion of susceptible host trees. These results are important for the assessment of more specific outbreak predictions, which should be integrated in future risk mapping of bark beetle outbreaks.

AB  - Lianas are abundant and diverse organisms in tropical forests. Their increase is strongly associated with the occurrence of forest disturbances that affect forest dynamics in a negative way. Fire-induced disturbances are likely to increase in the scenario caused by climate change in which extreme droughts become more and more frequent due to the increase in the planet's average temperature. The objective was to answer the following questions: (i) What is the density and diversity of lianas in a fragment of semideciduous seasonal forest? (ii) Is there a difference in infestation (composition, density, diversity, and structure) of lianas in a disturbed area with and without forest fire occurrence? The study was carried out in a semideciduous forest fragment with (A1) and without (A2) occurrence of forest fire. The lianas, which were ascending to the canopy, were measured in a census-type inventory with a minimum inclusion diameter of 1.0 cm, 1.30 m from the main rooting point, with a precision digital tree caliper. Trees were also measured in a census-type inventory, with a minimum diameter at breast height (DBH) of 5.0 cm, using a tape measure. The height of all trees was measured with the Vertex & REG; device. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test of adherence, at 5% probability, was applied to check whether the diametric distribution of lianas differed statistically. Fire altered the species composition of lianas by 36%. The density of lianas increased after the forest fire occurred, by 65%. Fire altered the diametric distribution of lianescent individuals and acted as a homogenizing agent of species composition, removing sensitive species and increasing the abundance of species tolerant to it. The increase in density was favored by the light conditions provided by the opening of the canopy after the forest fire occurred. Fire altered the diametric distribution of the lianas which differed statistically by the K-S adherence test at 5% probability. Fire alters the species composition and structure of liana individuals, increases the density and decreases the diversity of lianas in a fragment of semideciduous seasonal forest with Araucaria angustifolia.& COPY; 2023 SAAB.

AB  - Each year temporary puddles are formed on compacted earth roads as a consequence of heavy rains and subsequent flooding in the large floodplain forests of the Danube River, Hungary, Central Europe, Hungary. After the receding of floodwaters, the muddy puddles persist from spring to mid-fall, where they are densely populated by Galba truncatula snails on an annual basis. These snails are the sole intermediate host of Fascioloides magna liver fluke of deer in the forest. According to field observations, G. truncatula is a very rare species on banks of river branches and lakes within the forest but always appears in large aggregations in these semi-natural potholes. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) leave their droppings in puddles while they wallow in the mud, therefore the snails encounter the miracidia of F. magna frequently. Snails are not able to dig themselves into the tamp soil of roads therefore they are destroyed by the wheels of vehicles which drive down the roads from autumn to the end of winter. Therefore, snails colonize these puddles regularly every spring. Since there is no connection between the distant puddles, it is supposed that deer and wild boars repeatedly introduce the snails into the puddles each year carrying snails with the help of mud, which is stuck on their fur while they wallow. This method of transport is supported by the fact that shell remnants of snails can be found on the bark of rubbing trunks situated nearby wallows. It seems that the sequential creation of wallow sites and the repeated introduction of G. truncatula enhance the likelihood for the trematode to infect both hosts.

AB  - In this study, a special rice-energy willow/poplar agroforestry system was used to analyze the effects of reused water irrigation and mulching on soil salinity, earthworm biomass and abundance, soil organic matter (SOM) content and weed coverage in treerow-dependent habitats. After three-year-irrigation, we investigated the woody line (WL), the buffer zone (BZ) and the crop line habitats (CL). Between 2019 and 2021, we collected data on the distribution of soil-specific electrical conductivity (EC), ammonium-lactate soluble sodium (AL-Na) and exchangeable cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) and soil NO2- + NO3--N contents from CL habitats irrigated with effluent water from an intensive catfish farm. Based on our results, significantly greater earthworm abundance (274 pc m(-2)) and earthworm biomass (54.0 g m(-2)) values were measured in WL than in BZ or CL habitats. There was no significant difference in weed coverage between the CL (0.61%) and BZ (1.91%), but weeds were significantly denser on the WL (12.3%). In the third year, the EC, AL-Na and ESP values were lower, but the SOM was higher in mulched soil (183.1 mS cm(-1), 253.1 mg kg(-1), 4.4 ESP% and 4.597%, respectively) than in un-mulched soil.

AB  - Sodium (Na) plays a critical role in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In Na-poor regions, plant consumers may experience Na deficiency and adapt by seeking supplementary Na resources. This can markedly impact animal behavior, space-use, and co-existence, with concomitant impacts on ecosystems. Many studies have noted that Na-seeking behaviors, such as soil consumption from mineral licks, are predominately observed for larger-bodied herbivores. However, the mechanisms that drive interspecific variation in Na deficiency and mineral lick use remain poorly understood. Here, we examine whether allometric scaling of Na requirements can explain variation in mineral lick use by herbivorous and omnivorous mammals. We 1) collated data from published literature to derive an allometric scaling of Na requirements in mammals, 2) compared predicted Na requirements to estimated Na intake of mammal communities in three globally distant sites: the Peruvian Amazon, Kalahari Desert, and Malaysian Borneo and 3) examined the relationship between predicted Na deficiency and mineral lick use utilizing camera-trap and mammal abundance data at each site. We found that minimum daily Na maintenance requirements in mammals scaled allometrically at a higher factor (BM0.91 (CI: 0.80-1.0)) than that of food and water Na intake (BM0.71-0.79), indicating that larger species may be more susceptible to Na limitation. This aligned with a positive association between mineral lick use and body mass (BM), as well as Na deficiency, by species at all sites, and increased artificial salt and mineral lick consumption by larger-bodied mammals in the Kalahari. Our results suggest that larger herbivores may be more sensitive to anthropogenic impacts to Na availability, which may alter their functional roles in ecosystems, particularly in Na-poor regions. Further research is needed to explore the consequences of changing Na availability on animals and ecosystems, as well as advance our understanding of Na physiology in mammals.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that wild animals can promote ecosystem carbon sinks through their impacts on vegetation and soils. However, livestock studies show that intense levels of grazing reduce soil organic carbon (SOC), leading to concerns that rewilding with large grazers may compromise ecosystem carbon storage. Furthermore, wild grazers can both limit and promote woody plant recruitment and survival on savanna grasslands, with both positive and negative impacts on SOC, depending on the rainfall and soil texture contexts. We used grazing lawns in one of the few African protected savannas that are still dominated by megagrazers (> 1000 kg), namely white rhinoceros Ceratotherium simum, as a model to study the impact of prolonged and intense wild grazing on SOC stocks. We contrasted SOC stocks between patches of varying grazing intensity and woody plant encroachment in sites across different rhino habitat types. We found no differences in SOC stocks between the most- and least grazed plots in any of the habitats. Intermediately grazed plots, however, had higher SOC stocks in the top 5 cm compared to most and least grazed plots, but only in the closed-canopy woodland habitat and not in the open habitats. Importantly, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that wild grazing reduces SOC, even at high grazing intensities by the world's largest megagrazer. Compared to the non-encroached reference plots, woody encroached plots had higher SOC stocks in soils with low clay content and lower SOC stocks in soils with high clay content, although only in the top 5 cm. Accordingly, our study highlights that wild grazers may influence SOC indirectly through their impact on tree-grass ratios in grassy ecosystems. Our study thus provides important insights for future natural climate solutions that focus on wild grazer conservation and restoration.Keywords: fire, grazing impact, rewilding, soil carbon, white rhinoceros, woody encroachment

AB  - Regeneration is crucial for forest continuity in natural and managed stands. Analyzing intra-annual dynamics can improve the understanding between growth and climate, identifying regeneration survival thresholds. The objective of this study was to determine the microclimate constraints (rainfall, air, and soil temperatures) of Nothofagus antarctica regeneration growth in closed, open, and edge forests in Southern Patagonia. We measured stand characteristics (forest structure, understory plants, soil properties, animal use), microclimate, and the daily growth of regeneration using dendrometers (n = 6) during two growing seasons. We found significant differences in the studied variables (e.g., overstory, light, soil, understory plants, animal use) in the following order: closed primary forests > open forests > edge forests with openlands. These changes defined the microclimate across the overstory gradient (e.g., soil moisture), influencing the daily growth of regeneration across the growing season (lag, exponential, stationary). Rainfall (the F factor varied from 6.93 to 21.03) influenced more than temperature (the F factor varied from 0.03 to 0.34). Daily growth in closed forests indicated shrinkage (-0.0082 mm day(-1) without rain and -0.0008 mm day(-1) with 0.0-0.2 mm day(-1) rainfall), while for more than 0.2 mm day(-1) of rainfall, growth always increased. Open forests presented shrinkage during days without rain (-0.0051 mm day(-1)), showing positive growth according to rainfall. Edge forests always presented positive daily growth. The resilience of regeneration under these changed conditions was directly related to the overstory. The main outputs indicated that regeneration was vulnerable during non-rainy days at the middle or closed overstory (>40% crown cover), suggesting the need for long-term monitoring to develop better silvicultural proposals.

AB  - Conservation agriculture, a sustainable farming practice combining no or minimum soil disturbance, crop diversification, and soil cover, can benefit humans and the biophysical environment. However, less than half of Sub-Saharan African countries implement conservation agriculture, and the majority of smallholder farmers are using unsustainable practices. Research and field trials on conservation agriculture adaptation to soil and ag-roecological conditions are vital for increasing adoption of conservation agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the change in soil chemical properties and soil biology from implementation of conservation agriculture, (ii) assess cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) yield and variability under conservation agriculture compared to the conventional farming practice, and (iii) evaluate differences in soil chemical properties, soil biology, and crop yields under conservation agriculture in savannah and forest ecosystems compared to conventional agriculture in smallholder farming in the province of Maniema in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Soils under conservation agriculture had 6.5 times more (p < 0.001) earthworms, 23% and 10% greater (p < 0.05) concentrations of soil phosphorus and potassium, respectively, and 100% greater (p < 0.001) cowpea yield than soils under conventional agriculture. Measured across all sites, conservation agriculture and conventional cowpea yields had coefficients of variation of 25% and 16%, respectively. This study showed for the first time that conservation agriculture implementation contributes to soil health and food security associated with smallholder farming in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

AB  - Tropical rainforests play an important role in the global Eco-climatic balance and its sustainable management is a major concern that has attracted the attention of researchers. The Luki biosphere reserve, while under a status of protected area, experiences anthropic pressures without spare. In order to control the activities of local populations and particularly to implement the principles of natural resources management enacted by the Man and Biosphere program of the United Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, a zoning plan has been implemented in the Luki biosphere reserve since 1979. The aim of this study was to evaluate the floristic composition, the diversity and structural parameters on floristic groupings of forest tree species in the Luki Biosphere Reserve (LBR) to evaluate whether the implemented zoning has an effect on plant diversity and population structure of forest trees species in the Luki Biosphere Reserve. Floristic data were collected on a set of 15 plots of 1 hectare (ha) each following the management zoning, in which tree species with diameter at breast height (dbh) >= 10 cm were measured and identified. Floristic diversity analysis was carried out and the relationship between within plots species richness and physical and chemical properties of soil was established. In total, 6497 individual trees were inventoried belonging to a total of 218 species grouped in 41 families making an average tree density of 433 +/- 13 individual per hectare. Two floristic groups emerged from the ordination of species and cluster analysis. Prioria balsamifera and Dialium pachyphyllum were among the most represented and characteristic tree species in the floristics groups. The families Sterculiaceae, Fabaceae, Ebenaceae, Olacaceae, Rubiaceae, Annonaceae, Myristicaceae, Meliaceae and Sapotaceae displayed high values of specific important index. Tree populations from the three zoning displayed an "inverted J" shape in an axil distribution of classes of diameters while the horizontal distribution of tree height displayed a bell structure. A significant difference exists in species richness among zones and floristic groupings. The floristics groupings were distributed following the soil texture. This work provides the basic elements for a sustainable management plan adapted with the current zoning plan in the Luki Biosphere Reserve.

AB  - Nematodes play an important role in ecosystems; however, very little is known about their assembly processes and the factors influencing them. We studied nematode communities in bulk soils from three Asian mountain ecosystems to determine the assembly processes of free-living nematode metacommunities and their driving factors. On each mountain, elevations span a range of climatic conditions with the potential to reveal assembly processes that predominate across multiple biomes. A phylogenetic null modeling framework was used to analyze 18S rRNA gene amplicons to quantify various assembly processes. We found that phylogenetic turnover between nematode communities on all mountains was dominated by stochastic processes, with "undominated processes" being the most predominant stochastic factor. Elevation has a significant impact on the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes. A variety of climatic and edaphic variables significantly influenced the variations in community assembly processes with elevation, even though their impacts were not consistent between the mountains. Overall, our results indicate that free-living nematode metacommunities in a wide range of environments are largely structured by stochastic processes rather than by niche-based deterministic processes, suggesting that metacommunities of soil free-living nematodes may respond to climate change in a largely unpredictable way.

AB  - IntroductionUnderstanding the adaptive capacity to current climate change of drought-sensitive tree species is mandatory, given their limited prospect of migration and adaptation as long-lived, sessile organisms. Knowledge about the molecular and eco-physiological mechanisms that control drought resilience is thus key, since water shortage appears as one of the main abiotic factors threatening forests ecosystems. However, our current background is scarce, especially in conifers, due to their huge and complex genomes. MethodsHere we investigated the eco-physiological and transcriptomic basis of drought response of the climate change-threatened conifer Cedrus atlantica. We studied C. atlantica seedlings from two locations with contrasting drought conditions to investigate a local adaptation. Seedlings were subjected to experimental drought conditions, and were monitored at immediate (24 hours) and extended (20 days) times. In addition, post-drought recovery was investigated, depicting two contrasting responses in both locations (drought resilient and non-resilient). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also studied to characterize the genomic basis of drought resilience and investigate a rapid local adaptation of C. atlantica. ResultsDe novo transcriptome assembly was performed for the first time in this species, providing differences in gene expression between the immediate and extended treatments, as well as among the post-drought recovery phenotypes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed a regulation of stomatal closing and photosynthetic activity during the immediate drought, consistent with an isohydric dynamic. During the extended drought, growth and flavonoid biosynthesis inhibition mechanisms prevailed, probably to increase root-to-shoot ratio and to limit the energy-intensive biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Drought sensitive individuals failed in metabolism and photosynthesis regulation under drought stress, and in limiting secondary metabolite production. Moreover, genomic differences (SNPs) were found between drought resilient and sensitive seedlings, and between the two studied locations, which were mostly related to transposable elements. DiscussionThis work provides novel insights into the transcriptomic basis of drought response of C. atlantica, a set of candidate genes mechanistically involved in its drought sensitivity and evidence of a rapid local adaptation. Our results may help guide conservation programs for this threatened conifer, contribute to advance drought-resilience research and shed light on trees' adaptive potential to current climate change.

AB  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in small watersheds depends on complex antecedent conditions that ultimately influence DOM generation, processing, and stability downstream. Here, we used ultrahigh resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and total dissolved nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon concentrations to investigate how DOM is produced in distinct sub-catchment types (poor fen, forested wetland, and upland forest) and transported through a watershed in the northeast Pacific coastal temperate rainforest (NPCTR). We traced a suite of previously identified source-specific marker formulae from vegetation and soil downstream and used them to test models of terrestrial DOM inputs. Marker formulae escaped microbial degradation and were exported from the watershed, demonstrating strong land-to-ocean connectivity through the transfer of unmodified tree DOM from specific tree species into the marine environment. Simple hydrologic and temperature variables were better able to predict inputs of soil-sourced DOM into the stream network than tree-sourced DOM, highlighting the role of antecedent conditions (e.g., plant growth stage) in DOM source availability and hydrologic flow connectivity, particularly for plant-derived material. Forested wetland pore waters featured thousands of nitrogen-containing molecular formulae that potentially provide a path of direct organic nitrogen uptake to organisms. The modified aromaticity index peaked in midsummer (up to 0.55 for fen headwaters) suggesting DOM inputs from freshly produced vegetation provide a strong summertime terrestrial signal. As the climate changes, new watershed-scale conditions may further complicate predictions of DOM source availability, flow connectivity, and downstream fate in NPCTR watersheds.

AB  - Over the past decades, the atmospheric CO2 concentration and global average temperature have been increasing, and this trend is projected to soon become more severe. This scenario of climate change intensifies abiotic stress factors (such as drought, flooding, salinity, and ultraviolet radiation) that threaten forest and associated eco-systems as well as crop production. These factors can negatively affect plant growth and development with a consequent reduction in plant biomass accumulation and yield, in addition to increasing plant susceptibility to biotic stresses. Recently, biostimulants have become a hotspot as an effective and sustainable alternative to alleviate the negative effects of stresses on plants. However, the majority of biostimulants have poor stability under environmental conditions, which leads to premature degradation, shortening their biological activity. To solve these bottlenecks, micro-and nano-based formulations containing biostimulant molecules and/or micro-organisms are gaining attention, as they demonstrate several advantages over their conventional formulations. In this review, we focus on the encapsulation of plant growth regulators and plant associative microorganisms as a strategy to boost their application for plant protection against abiotic stresses. We also address the potential limitations and challenges faced for the implementation of this technology, as well as possibilities regarding future research.

AB  - Orchidaceae (with > 28,000 orchid species) are one of the two largest plant families, with economically and ecologically important species, and occupy global and diverse niches with primary distribution in rainforests. Among orchids, 70% grow on other plants as epiphytes; epiphytes contribute up to similar to 50% of the plant diversity in rainforests and provide food and shelter for diverse animals and microbes, thereby contributing to the health of these ecosystems. Orchids account for over two-thirds of vascular epiphytes and provide an excellent model for studying evolution of epiphytism. Extensive phylogenetic studies of Orchidaceae and subgroups have ;been crucial for understanding relationships among many orchid lineages, although some uncertainties remain. For example, in the largest subfamily Epidendroideae with nearly all epiphytic orchids, relationships among some tribes and many subtribes are still controversial, hampering evolutionary analyses of epiphytism. Here we obtained 1,450 low-copy nuclear genes from 610 orchid species, including 431 with newly generated transcriptomes, and used them for the reconstruction of robust Orchidaceae phylogenetic trees with highly supported placements of tribes and subtribes. We also provide generally well-supported phylogenetic placements of 131 genera and 437 species that were not sampled by previous plastid and nuclear phylogenomic studies. Molecular clock analyses estimated the Orchidaceae origin at similar to 132 million years ago (Ma) and divergences of most subtribes from 52 to 29 Ma. Character reconstruction supports at least 14 parallel origins of epiphytism; one such origin was placed at the most recent common ancestor of similar to 95% of epiphytic orchids and linked to modern rainforests. Ten occurrences of rapid increase in the diversification rate were detected within Epidendroideae near and after the K-Pg boundary, contributing to similar to 80% of the Orchidaceae diversity. This study provides a robust and the largest family-wide Orchidaceae nuclear phylogenetic tree thus far and new insights into the evolution of epiphytism in vascular plants.

AB  - Vascular epiphytes represent c. 10% of all vascular plant species. In epiphytes, attachment is essential for survival throughout consecutive ontogenetic stages of their life, starting with: (1) initial propagule attachment to the host; followed by (2) the development of first root-substrate connections; and (3) maintenance of this attachment despite increased size and mechanical disturbances by rain, wind, or crossing animals. Although structural dependence on a host is a defining characteristic of an epiphyte, the fundamental mechanism(s) of how these plants initially attach and remain attached to their hosts remain poorly understood. Bark characteristics such as stability and roughness have been highlighted as keys to an understanding of this connection. Here, we stress that the understanding of how an epiphyte attaches itself to the substrate is central for a meaningful quantification and interpretation of bark roughness. Without explicit information on the attachment mechanism or the relative sizes of the attaching structures, simply linking a haphazardly chosen index of bark roughness to epiphyte establishment is flawed. This review introduces a conceptual framework to explain the mechanistic link between epiphytes and host in different ontogenetic stages and should guide future work designed to improve our understanding of this vital part of epiphyte ecology.

AB  - Increasing iron (Fe) concentrations have been reported for freshwaters across northern Europe over the last decades. This increase, together with elevated concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), leads to browning of freshwaters, which affects aquatic organisms, ecosystem functioning, biogeochemical cycles, and brings challenges to drinking water production. However, how such increasing trends in stream Fe concentrations reflect the contribution of different catchment sources remains poorly resolved. Here, we explored how catchment characteristics, that is, mires and coniferous soils, regulate spatial and temporal patterns of Fe in a boreal stream network. For this, we determined Fe speciation in riparian and mire soils, and studied temporal Fe dynamics in soil-water and stream-water over a span of 18 years. Positive Fe trends were found in the solution of the riparian soil, while no long-term trend was observed in the mire. These differences were reflected in stream-water, where three headwater streams dominated by coniferous cover also displayed positive Fe trends, whereas the mire dominated stream showed no trend. Surprisingly, the majority of higher order streams showed declining Fe trends, despite long-term increases in DOC. In addition, we found that an extreme drought event led to a prolonged release of Fe and DOC from the riparian soils, that could have long-term effects on stream Fe concentrations. Our results show that riparian forest soils can be major contributors to ongoing increases in freshwater Fe concentrations and that drought can further promote the release of Fe from organic soils.

AB  - Tropical forests are biologically diverse and structurally complex ecosystems that can store a large quantity of carbon and support a great variety of plant and animal species. However, tropical forest structure can vary dramatically within seemingly homogeneous landscapes due to subtle changes in topography, soil fertility, species composition and past disturbances. Although numerous studies have reported the effects of field-based stand structure attributes on aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests, the relative effects and contributions of UAV LiDAR-based canopy structure and ground-based stand structural attributes in shaping AGB remain unclear. Here, we hypothesize that mean top-of-canopy height (TCH) enhances AGB directly and indirectly via species richness and horizontal stand structural attributes, but these positive relationships are stronger at a larger spatial scale. We used a combined approach of field inventory and LiDAR-based remote sensing to explore how stand structural attributes (stem abundance, size variation and TCH) and tree species richness affect AGB along an elevational gradient in tropical forests at two spatial scales, i.e., 20 m x 20 m (small scale), and 50 m x 50 m (large scale) in southwest China. Specifically, we used structural equation models to test the proposed hypothesis. We found that TCH, stem size variation and abundance were strongly positively associated with AGB at both spatial scales, in addition to which increasing TCH led to greater AGB indirectly through increased stem size variation. Species richness had negative to negligible influences on AGB, but species richness increased with increasing stem abundance at both spatial scales. Our results suggest that light capture and use, modulated by stand structure, are key to promoting high AGB stocks in tropical forests. Thus, we argue that both horizontal and vertical stand structures are important for shaping AGB, but the relative contributions vary across spatial scales in tropical forests. Importantly, our results highlight the importance of including vertical forest stand attributes for predicting AGB and carbon sequestration that underpins human wellbeing.

AB  - Land degradation is one of the contemporary environmental challenges affecting regions inhabited by over one-third of the global population. In response to land degradation, restoration of degraded landscapes through area closure has been implemented through government and bilateral organizations for the last three decades in Ethiopia. Objectives of this study were to: i) explore the effects of landscape restoration on vegetation cover; ii) identify the perceived benefits to local communities; and 3) synthesize the lessons learnt on communities' willingness to sustain the restored landscapes. The study was conducted in project-supported restoration areas including the Dimitu and Kelisa watersheds representing the central rift valley dry lands and the Gola Gagura watershed representing the eastern dry land areas around Dire Dawa. The temporal changes in land use and land cover due to area closure integrated with physical and biological soil and water conservation measures were detected using GIS/Remote sensing techniques. Moreover, eighty-eight rural households were interviewed. The results of the study revealed that landscape restoration activities such as area closure integrated with physical soil and water conservation, and planting of trees and shrubs contributed to the significant changes in land covers of the watersheds in 3-5 years. Hence, barren lands were reduced by 35-100% while there were significant increases in forest lands (15%), woody grasslands (247-785%), and bushlands (78-140%). More than 90% of the respondents in the Dimitu and Gola Gagura watersheds verified that the landscape restoration activities improved vegetation cover and ecosystem services, reduced erosion, and increased incomes. A great majority of farm households (63-100%) expressed their willingness to contribute to different forms of landscape restoration interventions. Encroachment of livestock to closed area, shortage of finance, and the growing number of wild animals in closed area were the perceived challenges. Proper planning and implementation of integrated in-terventions, creating local watershed user associations, ensuring appropriate benefit-sharing and implementing innovative pathways to reconcile the tradeoffs could be considered to scale up interventions and address po-tential conflicts of interest.

AB  - Endozoochory, the dispersal of seeds by animal ingestion, is the most dominant mode of seed dispersal in tropical forests and is a key process shaping current and future forest dynamics. However, it remains largely unknown how endozoochory is associated with environmental conditions at regional and local scales. Here, we investigated the effects of elevation, climate, and microhabitat conditions on the proportion of endozoochorous plant species in the seed rain of the tropical Andes of southern Ecuador. Over 1 year, we measured seed rain in 162 seed traps on nine 1-ha forest plots located at 1000, 2000, and 3000 m a.s.l. We recorded climatic conditions (mean annual temperature and rainfall) in each plot and microhabitat conditions (leaf area index and soil moisture) adjacent to each seed trap. In total, we recorded 331,838 seeds belonging to 323 morphospecies. Overall, the proportion of endozoochorous species in the seed rain decreased with elevation. The relative biomass of endozoochorous species decreased with increasing rainfall, whereas the relative seed richness of endozoochorous species increased with increasing temperature and leaf area index. These findings suggest an interplay between climate factors and microhabitat conditions in shaping the importance of endozoochorous plant species in the seed rain of tropical montane forests. We conclude that changing climatic and microhabitat conditions are likely to cause changes in the dominant dispersal modes of plant communities which may trigger changes in the current and future dynamics of tropical forests.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms require resources in stoichiometrically balanced ratios of carbon (C) to nutrients, the demand for which links organismal and ecosystem-level biogeochemical cycles. In soils, the relative availability of C and nitrogen (N) also defines the strength of competition for ammonium between autotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophic decomposers, which may influence the coupled dynamics between N mineralization and nitrification. Here, we use data from the publicly available US National Science Foundation funded Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network to evaluate the influence of soil C concentration on the relationship between net nitrification and net N mineralization. We found that soil C availability constrains the fraction of mineralized N that is ultimately nitrified across the continental gradient, contributing to reduced rates of nitrification in soils with high C concentrations. Nitrate, which is produced by nitrification, is a highly mobile ion that easily leaches to aquatic ecosystems or denitrifies into the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Understanding the connection between soil C concentration and soil N transformations is thus important for managing potential ecosystem N losses, understanding the biogeochemical constraints of these losses, and accurately representing coupled C-N dynamics in ecosystem models.

AB  - Introduction. The aim of our research is to provide an overview of the role and challenges of precision agriculture, to examine the current situation, in particular its impact on sustainable food production. Materials and methods. The study is descriptive and used scientific secondary data as the primary source. The authors also conducted a primary research of farmers in Hungary in 2022 what they think about the role of precision farming. The primary research method is a questionnaire survey. Results and discussion. Precision farming is a management approach that focuses on ( near real-time) observation, measurement, and responses to variability in crops, fields and animals. Precision farming means the practical appearance of digitized agriculture, the use of digital solutions in agriculture, where developments are directed to how to manage in a more competitive way, to increase efficiency, while also placing great emphasis on environmental sustainability. Precision farming is increasingly used in agriculture today. The demand for agricultural products will grow dynamically over the next few decades, and this can be met by more efficient production. On the Internet, when we type the term of precision agriculture we will get 147 million search results. In our research, according to 81% of respondents, precision farming is very important. In recent years, the development of precision agricultural technology, mechanization and agricultural informatics has undergone significant development. More than half of the farmers use some kind of precision support system. Nearly 70 percent of respondents think that precision technology systems are too expensive. 31 percent of farmers would like to have more knowledge about precision technologies, mainly concerning productivity (yield, quality, etc.), plantation condition (plant growth status, soil analysis, etc.) and the distribution of inputs (irrigation water, organic fertilisers, fertilisers, etc.). More than half of the farmers think that policy makers in the industry (financial support, legal environment, etc.) should take action to make precision farming more accepted in practice and they think that it would also be important to deal with it more intensively in education. Farmers are open to precision solutions, but there are challenges to effective spreading. Conclusions. The competitive future of agriculture is influenced by digitalisation and the use of precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is becoming increasingly popular in practice, as it can make a major contribution to sustainable food production.

AB  - Intensive livestock management impacts forest and trees in different ways. Pig manure is a major source of nitrogen (N) pollution of surface and ground waters in some European regions such as north-eastern Spain, but it is understudied how manure application impacts agroforestry systems. How pig manure affects tree radial growth and the N cycle was assessed by measuring N concentrations in soil, leaves and wood and delta N-15 in tree-ring wood in two tree species widely planted for agricultural (Prunus dulcis) and reforestation (Pinus halepensis) purposes in the study area. Soil physicochemical characteristics and the biomass and structure of major soil microbial groups were also measured. Trees irrigated with pig effluent (manure application) and control trees not subjected to manure application were compared. Soil N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) concentrations of fertilized trees increased, but soil microbiota biomass decreased. Similar growth between fertilized and non-fertilized pine trees was found, but lower growth in fertilized almond trees was observed. Leaf N concentrations decreased but delta N-15 wood increased in trees subjected to pig manure application. Pig manure application alters the N cycling in the soil and within trees.

AB  - Context A significant forest decline has been noticed these last years in Europe. Managers need tools to better anticipate these massive events. Objectives We evaluated the efficiency of easily available data about environmental conditions and stand characteristics to determine different levels of vulnerability. Methods We combined remote sensing images, photo-interpretation, and digital models describing environmental conditions within a modelling approach to achieve spatial vulnerability assessment of the stands. We focused on silver fir and Norway spruce stands in the Vosges mountains (8900 km(2), northeastern France), where severe symptoms of decline are visible. Results Silver fir were predicted highly vulnerable on 7% of their area versus 33% for Norway spruce. Using an independent dataset, we observed ten-times (silver fir) and two-times (Norway spruce) higher mortality rates in the units with a high level of vulnerability than in the others. About half of the model deviance was directly or indirectly explained by variables related to water stress (soils displaying low water availability, having suffered severe drying events these last years). Furthermore, the stands acclimatised to drought conditions were more resilient. Stand characteristics also influenced dieback spread, suggesting that an evolution of silvicultural practices toward mixed stands with broadleaved species and uneven-aged trees can contribute to better adapt to future climate conditions. Conclusion Vulnerability maps based on easily available geographic information describing climate, soil, and topography can efficiently discriminate canopy mortality patterns over broad areas, and can be useful tools for managers to mitigate the effects of climate change on forests.

AB  - Chemical, physical, and microbial analysis of soil are one of the important study with chemical, physical, and microbial analysis, to indicate soil quality, safety, and healthy for plants, field animals, and humans. The numbers of soil microorganisms differ greatly; they are primarily helpful for the healthy growth and development of field flora, animals, and humans. The goal of this study is to assess soil quality irrigated with secondary-treated municipal wastewater during a 20-year period in Serapuim Forest, which is located in Egypt's Ismailia Governorate. The assessment will be based on a set of chemical, physical, and biological indicators. In this study, 36 soil samples (30-60 cm depth) were collected from 6 sites represented by the symbols: A, B, C, D, E, and P in the Serapuim Forest, Ismailia Governorate. The total samples were analyzed using standardized methods to eliminate multi-collinearity. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the dataset into new variables and estimate relative weights (Wi) and soil indicators (Si), which were then used to calculate the soil quality index (SQI). Principal component scores and assessments of soil characteristics were used to determine the soil quality for each area. On the other hand, several techniques to isolate and identify microbes have been described. The total microbial count and how many microorganisms are present in samples is one of the key indicators in the field of soil health. Because the count of microorganisms and their types should not exceed specific guidance values it is vital to keep track of the overall number of microbes and their types. In this study, the total count of microbes was estimated, in addition to identifying a number of pathogenic microbes. According to the results of SQI at the Serapuim Forest, the soil has a different SQI for each site, ranging from good to moderate to low. On another way, it is contaminated land, and this could adversely affect the fertility of the soil, and soil health.

AB  - More than half of the world's tropical lowland rainforests have been lost due to conversion to agricultural land (such as rubber plantations). Thus, ecological restoration in degraded tropical lowland rainforests is crucial. The first step to restoration is restoring soil functioning (i.e., soil fertility, carbon, and nitrogen cycling) to levels similar to those in the primary tropical lowland rainforest. This requires understanding soil nematode community assembly in primary tropical lowland rainforest, which has never been explored in this habitat. In this study, we measured species compositions of plant and soil nematode communities and soil characteristics (pH, total and available nitrogen, phosphorus, and soil water content) in a primary tropical lowland rainforest, which is located on Hainan Island, China. We performed two tests (the null-model test and distance-based Moran's eigenvector maps (MEM) and redundancy analysis-based variance partitioning) to quantify the relative contribution of the deterministic (abiotic filtering and biotic interactions) and stochastic processes (random processes and dispersal limitation) to the soil nematode community. We found that a deterministic process (habitat filtering) determined nematode community assembly in our tropical lowland rainforest. Moreover, soil properties, but not plant diversity, were the key determinants of nematode community assembly. We have, for the first time, managed to identify factors that contribute to the nematode community assembly in the tropical lowland rainforest. This quantified community assembly mechanism can guide future soil functioning recovery of the tropical lowland rainforest.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a collective name for thousands of synthetic compounds produced to enhance consumer and industrial products since the 1940s. They do not easily degrade, and some are known to pose serious ecological and human health concerns at trace concentrations (ng L-1 levels). Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances persist in treated wastewater and are inadvertently introduced into the environment when treated wastewater is reused as an irrigation source. The Pennsylvania State University (PSU) has been spray-irrigating its wastewater at a 2.45 km(2) mixed-use agricultural and forested site known as the "Living Filter" since the 1960s. To understand the spatiotemporal patterns of 20 PFAS at the Living Filter, water samples were collected bimonthly from fall 2019 through winter 2021 from the PSU's wastewater effluent and from each of the site's 13 monitoring wells. Crop tissue was collected at the time of harvest to assess PFAS presence in corn silage and tall fescue grown at the study site. Total measured PFAS concentrations in the monitoring wells ranged from nondectable to 155 ng L-1, with concentrations increasing with the direction of groundwater flow. Concentrations within each well exhibited little temporal variability across sampling events, with mixed relationships between PFAS and groundwater elevation observed between wells. Further, >84% of the PFAS present in livestock feed crops were short-chain compounds, with PFAS consumed annually by livestock fed crops harvested from the site estimated to be 2.46-7.67 mg animal(-1) yr(-1). This research provides insight into the potential impacts of long-term beneficial reuse of treated wastewater on groundwater and crop tissue quality.

AB  - Soil moisture use efficiency (SMUE) is an important indicator for evaluating the suitability of plant growth. This study synthetically assesses changes in SMUE in different vegetation types, fraction of vegetation cover, and altitude in the Asian drylands from 2001 to 2019. It also illustrates the inherent mechanisms by which soil moisture(SM) and net primary production (NPP), which are both affected by CO2 and relative humidity (f), influence SMUE. The results show an increase in SMUE over the study period, with annual mean values ranging from 0 to 0.59 (g C/mm). Forested areas have the highest SMUE value, while shrub land has the lowest value. These changes in SMUE are dominated by the three vegetation spatial combination patterns of NPP, SM, and the coupling relationship between NPP and SM. Forests and cropland are dominated by NPP, while wetlands, grassland and shrub land are dominated by SM. NPP is mainly affected by CO2 and the greenhouse effect, whereas SM is mainly affected by f.

AB  - Mineral licks, sites where animals go to consume soil, are key resources for herbivorous birds and mammals in the Amazon, providing supplemental dietary nutrients and toxin adsorption functions. However, because they are often difficult to find, the properties of mineral licks are poorly understood. Here, we undertake the largest survey of Amazonian mineral licks to date to determine the landscape, physical, and chemical properties of these critical sites. We used a generalized linear mixed-effects modeling framework to assess how soil samples from 83 mineral licks differ from nearby control soils in a series of physical and chemical characteristics, then used Jaccard's index of similarity and a principal component analysis (PCA) to determine how those samples differed among themselves. We found that mineral licks were generally located in specific ranges of landscape variables. Soils from mineral licks had elevated concentrations of almost all minerals measured. There was very little similarity between consumed and control samples, and within each sample type. We suggest that these mineral licks have the potential to provide multiple services to visiting species, demonstrating their ecological importance. The high levels of dissimilarity between samples indicate that a large sample of mineral licks is needed to draw conclusions in studies pertaining to geophagy. We emphasize that studying mammal and bird visitation at these sites could provide critical conservation and physiological information on cryptic and understudied species of Amazonian herbivores.

AB  - During the particularly severe hot summer drought in 2018, widespread premature leaf senescence was observed in several broadleaved tree species in Central Europe, particularly in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). For beech, it is yet unknown whether the drought evoked a decline towards tree mortality or whether trees can recover in the longer term. In this study, we monitored crown dieback, tree mortality and secondary drought damage symptoms in 963 initially live beech trees that exhibited either premature or normal leaf senescence in 2018 in three regions in northern Switzerland from 2018 to 2021. We related the observed damage to multiple climate- and stand-related parameters. Cumulative tree mortality continuously increased up to 7.2% and 1.3% in 2021 for trees with premature and normal leaf senescence in 2018, respectively. Mean crown dieback in surviving trees peaked at 29.2% in 2020 and 8.1% in 2019 for trees with premature and normal leaf senescence, respectively. Thereafter, trees showed first signs of recovery. Crown damage was more pronounced and recovery was slower for trees that showed premature leaf senescence in 2018, for trees growing on drier sites, and for larger trees. The presence of bleeding cankers peaked at 24.6% in 2019 and 10.7% in 2020 for trees with premature and normal leaf senescence, respectively. The presence of bark beetle holes peaked at 22.8% and 14.8% in 2021 for trees with premature and normal leaf senescence, respectively. Both secondary damage symptoms occurred more frequently in trees that had higher proportions of crown dieback and/or showed premature senescence in 2018. Our findings demonstrate context-specific differences in beech mortality and recovery reflecting the importance of regional and local climate and soil conditions. Adapting management to increase forest resilience is gaining importance, given the expected further beech decline on dry sites in northern Switzerland.

AB  - Study region: The eastern coast of New Caledonia (SW Pacific).Study focus: The HydroThiem hydrological observatory is devoted to the study of the impact of invasive ungulate species and bushfires on water resources, erosion and water quality in a catchment used for drinking water. It includes (1) three 100 m2 plots located on characteristic land surfaces, i.e. a woody savanna submitted to bushfires every few years, a healthy forest and a forest strongly degraded by deer and wild pigs, (2) two watersheds covering areas of 25 200 m2 and 3.1 km2. The first watershed includes mostly savanna while the second one is mostly constituted of humid forest. Available data include rainfall, soil moisture, discharge, and sus-pended matter concentration.New hydrological insight: Discharge and erosion rates exhibit striking differences between the three plots: the healthy forest presents a 3 % runoff and almost no erosion, the degraded forest being characterized by a 90 % runoff and large erosion, the savanna presenting intermediate values of runoff and erosion. The largest watershed present a 64 % runoff and an erosion rate amounting to 72 % of the one of the degraded plot. This emphasizes the role of subsurface flow and of gully erosion, respectively. Results from the Hydrothiem observatory can be used for a comparison with similar watersheds and may suggest guidelines for restoration and conservation strategies.

AB  - The food habits and behavior of medium and large-sized mammals that visited natural salt-licks in a tropical rainforest of Belum-Temengor Forest Complex, Peninsular Malaysia, were analyzed to understand the purpose of their salt-lick visits. The study was conducted at the wet-type salt-licks, where the animals drink clear water, thus the ingestion of clay particles needed for detoxification of plant secondary compounds, one of the possible purposes of salt-lick visits, seemed very low. Ten herbivorous, seven omnivorous, and four carnivorous species were recorded at the salt-licks. 95.3% of all video capture records of animals at the salt-licks were of herbivores, while the records of omnivores and carnivores were only 3.5% and 1.2%, respectively. These results indicated that herbivores visited studied salt-licks much more frequently than other food-habit species. The herbivores also tended to stay longer at the salt-licks than omnivores and carnivores. In addition, water-drinking behaviors were recorded significantly more frequently in herbivores (73% of video captures) than in omnivores (28%) and carnivores (0%). The carnivores showed only resting, passing, and hunting behaviors. The results suggest that the studied salt-licks were mainly used by herbivores and some omnivores, possibly to supplement minerals and/or alleviate gastrointestinal problems by drinking salt-lick water.

AB  - Strengthening of feed security in the Sahel is urgently needed given the climate change and growing human population. A prerequisite to this is sustainable use of rangeland forage resources for livestock. Many studies have focused on the assessment of rangeland resources during the rainy season, while only a few have focused on the dry season which is the longest and most demanding period for livestock in Sahelian rangelands. The objective of this study is to develop remote sensing-based models for estimating dry season forage vegetation mass. To that end, 29 vegetation indices calculated from each of the MODIS-MCD43A4 (500 m), Landsat-8 (30 m), and Sentinel-2 (10 m) satellite products were used and tested against in situ data collected during three field-measurement campaigns in 2021 at eleven monitoring sites across Senegalese rangelands. Four statistical models were tested, namely, random forest, gradient boosting machines, and simple linear and multiple linear regressions. The two main vegetation mass variables modeled from remote sensing imagery were the standing herbaceous and litter dry mass (BH) and total forage dry mass (BT) with a dry mass of woody plant leaves added to BH. Overall, Sentinel-2 data provided the best performance for the assessment of BH with multiple linear regression (R-2 = 0.74; RMSE = 378 kg DM/ha) using NDI5 (Normalized Difference Index5), GRCI (Green Residue Cover Index), SRI (Simple Ratio Index), TCARI (Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index), and DFI (Dead Fuel Index) indices. For BT, the best model was also obtained from Sentinel-2 data, including RVI3 (Ratio Vegetation Index3) (R-2 = 0.78; RMSE = 496 kg DM/ha). Results showed the suitability of combining the red, green, blue, NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 bands in monitoring forage availability during the dry season. Our study revealed that the spectral richness of the optical sensor systems Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, and MODIS-MCD43A4 allowed for accurate assessments of dry-season forage mass of semi-arid rangelands. Adding to this, the high spatial and temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery makes this a promising data source for timely monitoring. These findings can support the monitoring of the animal feed balance in Sahelian countries and contribute to enhancing the resilience of pastoralism toward feed shortage through early warning systems.

AB  - Dairy cows are motivated to access dry lying surfaces and will seek protection from wind and rain, but winter conditions may limit these opportunities when cows are managed outdoors. The primary aim of this observational study was to determine the effects of weather and paddock soil conditions on lying behavior of dairy cows managed outdoors during winter and fed crop in situ, a practice occurring in New Zealand with year-round grazing of dairy cows. A secondary aim was to characterize eating and ruminating behaviors during winter weather and paddock soil conditions. Four groups (99 nonlactating, pregnant cows each) were managed on 4 outdoor paddock areas on the same farm; the groups were fed pasture silage and grazed either kale (2 groups) or fodder beet (2 groups). Behaviors were recorded using validated leg-based (lying behavior) and ear-based (eating and ruminating time) accelerometers on 30 focal cows in each group over 32 d. Soil depth and wetness were scored daily at 25 points along 4 transects within each paddock area using recognized technical measures (penetrometer, soil volumetric water content), which were compared with practical tools for farmer use (ruler, moisture meter, percentage of sites in paddock scored as dry, wet, sodden, or with surface water pooling). Rainfall occurred most days during the study (mean 1.6 mm/d; maximum 12.2 mm/d), resulting in wet and muddy paddocks (mud depth with ruler: mean 6 cm, maximum 18 cm; paddock sites scored as wet or sodden: mean 34%, maximum 100%; paddock sites with surface water pooling: mean 27%, maximum 100%). Group lying time was 9.6 +/- 2.3 h/d (mean +/- standard deviation); however, 21% of cows consistently lay less than 8 h/d (to a minimum of 4.9 h/d). A mixed regression model tested the effects of daily weather and paddock soil conditions on daily lying time, with group as the observational unit, day as repeated measure, crop type as a fixed effect, crop type interactions with explanatory variables, and random intercepts of group and paddock within group. Lying time was less on the day of and day after rainfall (24 and 29 min/d less for 1 mm increase in rainfall, respectively). Two days after rainfall, lying time rebounded to about 1 h longer than before the rainfall. On the day after the heaviest rainfall event, group average lying time was only 2.5 +/- 1.9 h/d (mean +/- standard deviation); in 2 groups, 30% and 38% of cows, respectively, did not lie down at all for 24 h. Lying time decreased with deteriorating paddock soil conditions, especially with increasing surface water pooling, suggesting that this may be a useful measure to estimate the quality of the lying surface. Descriptively, ruminating time appeared to decrease with increased surface water pooling, possibly due to decreased lying time. Our results demonstrated that dairy cows could experience periods of short or no lying time during inclement weather and muddy paddock soil conditions. Prior rainfall and surface water pooling may be useful measures to determine if lying time, and thus animal welfare, are compromised.

AB  - As the climate changes there is a need to reduce the reliance on Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong) Carr.) in upland British forestry and increase species diversity to lower the risk of damage or loss of production due to biotic or abiotic events. An analysis of relevant species trials was carried out to assess the productivity of potential alternative conifer species on upland site types in Britain. Data from 87 forest experiments planted between 1929 and 1995 were analysed to compare long-term performance of 52 species with that of Sitka spruce under the same conditions and site type. Sites were broadly categorized using soil and climatic factors, which were used as primary factors in models predicting General Yield Class (GYC, the maximum mean annual increment in m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) of the potential alternative species and of Sitka spruce. No species had significantly higher GYC estimates than Sitka spruce, but grand fir (Abies grandis (Douglas ex D. Don) Lindl.), noble fir (Abies procera (Rehder)), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.), Lutz's spruce (Picea x lutzii (Little)), maritime pine (Pinus pinaster (Aiton)), Lawson cypress (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana (A. Murray bis) Parl.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris (L.)), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata (Donn ex D.Don)) all had GYC estimates which were not significantly lower than that of Sitka spruce under certain soil and climate conditions. A further 26 species, particularly Abies species, had GYC within 3 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) of Sitka spruce but were present on too few sites for inclusion in statistical models. The results of the analysis provide objective evidence for the planting of a wider range of species where Sitka spruce may currently be first choice. In the absence of any major pest or disease affecting Sitka spruce, it is still a good choice for many upland sites, however, a wider range of options with equivalent productivity exist, allowing forest managers to diversify and reduce the risk of damage or loss of production due to biotic or abiotic events.

AB  - Climate change is estimated to increase the risk of the bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) mass outbreaks in Norway Spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst) forests. Habitats that are thermally suitable for bark beetles may expand, and an increase in the frequency and intensity of droughts can promote drought stress on host trees. Drought affects tree vigor and in unison with environmental features it influences the local predisposition risk of forest stands to bark beetle attacks. We aimed to study how various environmental features influence the risk of bark beetle attacks during a drought year and the following years with more normal weather conditions but with higher bark beetle populations. We included features representing local forest stand attributes, topography, soil type and wetness, the proximity of clear-cuts and previous bark beetle attacks, and a machine learning algorithm (random forest) was applied to study the variation of predisposition risk across a 48,600 km2 study area in SE Sweden.Forest stands with increased risk of bark beetle attack were distinguished with high accuracy both during drought and in normal weather conditions. The results show that during both study periods, spruce and mixed coniferous forests had elevated risk of attack, while forests with a mix of deciduous and coniferous trees had a lower risk. Forests with high average canopy height were strongly predisposed to bark beetle attacks. However, during the drought year risk was more similar between stands with lower and higher canopy height, suggesting that during drought periods younger trees can be predisposed to bark beetle attacks. The importance of soil moisture and position within the local landscape were highlighted as important features during the drought year. Identifying areas with increased risk, supported by information on how environmental features control the predisposition risk during drought, could aid adaptation strategies and forest management intervention efforts. We conclude that geospatial data and machine learning have the potential to further support the digitalization of the forest industry, facilitating development of methods capable to quantify importance and dynamics of envi-ronmental features controlling the risk in local context. Corresponding methods could help to direct management actions more effectively and offer information for decision-making in changing climate.

AB  - Several time-series analyses have demonstrated that after extreme summer drought bark beetle damage increased. However, studies predicting stand susceptibility over large spatial extents are limited by technical constraints in obtaining detailed, spatially-explicit data on infestation spot occurrence. Using a unique dataset of georeferenced bark beetle infestation data, we tested whether the spatial variation of local growing conditions of forest stands, topography, and landscape variables modified the local occurrence of Ips typographus infestations after a severe hot drought in Central Europe. Bark beetle infestation occurrence depended on soil-related aridity intensity, elevation, slope, and soil conditions. We showed that elevation interacted with growing conditions and topography. At low elevations, spruce forests growing on flat areas and wetter soils were more sensitive to the infestations. On the contrary, forests on steep slopes and soils with low water availability were rarely attacked. At the landscape scale, bark beetle damage increased with host tree cover but decreased with compositional diversity. Our findings are generally consistent with the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis that predicts that trees growing under chronic dry conditions tend to be more resistant against biotic disturbances. Spruce stands at low elevations located in homogeneous landscapes dominated by spruce were those more exposed to bark beetles in the initial phase of a drought-induced outbreak.

AB  - Ensuring the effectiveness of method in maintaining and recovering the productive capacity of degraded soils, e.g., no-till farming, is more important than opening new agricultural frontiers. Organic matter breakdown is a key ecosystem process with implications on aquatic food webs and biogeochemical cycles. Our objective was to quantify the standard cellulosic substrate (cotton strips and balsa wood) mass loss in no-till soybean and forest areas as control. We use bags of two mesh sizes (0.5 mm vs. 10 mm), on soil surface and buried-in-soil (10 cm) for 30, 70, and 90 days in all three sampling sites: no-till soybean vs. adjacent forest vs. forest native. The invertebrate community by pitfall collector and soil for chemical characterization was also sampled. The high microbial breakdown of balsa wood buried-in-soil was observed in no-till soybean systems (+/- 5% compared to forest), indicating a superficial fertilizing effect and negative effect to decomposers. The mass loss in balsa wood in soil surface ranges from 15% (fine mesh in the adjacent forest) to 25% smaller (fine mesh in no-till soybean systems) compared to forest native. Microbial breakdown in cotton buried was 45% greater in no-till soybean systems compared to forest native. The cotton breakdown by invertebrate activity on soil surface was higher in the forest areas compared to no-till soybean (30% smaller) due to the quality and edaphic conditions of the adjacent litter. Finally, adjacent forest close to crops may provide important ecosystem services for productive systems.

AB  - Bioturbation by digging animals is important for key forest ecosystem processes such as soil turnover, decomposition, nutrient cycling, water infiltration, seedling recruitment, and fungal dispersal. Despite their widespread geographic range, little is known about the role of the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) in forest ecosystems. We measured the density and size of echidna diggings in the Northern Jarrah Forest, south-western Australia, to quantify the contribution echidna make to soil turnover. We recorded an overall density of 298 echidna diggings per hectare, 21% of which were estimated to be less than I month old. The average size of digs was 50 +/- 25 mm in depth and 160 +/- 61 mm in length. After taking into account seasonal digging rates, we estimated that echidnas turn over 1.23 tonnes of soil ha(-1) year(-1) in this forest, representing an important role in ecosystem dynamics. Our work contributes to the growing body of evidence quantifying the role of these digging animals as critical ecosystem engineers. Given that the echidna is the only Australian digging mammal not severely impacted by population decline or range reduction, its functional contribution to health and resilience of forest ecosystems is increasingly important due to the functional loss of most Australian digging mammals.

AB  - Leptospermum sp. with dihydroxyacetone in their nectar are a source of high-value medicinal honey production and can provide income from agriculturally marginal lands. The current study was from two newly planted Leptospermum nitens sites, one with duplex soil and the other in deep sandy soil, in the low rainfall areas of the south-west of Western Australia, with the aim of identifying key soil parameters influencing the plantation's survival and growth. Electromagnetic induction (EMI) at different depths was used to investigate the possible impact of soil variability on the Leptospermum nitens plantations. Two EMI surveys were conducted at each site, at different times of the year, to account for soil moisture variability (relatively dry and wet conditions). A least-square inversion algorithm was used to determine true electrical conductivities at three different soil depths (0-0.5, 0.5-0.8, and 0.8-1.6 m) to produce quasi-3D maps of soil inverted electrical conductivity. Corresponding soil samples from each depth were used for the physico-chemical analysis of soil parameters and to develop laboratory-based electrical resistivity to soil volumetric moisture calibrations with R-2 values between 0.95 and 0.99. Shrub survival and growth (canopy diameter) were estimated using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and machine learning. Comparing EMI soil mapping with UAV imagery results showed significantly greater shrub survival and growth (p < 0.001) in areas with higher ECa ranges of 12-24 mS m(-1) at the variable textured site and 6-9 mS m(-1) at the uniformly sandy site. Overall, the variable textured site, with an 82% survival rate, had a significantly higher shrub count and larger plants than the uniformly sandy site, with a 75% survival rate. A principal component analysis (PCA) identified inverted EC to be strongly correlated with soil moisture > pH > soil texture. Such soil mapping may be a robust and effective method for risk assessment of new shrub plantations.

AB  - Mountain forests are more prone to environmental predispositions (EPs) than submountain ones. While remote sensing of mountain forests enables instantaneous damage mapping, the investigation of the causes requires field data. However, a local field or regionally modeled environmental characteristics influence remote data evaluation differently. This study focused on the evaluation of EPs effects damaging mountain forests between various spatial resolutions during environmental change. The evaluation was divided into managed and natural forests in the HrubATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE Jesenik Mts. (Czech Republic; 240-1491 m a.s.l.; 50.082 degrees N, 17.231 degrees E). Damage was assessed through the discrimination analysis of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) by MODIS VI during alternating drought and flood periods 2003-2014. The local environmental influence was assessed using the discrimination function (DF) separability of forest damage in the training sets. The regional influence was assessed through map algebra estimated via the DF and a forest decline spatial model based on EPs from differences between risk growth conditions and biomass fuzzy sets. Management, EPs and soil influenced forest NDVI at different levels. The management afflicted the NDVI more than the EPs. The EPs afflicted the NDVI more than the soil groups. Strong winters and droughts had a greater influence on the NDVI than the flood events, with the winter of 2005/2006 inverting the DF direction, and the 2003 drought increasing differences in managed forest biomass and decreasing differences in natural forest biomasses. More than 50% of declining managed forests in the training sets occurred on Leptosols, Podzols and Histosols. On a regional scale, the soil influence was eliminated by multiple predispositions. The EPs influenced 96% of natural forest and 65% of managed forest, though managed forest damage was more evident. The mountain forest NDVI decline was dependent on both management and risk predispositions.

AB  - The current increase of severe droughts associated with climate change is one of the main causes of the observed dieback in Mediterranean holm-oak (Quercus Ilex subs ballota) forests. Effects of forest dieback in soils are greatly variable and depend on a number of local factors, but generally include increased soil organic C due to increased litter inputs, alterations in soil nutrient contents, changes in the nitrogen cycle, and detrimental effects on soil microbial communities and their functioning. There is little evidence, however, of the effects of forest dieback on soil faunal diversity. In this study, we assessed the effects of holm-oak dieback and induced nutrient shifts on soil microfaunal communities and their relationships with soil properties and functioning. We studied 13 Holm oak forest sites affected by tree dieback in the Iberian Peninsula and assessed the relationship between soil properties, microbial functions, and nematode diversity under healthy, defoliated, and dead trees at each site. We found that nematode abundances were variable and significantly patchy across sites. Bacterivore and herbivore nematodes were the most abundant nematode trophic groups. Nematode abundance increased with increasing levels of soil C only if soil P was available, indicating that nematode abundances might be P-limited in these semi-arid sys-tems. Bacterivore nematodes were especially affected by tree death, since tree dieback switched the relationship between bacterivore abundance and soil nutrient contents. Opportunistic bacterivores, able to exploit ephemeral bacterial resources blooming after soil organic enrichment, seemed more resilient to tree death than generalist ones, while fungivores did not clearly respond to forest dieback. We found complex and unexpected effects of tree dieback on soil microfaunal communities, which should receive further attention.

AB  - Nutrient pollution from farm fertilizers and manure is a global concern. Excess nitrogen and phosphorous has been linked to algal blooms and a host of other water quality issues. In the U.S., most animal production occurs in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) housing a significant number of animals in a confined space. CAFOs tend to cluster in space and thus generate large quantities of manures within a small area. Liquid manure from CAFOs is often stored in open-air lagoons and then applied via irrigation to crops on nearby 'sprayfields'. The full scope and extent of CAFO impacts remain unclear because of the paucity of public information regarding animal numbers, barn and lagoon locations, and manure management practices. Where and when manure is applied on the landscape is key missing data that is needed to better understand and mitigate consequences of CAFO management practices. The aim of this study was to detect land applications of liquid manure using a remote sensing approach. We used random forest models incorporating C-Band synthetic-aperture radar, multispectral imagery, and other predictors to examine soil moisture conditions indicating probable liquid manure applications across known sprayfields in eastern North Carolina. Our models successfully distinguished saturated and unsaturated soils within corn, soybean, grassland, and 'other' crops, with 93-98% accuracy against validation for clear weather periods during the dormant, early, and late growing seasons. A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed that the mean soil saturation frequency was significantly higher on sprayfields than non-sprayfields of the same crop type (p < 2.2e-16). We also found that manure applications were concentrated within similar to 1 km from the point of generation. This is the first application of satellite-based radar for identifying the location and timing of manure applications over broad areas. Future work can build on these methods to further understand manure management at CAFOs, as well as to improve pollution source tracking and modeling.

AB  - Termite mounds have been poorly studied in tropical rainforest in contrast to those of savannahs where they create fertility hotspots and influence the spatial pattern of vegetation. An inventory of termite mounds and of 15 tree species with a diameter at breast height >= 10 cm was carried out in two 800-ha blocks, in two rainforest sites located in northern Congo. We used inhomogeneous and intertype K functions to study the spatial pattern of termite mounds and of tree species around mounds, respectively. We found that mounds in Loundoungou were over-dispersed within a radius of less than 70 m, while those in Mokabi were randomly spaced. Tree species within a 20-m radius around a mound were aggregated towards the mound, e.g. Entandrophragma cylindricum, randomly distributed, or even repulsed by the mound. The specific responses also differed in the two sites. These results suggest that (i) the mounds in Loundoungou were created by savannah termite species 3,000-2,000 years BP during the Late Holocene Rainforest Crisis and (ii) the mounds in Mokabi are characteristic of forest mounds. The impact of termite mounds on the spatial pattern of tree species is thus site-dependent, and these differences might be due to species seed dispersal strategies and to soil calcium concentrations.

AB  - The community composition and activity-density of termites can influence nutrient cycling and other ecological functions. However, the spatial distribution and the activity-density of termites on a fine-scale in tropical forests are still unknown. We checked the spatial distribution patterns of the feeding groups and species of termites and their co-occurrence pattern in a 1-ha (100 m x 100 m) plot, and their correlation with the environmental factors. We used a standard protocol to collect termite assemblages and classified them into five feeding groups based on their preferred diet: fungus growers, litter feeders, soil feeders, soil-wood feeders, and wood feeders. We measured the environmental factors: soil pH, litter mass, aboveground plant biomass, and topographic position index (TPI). Soil-wood feeders showed the highest activity-density, followed by wood feeders, fungus growers, soil feeders, and litter feeders. Soil-wood feeders and fungus growers demonstated a strong correlation while litter feeders showed weak correlations with other feeding groups. Termite feeding groups and most of the termite species displayed a positive association with the high TPI and the low soil pH patches. Our results indicated that the examined environmental factors influenced the termite community assemblages and distribution patterns on a fine-scale in tropical rainforests.

AB  - Active forest management is applied in many parts of the western United States to reduce wildfire severity, mitigate vulnerability to drought and bark beetle mortality, and more recently, to increase snow retention and late-season streamflow. A rapidly warming climate accelerates the need for these restorative treatments, but the treatment priority among forest patches varies considerably. We simulated four treatment scenarios across the 3,450 km(2) Wenatchee River basin in eastern Washington, United States. We used a decision support tool (DST) to assess trade-offs and synergies within and among treatments on wildfire risk and smoke emissions, water yield and snow retention, biomass production, and economic return. Treatment scenarios emphasized prescribed burning (BurnOnly), biomass production (MaxBiomass), gap-based thinning to optimize water yield (IdealWater), and a principle-based restoration scenario (RA1). Fire hazard, smoke emissions, and biomass production metrics were evaluated across scenarios using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, and water yields were modeled using the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model. Simulations were summarized to both patch- (10(1)-10(2) ha) and subwatershed- (10(3)-10(4) ha) scales, and treatment effects were evaluated against an untreated baseline landscape. We used logic models to rank effect sizes by scenario across metrics along a continuum between -1 (no or weak effect) to +1 (large effect). All treatments produced benefits across one or more ecosystem services and led to synergistic benefits to water yield and wildfire hazard reduction. Tradeoffs among resource benefits were clear in wilderness where reliance on prescribed burning without mechanical treatment increased costs and eliminated the potential for biomass recovery. The BurnOnly scenario improved fire risk metrics and streamflow, but effect sizes were lower compared to other treatments. IdealWater showed the strongest benefits overall, demonstrating the ability to capture multiple resource benefits through spatially explicit thinning. Our study provides a framework for integrating strategic and tactical models that evaluate tradeoffs and synergies gained through varied management approaches. We demonstrate the utility of decision support modeling to enhance management synergies across large landscapes.

AB  - Plants are often dispersal limited relying on passive or active agents to find suitable microhabitats for germination. Seeds of pioneer tree species, for example, require light gaps for growth but have short median dispersal distances and often do not provide a food reward to encourage animal dispersal. Zanthoxylum ekmanii seeds are frequently moved by ants but evaluating the effectiveness of ant-mediated seed removal requires knowledge of the species moving the seeds, how far they are moved, and the deposition site. To assess the effectiveness of ants as seed dispersers of Z. ekmanii, we utilized the seed dispersal effectiveness framework. We tracked the movement of seeds from caches on the forest floor, revealing that foragers of Ectatomma ruidum moved 32.8% of seeds an average first distance of 99.8 cm with 68.3% of those seeds taken into a colony. The quality of deposition location was assessed using a seedling emergence study where freshly germinated seeds were buried at different depths. Seedlings were primarily able to emerge from the shallowest depths. Wax castings of E. ruidum colonies demonstrated that seeds brought into the colony were deposited in chambers that had larvae present and experienced more damage than seeds unhandled by ants. Foragers, however, did not have a strong enough bite force to rupture Z. ekmanii seeds likely because their muscle morphology is not structured to maximize force generation. Overall, E. ruidum may help fine tune deposition location, incorporating seeds into the topsoil, though few seeds will likely emerge if soil bioturbation is low.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an essential element for plant cultivation, where the demand for agricultural products as food and feed are the main drivers of aggravated agricultural production systems. Maize is one of the main feedstocks for animal feed production in Thailand. Therefore, this study investigated P flows, using the conservation of mass-balanced concept to identify the major P flows in maize cultivation during rainy and dry seasons based on a survey of 131 plantation land plots. The result indicated that total amount of P input to maize fields during upland rainy and lowland dry season cultivation was determined as 27.76 and 34.96 kg P/ha, respectively, approximately 97% of which was in chemical fertilizers. P output in grain products accounted for 31.7 and 37.3% of the total P input or 32.9 and 38.0% of the applied fertilizer during maize cultivation in rainy and dry seasons, respectively. Agricultural soils were the main stock of P in maize cultivation systems. From the amount of applied P in rainy and dry seasons of maize cultivation, 43.9 and 41.3% remained in the soil, respectively, whereas 6.0 and 4.5% of those input during rainy and dry season were lost through runoff to the hydrosphere, respectively. This result indicated that seasonal and geographical factors may affect P flow pattern in maize cultivation. This revealed that P accumulation in soils and P loss occurring in rainy season were greater than those of dry season. Therefore, optimizing P flows through improved nutrient management should carefully consider helping reduce P loss during maize cultivation in Thailand.

AB  - Context. There are multiple reports of high annual cow mortality rates in northern Australia, but no reports clearly indicating the overall rates and the impact of primary risk factors.
   Aims. The research aimed to determine which measured region-, property-, management group- and animal-level risk factors are associated with missing pregnant females.
   Methods. Risk factors for the annual rate of pregnant-cow mortality were investigated in an epidemiological study using outcomes for 21 554 cows from 52 beef herds in 2009 and 2010 in four primary country types within the mostly-dry tropical north Australian environment. Modelling of 2001-2011 Australian beef-herd statistics was used to corroborate and further quantify findings.
   Key results. In the epidemiological study, the overall predicted annual mean incidence of missing pregnant cows, a surrogate for mortality, was 10.9%, including lost tags and unrecorded cow movement that were estimated to constitute up to 9% missing cows. Risk factors associated with higher pregnant-cow mortality were as follows: not having follow-up rainfall more than 30 days after the first wet-season storms (4 percentage point increase); <2 t/ha of available pasture biomass in the early dry season (2-6 percentage point increase); pasture dry-season biomass <2 t/ha interacting with less than moderate mid-dry-season body condition score (3-10 percentage point increase); and, calving between April and September (non-significant trend for a 1-2 percentage point increase). Feed-quality measures did not affect mortality rate. Population modelling of Australian beef herd statistics suggested an average annual cow mortality rate in the Northern Forest region of similar to 7% compared with 2% in more nutritionally endowed regions.
   Conclusions. The major risk factor for cow mortality is under-nutrition, related either to generally-low soil fertility, seasonally-dry conditions, or management that exposes animals to poor nutrition. Annual mortality of pregnant cows appears 6-9 percentage points higher in the low-fertility Northern Forest region than elsewhere.
   Implications. Beef cow mortality is a major business cost in northern Australia. The efficacy of targeted management to achieve high cow performance was demonstrated by losses in a third of studied businesses in the Northern Forest being kept to the same or lower levels as median loss in endowed regions.

AB  - Micronutrient deficiencies are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries worldwide. Climate change, characterized by increasing global surface temperatures and alterations in rainfall, has the capacity to affect the quality and accessibility of micronutrient-rich foods. The goals of this review are to summarize the potential effects of climate change and its consequences on agricultural yield and micronutrient quality, primarily zinc, iron, and vitamin A, of plant foods and upon the availability of animal foods, to discuss the implications for micronutrient deficiencies in the future, and to present possible mitigation and adaptive strategies. In general, the combination of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and rising temperature is predicted to reduce the overall yield of major staple crops, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, more than altering their micronutrient content. Crop yield is also reduced by elevated ground-level ozone and increased extreme weather events. Pollinator loss is expected to reduce the yield of many pollinator-dependent crops such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. Sea-level rise resulting from melting of ice sheets and glaciers is predicted to result in coastal inundation, salt intrusion, and loss of coral reefs and mangrove forests, with an adverse impact upon coastal rice production and coastal fisheries. Global ocean fisheries catch is predicted to decline because of ocean warming and declining oxygen. Freshwater warming is also expected to alter ecosystems and reduce inland fisheries catch. In addition to limiting greenhouse gas production, adaptive strategies include postharvest fortification of foods; micronutrient supplementation; biofortification of staple crops with zinc and iron; plant breeding or genetic approaches to increase zinc, iron, and provitamin A carotenoid content of plant foods; and developing staple crops that are tolerant of abiotic stressors such as elevated carbon dioxide, elevated temperature, and increased soil salinity.
   Statement of Significance: This comprehensive review shows that climate change and its consequences are likely to affect micronutrient malnutrition by limiting the availability of micronutrient-rich plant and animal foods rather than their micronutrient content. Various mitigating and adaptive strategies should be considered to reduce the risk of micronutrient malnutrition in vulnerable populations in the face of climate change.

AB  - The United Nations estimates the rate of deforestation over 10 million hectares per year, with additional infested wood available due to drought, bark beetle calamity and other damage vectors. Processing the hard-to-reach infested wood into biochar via mobile pyrolysis units seems to be a good option for fire prevention. However, since most biochar is currently produced mainly from biological waste, there is not enough experience with wood biochar on a large scale. Review of current knowledge, followed by techno-economic assessment reveals that following the chemical composition of the feedstock, wood biochar outperforms other types of biochar in terms of high porosity. Therefore, wood biochar shows excellent results in increasing the amount of plant-available water content in soil and appears to be an excellent tool for recycling nutrients (especially into plant available forms of phosphorus and nitrogen). The overall positive effects of biochar application change from abiotic to biotic over time because as it decays, many of its physical properties disappear, but it can boost soil microbial communities on which soil fertility depends. As global climate change creates a wide range of factors that damage forest cover, wood biochar consequently represents untapped potential in the field of soil, nutrient, and energy management.

AB  - We analysed the pollen composition, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs) and stable carbon isotope data (delta C-13 values) of surface sediments (soil), from the proglacial deposits (outwash plain and the two levels of kame-terraces) of the Chorabari Glacier, Kedarnath, India. The main objective was to develop the modern-proxy an-alogues, for the calibration of fossil records, for use in palaeoclimatic reconstructions. The pollen-vegetation relation is incompatible (non-linear) with the present vegetation, as the pollen assemblages are marked by the prolific over-representation of extra-local pollen, especially Pinus, over the local herbaceous taxa. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the palynological data to ascertain the major groups of pollen in relation to the vegetation types and reveal variations in the pollen records between the kame-terraces and the outwash plain. delta C-13 values of the soil organic matter (SOM) show an average of -27.0 parts per thousand,, indicating a C-3 dominant vegetation. The pollen records have also revealed the anthropogenic activities in the form of degra-dation of tree-line and over-grazing by the domesticated animals. The NPPs reflect the prevalence of grazers in the present times, and would be useful in tracing the advent and intensification of grazing in the region. The modern pollen analogues show a good correlation with the fossil pollen data. The present study provides the much needed modern biotic analogues for vegetation-based past climatic reconstructions from the alpine regions of the Western Himalaya.

AB  - The common hydrogeological concepts assume that water mostly enters and flows in fractured and karstified media through preferential pathways related to discontinuities. But it is difficult to locate discontinuities and even more to relate those to possible or effective water routes, particularly when soil or scree covers near surface features. When and where does water flow underground? How fast? Are we able to monitor the infiltration processes? A unique large scale Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) surface based timelapse experiment was carried out in fractured and karstified carbonate rock during a typical Mediterranean autumn rainy episode (230mm of rain over 17 days). 120 ERT timelapse sections were measured over the same profile during and after this event (30 days). The gradient array was chosen for his robustness and rapidity. The site is covered by typical Mediterranean forest and is a good example of the surface conditions found in Mediterranean karst. There is no major karstification features (i.e. cave, sinkhole) or major tectonic accident (i.e. fault). In a previous paper, several commercial and research inversion software were tested on this dataset. This processing highlighted some limitations in in version process. At the actual stage, apparent resistivity data provides insight about recharge/discharge processes that are almost valuable as the inverted resistivity results. Due to his quality, the availability of this unique dataset acquired under natural conditions will allow to the scientific and engineer community exploring advances and limits of ERT approach and to test new software or new data processing strategy.

AB  - Narok County in Kenya is the home to the Maasai Mara Game Reserve, which offers important habitats for a great variety of wild animals, hence, a hub for tourist attraction, earning the county and country an extra income through revenue collection. The Mau Forest Complex in the north is a source of major rivers including the Mara River and a water catchment tower that supports other regions as well. Many rivers present in the region support several activities and livelihood to the people in the area. The study examined how the quantity of surface water resources varied under the different climate change scenarios, and the sensitivity of the region to a changing climate. Several datasets used in this study were collated from different sources and included hydro-meteorological data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) climate projections. The WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning) model was applied using the rainfall-runoff (soil moisture method) approach to compute runoff generated with climate data as input. All the calculations were done on a monthly time step from the current year account to the last year of the scenario. Calibration of the model proceeded using the PEST tool within the WEAP interface. The goodness of fit was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2), percentage bias (PBIAS), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) criterion. From the tests, it was clear that WEAP performed well in simulating stream flows. The coefficient of determination (R-2) was greater than the threshold R-2 > 0.5 in both periods, i.e., 0.83 and 0.97 for calibration and validation periods, respectively, for the monthly flows. A 25-year mean monthly average was chosen with two time slices (2006-2030 and 2031-2055), which were compared against the baseline (1981-2000). There will be a general decrease in water quantity in the region in both scenarios: -30% by 2030 and -23.45% by 2055. In comparison, RCP4.5 and Scenario3 (+2.5 degrees C, +10% P) were higher than RCP8.5 and Scenario 2 respectively. There was also a clear indication that the region was highly sensitive to a perturbation in climate from the synthetic scenarios. A change in either rainfall or temperature (or both) could lead to an impact on the amount of surface water yields.

AB  - The order Rodentia is the largest among other groups of mammals in terms of the number of species and number of individuals and is widely seen in different types of habitats. Various factors affect the spatial distribution of these animals. In this study, according to the same conditions in the two areas in terms of topography, soil, and vegetation type, the distribution of rodent nests in the enclosed and non-enclosed regions of woody pasture in the pistachio forest pasture of Khajeh Kalat in Khorasan Razavi province of Iran has been studied. For this purpose, sample plots with the variable region that had at least 15 trees were used. Inside of each sample plot and under the crown of any tree, rodent nests were identified and counted. Finally, the data obtained from the total sample plots have been analyzed. The results showed that the number of rodent nests in the two regions was significantly at 99% confidence level related to each other, as well as in elevation, slope and aspect was significantly at 99% confidence. Rodent nest distribution is also related to the soil characteristics of the region, and rodents prefer deeper, more fertile soils with a lighter texture and better drainage so that they can dig in easily and rain does not flood their nests. Slope also has an effective role in runoff, infiltration, flood intensity, erodibility, and sedimentation which are not ineffective in rodent release. The north and south aspect are more suitable for rodents due to their moisture and shading and better soil for nesting, and therefore the number of nests in the north and south aspects is higher than in other aspects. Of course, other factors also affect rodent distribution, including ecological relationships, and environmental variables between species, and animals.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a crucial role in hydrological and energy cycles, as well as in the assessments of water resources and irrigation demands. On a regional scale, particularly in the agro-pastoral ecotone, clarification of the distribution of surface ET and its influencing factors is critical for the rational use of water resources, restoration of the ecological environment, and protection of ecological water sources. The SEBAL model was used to invert the regional ET based on Landsat8 images in the agro-pastoral ecotone of northwest China. The results were indirectly verified by monitoring data from meteorological stations. The correlation between ET and surface parameters was analyzed. Thus, the main factors that affect the surface ET were identified. The results show that the SEBAL model determines an accurate inversion, with a correlation coefficient of 0.81 and an average root mean square error of 0.9 mm/d, which is highly suitable for research on water resources. The correlation coefficients of normalized vegetation index, surface temperature, land surface albedo, net radiation flux with daily ET were 0.5830, 0.8425, 0.3428 and 0.9111, respectively. The normalized vegetation index and the net radiation flux positively correlated with the daily ET, while the surface temperature and land surface albedo negatively correlated with the daily ET. The correlation from strong to weak is the net radiation flux > surface temperature > normalized vegetation index > surface albedo. In terms of spatial distribution, the daily ET of water was the highest, followed by woodland, wetland, cropland, built-up land, shrub land, grassland and bare land. However, the SEBAL model overestimates the inversion of daily ET of built-up land.

AB  - The progress of molecular techniques has provided opportunities to comprehensively understand the assemblage patterns of nematode communities in various natural ecosystems. However, we still do not clearly understand whether molecular techniques result in similar assemblage patterns for nematode communities as those generated by conventional morphological analyses. We compared the community structures of soil nematodes depicted by morphological and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) analyses at five different altitudes on Mt. Ibuki, central Japan. Diversity and community composition of soil nematodes were examined from soils in coniferous Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica) forests at altitudes of 200 m, 500 m, and 800 m, in a broad-leaved Shirasawa maple (Acer shirasawanum) forest at an altitude of 1100 m, and in an alpine grassland (Boehmeria silvestrii and Cirsium sp.) at an altitude of 1350 m, by identification with morphotyping or Ion Torrent PGM sequencing. Seventy genera of nematodes were detected; 51 by the HTS method and 46 by the morphological method. Of these, only 27 genera (39 %) were commonly detected in both methods. In non-metric multidimensional scaling ordinations, the nematode communities derived from the two methods were distinctly segregated, but exhibited relatively similar distribution patterns according to environmental gradients within each method. The results indicated that HTS and conventional morphotyping could depict different nematode community structures, but similar community responses to environmental gradients. Thus, HTS analysis can be an effective tool to determine the nematode assemblages responding to environmental changes.

AB  - Mediterranean grasslands are a cornerstone ecosystem to provide ecosystem services and sustain human societies. The sustainability and provision of ecosystem services by these systems rely on their management. One of the main attributes to perform sustainable and effective management is pasture quality, which is crucial for animal performance in rainfed extensive systems. Remote sensing of grasslands can be an effective tool to inform the management of grasslands. The forthcoming high-priority mission candidate of the European Space Agency, Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment (CHIME) with continuous narrow bands of >= 10 nm spectral resolution could be an asset to provide accurate information on the pasture quality of high-diverse and heterogeneous grasslands. In this study, we investigated the potential of CHIME-like field spectroscopy data at 10 nm resolution to assess the quality of Mediterranean permanent grasslands. The pasture quality indicators used were: crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and enzyme digestibility of organic matter (EDOM). To do so, two machine learning methods commonly used in remote sensing were implemented: Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression and Random Forest (RF) regression. The results using all bands in the 400-2300 nm spectral range and the results obtained by Backward Feature Elimination (BFE) were also compared. Finally, using importance measures of PLS and RF and the BFE approach, the importance and stability of the bands to assess the pasture quality indicators were explored. The results showed that field spectroscopy CHIME-like data at 10 nm of spectral resolution show potential to predict CP at "good" accuracy and NDF at "moderate" accuracy level in Mediterranean permanent grasslands. PLS outperformed RF to predict CP and NDF in terms of accuracy and certainty of the predictions. The BFE approach increased the accuracy of the predictions, especially in PLS, for which a percentage decrease of Delta RMSE = -12.5% was achieved in crossvalidation to predict CP. The models built by BFE approach to predict CP using PLS provided a mean R-2 value of 0.82 and a range of 0.68-0.90 in bootstrapped predictions. The RMSE was low (mean RMSE = 2.23%) and the mean RPD = 2.47 with values ranging from 1.81 to 3.23. RF models to predict CP produced mean R-2 value of 0.68, mean RMSE = 3.00% and mean RPD = 1.82. ADF and EDOM were predicted with poor accuracy and similarly by both, PLS and RF. The bands located in the red-edge and NIR region showed high importance and stability to assess the best-predicted variables. Bands centred at 700, 710, 1160, 1170 and 1180 are highly stable and important to predict CP. The bands from the SWIR region had lower stability. This study provides insightful results on the use of hyperspectral data and future satellite missions such as CHIME to assess the pasture quality of Mediterranean grasslands that can be crucial to inform the management and monitoring of Mediterranean permanent grasslands.

AB  - To define the chances of a dispersed seed to produce a new recruit, it is essential to consider all stages of the dispersal process. Howler monkeys are recognized to have positive impacts on forest regeneration, acting as primary dispersers. Furthermore, dung beetles attracted to their feces protect the seeds against predators, and provide a better microenvironment for germination due to the removal of fecal matter, to seed burial, and/or by reducing the spatial aggregation of seeds in fecal clumps. Despite the recognized positive effects of primary seed dispersal through defecation by howler monkeys for plant recruitment, there are some important aspects of their behavior, such as the habit of defecating in latrines, that remain to be explored. Here, we investigated the fate of Campomanesia xanthocarpa seeds defecated by brown howlers, Alouatta guariba clamitans, and the secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles, considering how this process is affected by the monkey's defecation patterns. We found that brown howler monkeys dispersed seeds from several species away from fruit-feeding trees, partly because defecation under the canopy of such trees was not very frequent. Instead, most defecations were associated with latrines under overnight sleeping trees. Despite a very similar dung beetle community attracted to howler feces in latrines and fruit-feeding sites, seeds were more likely to be buried when deposited in latrines. In addition, C. xanthocarpa seeds showed higher germination and establishment success in latrines, but this positive effect was not due to the presence of fecal matter surrounding seeds. Our results highlight that A. guariba clamitans acts as a legitimate seed disperser of C. xanthocarpa seeds in a preserved context of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and that defecations in latrines increase the dispersal effectiveness.

AB  - Soil labile organic carbon (LOC) fractions are very sensitive to environmental change and closely related to soil quality. They play an important role in the study of terrestrial carbon cycles. This study aimed to explore the sensitivity of soil LOC fractions to environmental changes and analyze their main influencing factors during three seasonal water level periods for scientific management of Dongting Lake wetlands. Soil under three typical wetland types (Carextristachya wetland (CTW), Phragmites australis wetland (PAW) and Salix babylonica (SBW)) in East Dongting Lake in China were collected during the normal season (May), rainy season (August) and dry season (December). Seasonal dynamics of soil LOC fractions (i.e., dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and easily oxidized carbon (EOC)) within these wetlands and their relationship to soil nutrients and carbon-cycle enzyme activity were analyzed. The results showed that the soil DOC contents of the three wetlands first increased and then decreased, with the exception of CTW from the normal season to the dry season, while the seasonal changes of soil MBC and EOC for all wetlands followed an opposite pattern. CTW had the largest DOC concentration (228.29 mg center dot kg(-1)) during dry season, while the highest contents of soil DOC, MBC and EOC were found in PAW during the three observed seasons, which ranged from 82.05 to 203.60 mg center dot kg(-1), 262.54 to 325.74 mg center dot kg(-1) and 3.30 to 4.61 g center dot kg(-1), respectively. However, the contents of soil DOC and their proportions to soil organic carbon (SOC) of all wetlands during the normal season were 56.58~82.05 mg center dot kg(-1) and 0.41~0.47%, respectively, which were the lowest among the three seasons. Nevertheless, the contents of both MBC and EOC as well as their ratios to SOC in these wetlands showed similar seasonal dynamics, with the lowest values recorded in the rainy season. From the normal season to the dry season, invertase activity in all wetlands increased, while cellulase activity decreased by 12.5-31.3%. The seasonal variation of catalase activity for all wetlands was less distinctive, and the highest enzyme activity was during the rainy season. Correlation analysis revealed that soil LOC fractions for all wetlands were closely related to SOC, TN, TP and invertase for the three seasons, especially during the rainy season, but were negatively correlated with TK, cellulase and catalase activity. Generally, soil LOC fractions of the three wetlands were affected by the seasonal fluctuations of water levels and presented different distribution characteristics.

AB  - Climate warming in recent decades has negatively impacted forest health in the western United States. Here, we report on potential early warning signals (EWS) for drought-related mortality derived from measurements of tree-ring growth (ring width index; RWI) and carbon isotope discrimination ( increment C-13), primarily focused on ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Sampling was conducted in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains, near the epicenter of drought severity and mortality associated with the 2012-2015 California drought and concurrent outbreak of western pine beetle (Dendroctonus brevicomis). At this site, we found that widespread mortality was presaged by five decades of increasing sensitivity (i.e., increased explained variation) of both tree growth and increment C-13 to Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). We hypothesized that increasing sensitivity of tree growth and increment C-13 to hydroclimate constitute EWS that indicate an increased likelihood of widespread forest mortality caused by direct and indirect effects of drought. We then tested these EWS in additional ponderosa pine-dominated forests that experienced varying mortality rates associated with the same California drought event. In general, drier sites showed increasing sensitivity of RWI to PDSI over the last century, as well as higher mortality following the California drought event compared to wetter sites. Two sites displayed evidence that thinning or fire events that reduced stand basal area effectively reversed the trend of increasing hydroclimate sensitivity. These comparisons indicate that reducing competition for soil water and/or decreasing bark beetle host tree density via forest management-particularly in drier regions-may buffer these forests against drought stress and associated mortality risk. EWS such as these could provide land managers more time to mitigate the extent or severity of forest mortality in advance of droughts. Substantial efforts at deploying additional dendrochronological research in concert with remote sensing and forest modeling will aid in forecasting of forest responses to continued climate warming.

AB  - Forest ecosystems are increasingly exposed to the combined pressure of climate change and attacks by pests and pathogens. These stress factors can threaten already vulnerable species triggering dieback and rising defoliation and mortality rates. To characterize abiotic (drought, climate warmings) and biotic (pathogens) risks and their spatiotemporal patterns we quantified the recent loss of vitality for the endangered and relict Abies pinsapo forests from Andalusia, south-eastern Spain. Abies pinsapo is an iconic Mediterranean fir showing a high vulnerability to drought stress and also to several pests (Cryphalus numidicus) and root rot fungi (Armillaria mellea). We analyzed a monitoring network dataset of radial growth, defoliation and mortality from 2001 to 2017 including 1025 trees situated in three major mountain ranges (Sierra de Grazalema, Sierra de las Nieves, and Sierra Bermeja). We fitted several statistical models to determine the main drivers of changes in defoliation, a proxy of tree vigor, and mortality. Defoliation and mortality rates were much higher towards the East of the study area, mirroring the gradient from Atlantic to Mediterranean climatic conditions. In the most affected stands tree defoliation increased in response to a combination of long and severe droughts, with attacks by the beetle C. numidicus. Mortality rates increased in response to a higher defoliation rate, a lower relative radial-growth rate, long and severe droughts and a higher incidence of A. mellea. Our findings illustrate the value of monitoring networks recording changes in forest health to quantify and forecast future vulnerability of threatened tree species.

AB  - Both chemical and physical properties of soils have been used for two centuries for explaining differences in species composition and diversity between plant communities from calcareous and siliceous soils. Here, we examine the prediction from the 'physical hypothesis', which proposes that species from siliceous soils are absent from calcareous soils because of high drought stress, while species from calcareous soils are absent from siliceous soils because of high competition due to higher water availability. This hypothesis therefore predicts a trade-off between stress tolerance and competitive response that allows calcareous and siliceous species to dominate their respective communities. There has been no attempt to experimentally assess these predictions. We cross-transplanted with and without neighbours using a removal experiment, two dominant species from calcareous soils (Bromus erectus and Brachypodium sylvaticum) and two species from siliceous soils (Pseudarrhenatherum longifolium and Deschampsia flexuosa) in herbaceous communities from the two soils types. We repeated the experiment 4 years, taking advantage of inter-annual climatic variability to test the interplay between year quality (dry vs. wet years) and soil types on survival responses with and without neighbours. We quantified species stress tolerances, their competitive responses and the competitive effect of the two community types. In the absence of neighbours, species from siliceous soils had much lower survival than species from calcareous soils during dry years, in particular on calcareous soils. It indicates a lower stress tolerance of siliceous species and a higher level of stress occurring on calcareous soils. Competition strongly reduced the survival of calcareous but not siliceous species, indicating a greater competitive response of the latter and competition was more important on siliceous soils than on calcareous soils during wet years. However, we found that species stress tolerances were more important than competitive effect of neighbours in driving differences in species composition. Synthesis. The contrasting responses found for dominant species from calcareous and siliceous soils support the trade-off between stress tolerance and competitive response proposed by the physical hypothesis. Our results bring additional evidence that differences in water availability and stress between the two soil types are driving species responses to bedrock types.

AB  - Iron is one of the most abundant elements on the planet and a micronutrient for most organisms. In many coastal regions worldwide, mangrove forests affect the dynamics and mobility of different elements to the oceans especially through their soils. The biogeochemistry of mangrove soils responds to numerous factors that vary within different spatial and time scales. In this sense, seasonality can be crucial in determining the role of these ecosystems towards the iron biogeochemical cycle. Thus, the main goal of the present study was to assess the effects of contrasting climatic conditions on iron biogeochemistry in different mangrove forests along the Brazilian coast. We studied the soils (n = 435) of 14 different mangrove forests distributed along two contrasting climate regions: the semi-arid Northeast and the humid Southeast coasts of Brazil. In the SE region, water surplus and lower temperatures in both seasons did not cause significant changes in iron concentrations (wet season: 216 mu mol g(-1); dry season: 230 mu mol g(-1)) where oxyhydroxides and pyrite immobilize iron in the mangrove soils. In contrast, in the semi-arid mangroves, a marked water deficit during the dry season caused both pyrite oxidation and iron reprecipitation as oxyhydroxides. Contrarily, in the rainy season, the establishment of a suboxic environment (Eh similar to + 100 mV) favored significant iron losses via iron reduction. We conclude that seasonality can affect the maintenance and cycling of iron in mangrove soils, which may function as important sources of this element for adjacent ecosystems.

AB  - How flowing water and organisms can shape Earth's surface, the Critical Zone, depends on how fast this layer is turned over by erosion. To quantify the dependence of rock weathering and the cycling of elements through ecosystems on erosion we have used existing and new metrics that quantify the partitioning and cycling of elements between rock, saprolite, soil, plants, and river dissolved and solid loads. We demonstrate their utility at three sites along a global transect of mountain landscapes that differ in erosion rates - an "erodosequence". These sites are the Swiss Central Alps, a rapidly-eroding, post-glacial mountain belt; the Southern Sierra Nevada, USA, eroding at moderate rates; and the slowly-eroding tropical Highlands of Sri Lanka. The backbone of this analysis is an extensive data set of rock, saprolite, soil, water, and plant geochemical and isotopic data. This set of material properties is converted into process rates by using regolith production and weathering rates from cosmogenic nuclides and river loads, and estimates of biomass growth. Combined, these metrics allow us to derive elemental fluxes through regolith and vegetation. The main findings are: 1) the rates of weathering are set locally in regolith, and not by the rate at which entire landscapes erode; 2) the degree of weathering is mainly controlled by regolith residence time. This results in supply-limited weathering in Sri Lanka where weathering runs to completion in the regolith, and kinetically-limited weathering in the Alps and Sierra Nevada where soluble primary minerals persist; 3) these weathering characteristics are reflected in the sites' eco-system processes, namely in that nutritive elements are intensely recycled in the supply-limited setting, and directly taken up from soil and rock in the kinetically settings; 4) the weathering rates are not controlled by biomass growth; 5) at all sites we find a deficit in river solute export when compared to solute production in regolith, the extent of which differs between elements. Plant uptake followed by litter export might explain this deficit for biologically utilized elements of high solubility, and rare, high-discharge flushing events for colloidal-bound elements of low solubility. Our data and new metrics have begun to serve for calibrating metal isotope systems in the weathering zone, the isotope ratios of which depend on the flux partitioning between the compartments of the Critical Zone. We demonstrate this application in several isotope geochemical companion papers.

AB  - Drought in the forest is not only a prolonged state of water shortage, but also an occasion where interactions between plants and fungi are affected. Water efficiency accelerates a range of pathologies in interactions between organisms, influencing the ecosystems and their interacting biological components. This study focuses on the role of mycorrhizal and endophyte fungi in alleviating the effects of soil water shortage, and on the impact of their altered activity during drought on the health of trees. The issues presented here show the fundamental role of the mycorrhizal mycelium and the mechanism of water transport to the plant in the course of other phenomena (withering, pathogenesis, endophytes biology) that occur in trees under influence of drought, with particular attention on managed coniferous stands. Conclusions resulting from published information on this topic emphasize the negative impact of soil moisture deficiency on the ectomycorrhizal fungi functioning and, in contrast, on the promotion of the growth of some endophytes, pathogens and hemi-parasitic mistletoes (Viscum spp.).

AB  - Drought can have pervasive and wide-spread impacts to forest health, as evidenced in several severe events occurring over the recent decades. Extensive forest die-off due to drought can impair the ecological functioning of forests, impacting habitat, water yield and quality from forested lands, and altering forest fire dynamics and intensity. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for detecting and monitoring spatial patterns of forest mortality over large areas, exploiting free and open long-term image archives available at a range in spatial and temporal resolutions. While remotely sensed surface reflectances and vegetation indices have been widely used to study optical response of forest canopies to drought events, retrievals of evapotranspiration (ET) derived from thermal satellite imagery - particularly at resolutions approaching crown scale can provide insights into cumulative tree stresses that can incite disease and trigger mortality. In this study, we applied a multi-sensor satellite data fusion approach to estimate daily 30-m resolution ET and an associated Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) to study drought-induced mortality in a temperate forest at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux (MOFLUX) site, located in the central United States. The study covered the period from 2010 to 2014, including an exceptional drought year of 2012. Modeled ET agreed well with eddy flux measurements from the MOFLUX tower, with average monthly relative errors of 15%. Plot-scale ESI, describing temporal anomalies in the ratio of actual-to-reference ET, was used as an index of relative forest health to investigate relationships between forest mortality and drought severity. ESI showed good agreement with observed predawn leaf water potential, especially during the drought year. Furthermore, plot scale ESI was also correlated with the subsequent year's tree mortality, suggesting the importance of considering the forest health condition prior to drought when studying drought-induced forest impacts. This study demonstrates the utility of multi-year ET remote sensing data at the stand or plot scale as an indicator of forest health and as a predictor of future mortality due to drought.

AB  - Paulownia is a well-known, fast-growing tree genus that is widely planted for commercial cultivation in the warm temperate zone of the North China Plain. Fertilization as a standard practice can efficiently increase wood production and tree yield in those Paulownia plantations, but how different fertilization measures might affect soil microbial activity, microbial biomass and metabolic functioning unclear, especially in the subtropics. To fill this knowledge gap, we initiated long-term different fertilization experiments from afforestation, using a completely randomized block design consisting of a control, inorganic fertilizer, microelement-inorganic fertilizer and organic-inorganic compound fertilizer (OIF) treatments in South China's subtropical zone. The results revealed fertilization significantly increased soil enzyme activity and microbial biomass, especially that of urease, invertase, acid phosphatase, as well as the microbial biomass in terms of carbon and nitrogen, all of which increased most significantly in soil under the OIF treatment. The carbon source utilization levels of five carbon substrates under the OIF treatment, namely D-xylose, glucose-1-phosphate, D-cellobiose, alpha-ketobutyric acid and glycogen, were significantly higher than those of the others. From these data, we may reasonably infer that the application of organic fertilizer could offer an effective management practice for use in Paulownia plantations. The five carbon matrices may be the most efficient carbon sources for increasing the abundance of efficient soil microorganisms, improving soil fertility and achieving the sustainable development of Paulownia plantations.

AB  - The hyperaccumulator Pycnandra acuminata is a New Caledonian rainforest tree known to have the highest concentration of nickel in any living organism, with 25 wt% nickel in its latex. All trees (with a diameter of >10 cm) and soil profiles in a 0.25-hectare permanent plot were sampled to assess the biogeochemical compartmentalisation of nickel in a dense stand of P. acuminata trees. Nickel stable isotope analysis permitted insights into the cycling of nickel in this ecosystem. The total tree biomass of the plot was calculated to be 281 tonnes ha(-1), which contained 0.44 kg of cobalt, 49.1 kg of manganese, 257 kg of nickel and 6.76 kg of zinc. Nickel stable isotope analysis identified the biotic origin of the nickel in the soil upper layers, with P. acuminata shoots enriched in lighter nickel isotopes. The delta Ni-60 latex signature suggests that long-distance transport, radial xylem and phloem loading are at play in P. acuminata.

AB  - Perennially and intermittently available water in lentic, spring-fed herbaceous meadows supports wetland plants that build and maintain absorbent soil organic matter, capture sediment, prevent erosion, and thereby sustain riparian ecosystems. Enhanced forage and available water attract a diversity of wildlife and grazing animals that can degrade riparian vegetation through prolonged overuse. We tested novel monitoring methods and adapted existing methods to obtain quantified vegetation data that have been consistently linked to riparian functionality and compared these data to ungulate species use. We quantified ungulate use with time-lapse cameras at 10 Nevada spring-fed herbaceous meadows where core greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat, public land grazing allotments, and free-roaming horse (Equus caballus) herd management areas (Bureau of Land Management) or territories (U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service) overlapped. Free-roaming horses used most study sites over longer periods and grazed more intensely than cattle or domestic sheep. Native ungulate grazing intensity was comparatively negligible. Free-roaming horses selected spring-fed meadow sites on average 51 (+/- 33 [SE]) times more than the surrounding rangelands, and cattle selected them 30 +/- 23 times more. Within the wettest area of a site, study sites with longer duration of use and higher intensity of use had more soil alteration and bare ground. Riparian ecosystem degradation occurred where meadows had limited rest or recovery time from grazing during the growing season. At all sites we noted loss of riparian function, especially within the hydric areas with the highest potential to grow abundant cover of stabilizing wetland plant species. Transects for monitoring soil alteration and vegetation cover in this hydric location can provide a leading indicator of riparian recovery or degradation and help in adjusting free-roaming horse population levels or livestock management strategies.

AB  - At the spring, goat and sheep herds are transferred to planted forests, in a semi-arid region in the northern Negev Desert, Israel, to reduce herbaceous biomass and, fire risk. The herds are held overnight in corrals for about 4 months, enriching the soil with organic matter and nitrogen. This research examined the effect of these enrichments on soil bacterial community structure (BCS) and the abundance of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) in active and abandoned corrals (1-10-years-old). Based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla dominated the soil of all corrals. The Actinobacteria were less abundant in the active and 1-year-old corrals (23-26%) than in the other corrals and the control (33-38%). A principal component analysis showed that, the BCS in the active and the 1-year-old abandoned corrals was significantly different from that in the older corrals and the control. The Firmicutes phylum constituted 28% of the BCS in the active corrals, 12.5% in the 1-year-old corrals and 2% in the older corrals and the control. In contrast, the Acidobacteria phylum was hardly detected in the active and 1-year-old abandoned corrals and constituted 10% of the BCS in the older corrals. Genes conferring resistance to tetracycline were detected in high numbers. The tetG and tetW genes were detected in the active and abandoned corrals (1-10 years). The tetQ gene was detected only in the active and 1-year-old abandoned corrals. None of the genes were detected in the control soil. The three genes were detected outside an active corral, in the downstream section of an ephemeral tributary. The results prove that abandoned and unobserved periodic animal corrals are an environmental reservoir for TRGs.

AB  - Coffee production in the form of agroforestry practices is the most important management approach to improve the livelihoods of the farming community. This study was conducted to assess factors affecting the adoption of the technology, its socioeconomic and environmental benefits, and the management practices related to the technology. Out of eight kebeles in the district, two kebeles were selected purposively based on the existing and extensive agroforestry practices. Four villages were selected randomly. Based on the preidentified criteria as coffee growers and nongrowers, coffee growers were selected purposively. Then a total of 120 households were selected by Simple Random Sampling Method. Data were collected by using structured interview and field observation. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics analysis. The logit model was used to identify the factors affecting the adoption of coffee shade agroforestry technology. The results of this study showed that adoption of coffee shade agroforestry technology had a positive relationship and was statistically significant at 1% level with age and area covered by coffee production, while household composition and training were at 5% level. Education level, land holding, and extension services also had positive relationship, but it was not statistically significant. The farmers in the study area mentioned other benefits of these technologies such as for animal feed, firewood and construction materials, medicinal purpose, erosion control, honey bee production, and soil fertility enhancement. Different management activities were also identified in the area (such as composting, pruning, watering, and weeding). Coffee shade agroforestry technology was important to diversify the agricultural products, to solve the problem of livelihood, and adds economic and environmental benefits.

AB  - Habitat loss is one of the greatest drivers for extinction worldwide. Understanding a taxon's habitat requirements is crucial in being able to protect it from decline. The Australasian trapdoor spider genus Cantuaria (Idiopidae) is widespread and diverse within the islands of New Zealand, but little is known of its ecology. We studied the habitat requirements of Cantuaria, using niche modelling, to inform conservation efforts and predict how the genus may fare under future climate conditions. Two data sets were employed. A fine-scale data set used hand-collected data from the vicinity of individual burrows for localised soil, vegetation, and human disturbance data directly inside and adjacent to Cantuaria populations. A spatial GIS data set at the landscape level mapped presence/absence of populations, as well as general environmental and soil conditions, and vegetation type. The two data sets were analysed separately, using linear models for the fine-scale data set (17 presences, 17 absences). General linear models were used to analyse the spatial data set (72 presences, 17 absences), with variables selected using a random forest analysis in R. In the fine-scale data set, no significant variables were found. In the spatial data set, rainfall explained most (71.4%) of the variation, according to the random forest analysis, followed by soil group (33.71%) and elevation (27.12%). Some variation was explained by more than one factor. The two models with the lowest AICC numbers included rainfall (P < 0.01) and elevation (P = 0.06), or rainfall only (P < 0.01), as variables. We conclude that low rainfall is desirable for populations of most Cantuaria spp., although some have been found where rainfall is up to 3000 mm/year. Climate change may cause challenges for Cantuaria conservation, particularly in areas with increased rainfall, such as Southland, Tasman, the West Coast, and Central Otago. Elevation and soil type may also be important factors in Cantuaria habitat selection, but further research with gene flow analysis, captive studies, more structured sampling, and/or a greater sample size may reveal more about the effects of elevation and soil type on Cantuaria populations.

AB  - Pines are the dominant conifers in Mediterranean forests. As long-lived sessile organisms that seasonally have to cope with drought periods, they have developed a variety of adaptive responses. However, during last decades, highly intense and long-lasting drought events could have contributed to decay and mortality of the most susceptible trees. Among conifer species, Pinus pinaster Ait. shows remarkable ability to adapt to different environments. Previous molecular analysis of a full-sib family designed to study drought response led us to find active transcriptional activity of stress-responding genes even without water deprivation in tolerant genotypes. To improve our knowledge about communication between above- and below-ground organs of maritime pine, we have analyzed four graft-type constructions using two siblings as rootstocks and their progenitors, Gal 1056 and Oria 6, as scions. Transcriptomic profiles of needles from both scions were modified by the rootstock they were grafted on. However, the most significant differential gene expression was observed in drought-sensitive Gal 1056, while in drought-tolerant Oria 6, differential gene expression was very much lower. Furthermore, both scions grafted onto drought-tolerant rootstocks showed activation of genes involved in tolerance to abiotic stress, and is most remarkable in Oria 6 grafts where higher accumulation of transcripts involved in phytohormone action, transcriptional regulation, photosynthesis and signaling has been found. Additionally, processes, such as those related to secondary metabolism, were mainly associated with the scion genotype. This study provides pioneering information about rootstock effects on scion gene expression in conifers.

AB  - Desertification threatens land integrity, hinders the improvement of livelihoods, restricts global economic development, and affects social stability. The countries and regions involved in the Belt and Road Initiative have long suffered from varying degrees of desertification, land degradation and drought, and experience the most severe desertification of anywhere on the planet. Existing research on desertification has mainly focused on technical aspects of this problem and on sand control and management. Most studies have covered topics such as dryland, forestry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and water and soil conservation. However, few studies have been conducted from the perspective of public policy. In particular, policies and regulations for the prevention and control of desertification in countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative remain poorly understood and undervalued. This study therefore examined policies and regulations for preventing and controlling desertification in re-presentative Belt and Road countries. The developmental context, formulation of measures to safeguard the environment, modes and effects of their implementation, and the overall management systems in these countries were analyzed, and their similarities, differences, and correlations were explored in depth. The findings of the study will provide inputs for promoting cooperation among industries, enterprises, and institutions in typical desertified countries, whose collaborative efforts will contribute to promoting green development within the Belt and Road Initiative. Moreover, they will provide a reference for researchers, policy makers, and environmental regulators to shape the next generation of desertification control policies and regulations and to support environmentally sustainable implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The soil contaminated with heavy metals requires special attention due to its adverse effects on health of human and animals. The effects of simulated acid rain with different pH values on transport of heavy metal in contaminated soil of Phyllostachys pubescens forest were studied by indoor leaching column test. The results revealed that particle size of soil was mainly concentrated in range of more than 50 mu m. The content of heavy metals in particles less than 50 mu m was relatively high. The Pb and Zn were mainly adsorbed on colloidal particles and were transported during simulated acid rain. The release of Fe and Al increased the release of particulate matter in soil leaching solution. The mobility of Zn was increased at low pH.

AB  - Fire suppression in the western United States has significantly altered forest composition and structure, resulting in a higher risk of stand-replacing fire, large-scale drought mortality, and bark beetle outbreaks. Mechanical thinning and prescribed fire are common treatments designed to reduce high-severity fire risk, but few studies have tracked long-term understory plant community response to these treatments with repeated fire application that emulates historic fire regimes. We evaluate changes in understory plant diversity and composition, as well as light availability, soil moisture, and litter depth over two decades following a factorial field experiment crossing thinning and two applications of prescribed fire at the Teakettle Experimental Forest (TEF) in the southern Sierra Nevada. We compare responses in experimental fuels treatments against those in nearby old-growth, mixedconifer forests with restored low-severity fire regimes in Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks. We hypothesized that 1) understory plant richness, evenness, and beta diversity would increase with each burn event; 2) repeated fire after initial thinning would produce the highest understory plant diversity; 3) the second burn would reduce shrub cover, especially in the initially thinned treatments that demonstrated vigorous Ceanothus cordulatus growth after initial treatments; 4) the second burn would increase light availability and bare ground while reducing litter depth; and 5) treatments with initial thinning followed by multiple prescribed burns would show the greatest similarities to reference forests in diversity metrics, shrub cover, and environmental conditions. Although initially local (10 m2-scale) understory plant richness and diversity increased most following thinning combined with prescribed fire, this treatment did not generate understory conditions similar to those in nearby reference forests over the long term. Vigorous shrub growth resulted in low understory evenness and beta diversity over time, which a secondary burn treatment did not alter. Burning without thinning retained a more heterogeneous understory following initial treatment. Two years after the second burn treatment, this burning without thinning resulted in high understory richness and evenness similar to reference forest understories. Our results suggest management treatments may need to focus on creating heterogeneity in burn effects to limit shrub cover and foster more diverse understory communities.

AB  - Key message The high mortality and low recruitment of the myrmecophytic Acacia drepanolobium are not consistent with the demographic rates of monodominant species. The positive conspecific density dependence observed from the spatial analysis is consistent with the defensive benefits conferred by symbiotic ants to trees when they grow close to each other. Patches of savanna dominated by Acacia drepanolobium occur throughout East Africa on nutrient-rich vertisols, also known as black cotton soils. We assessed the survival and recruitment for all freestanding trees with diameter at knee height (dkh) >= 10 mm in one of such mono-dominated patches (47 ha) at the Mpala Research Centre, Kenya, with the aim of identifying demographic traits that might explain the dominance of this species. Over a mean 6-year interval, mortality and recruitment rates in the habitat were 4.55%/year and 1.42%/year respectively, resulting in a net loss of 17.8% of the initial individuals. Of the 30 species recorded from the first census, 11 decreased in abundance, nine increased, and the remainder 10 did not change in abundance. The monodominant A. drepanolobium had a high mortality (4.69%/year), a low recruitment (1.31%/year), and a 19% population decline. There was no evidence of conspecific negative density dependence for this species. Rather, we found a statistically significant positive correlation between the number of conspecific neighbors and individual-level probability of survival, consistent with the "shared defense" benefits that symbiotic ant colonies occupying multiple trees can confer to these latter in a small neighborhood. Thus, mortality of A. drepanolobium was higher in areas where it occurred in lower densities, which resulted in an increase in the spatial aggregation of conspecifics. Mortality increased with dkh size classes and was mostly caused by elephants and stem-boring beetles. The demographic rates during the study period in theory are inconsistent with those of monodominant species. The protection against herbivory conferred by mutualistic ants associated with this species remains the most probable explanation of its dominance in this habitat.

AB  - The magnitude of termite methane (CH4) emissions is still an uncertain part of the global CH4 budget and current emission estimates are based on limited field studies. We present in situ CH4 emission measurements of termite mounds and termite mound subsamples performed in the Amazon rainforest. Emissions from five termite mounds of the species Neocapritermes brasiliensis were measured by use of a large flux chamber connected to a portable gas analyser measuring CH4 and CO2. In addition, the emissions of mound subsamples were measured, after which the termites were counted so that a termite CH4 and CO2 emission factor could be determined.
   Mound emissions were found to range between 17.0 and 34.8 nmol mound(-1) s(-1) for CH4 and between 1.1 and 13.0 mu mol mound(-1) s(-1) for CO2. A termite emission factor of 0.35 mu mol CH4 g(termite)(-1) h(-1) was found, which is almost twice as high as the only other reported value for the Amazon. By combining mound emission measurements with the termite emission factor, colony sizes could be estimated, which were found to range between 55-125 thousand individuals. Estimates were similar to literature values, and we therefore propose that this method can be used as a quick non-intrusive method to estimate termite colony size in the field.
   The role of termites in the ecosystem's CH4 budget was evaluated by use of two approaches. Termite mound emission values were combined with local mound density numbers, leading to an estimate of 0.15-0.71 nmol CH4 m(-2) s(-1), on average, emitted by termite mounds. In addition, the termite CH4 emission factor from this study was combined with termite biomass numbers, resulting in an estimate of termite-emitted CH4 of similar to 1.0 nmol m(-2) s(-1). Considering the relatively low net CH4 emissions previously measured at this ecosystem, we expect that termites play an important role in the CH4 budget of this terra firme ecosystem.

AB  - Silvopasture, an agroforestry practice combining forages, livestock, and trees, has been shown to optimize productivity and mitigate the effects of environmental stress on livestock, yet few ranchers in Panama deliberately incorporate trees into pastures. Panama's Azuero Peninsula experiences a five-month dry season that results in substantial losses in grass productivity. We studied three cultivars of Guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus cv. Massai, cv. Mombaza, and cv. Tanzania) under open (O), moderate (M), and dense (D) tree canopies. We hypothesized that changes in soil properties, herbage mass, and nutritive value would be optimized in M in agreement with the stress gradient hypothesis, which predicts an increase in facilitation with increasing environmental stress. Results after two years showed few changes in soil chemical properties, but bulk density decreased with increasing tree cover. Annually, O produced more herbage mass than M and D and Massai produced more herbage mass than Mombaza, but not compared to Tanzania. Nutritive value improved under tree cover, with D and M showing higher relative feed values than O. Massai demonstrated the greatest tolerance to drought in M, producing more herbage mass in February when compared to D and O. Results partially support the hypothesis, suggesting that herbage mass is greatest in M for Massai during the dry season, but greatest in O over the year. The observed productivity under moderate tree densities could result in improved animal welfare between the months of December and May, the critical dry period for this region.

AB  - Biological invasions by cryptic ecosystem engineers can alter the ecological and socio-economic values of ecosystems in ways that may take decades to detect. The invasion of North American glacial refuges by non-native earthworms offers a prominent but understudied example of a cryptic invasion. Non-native earthworms are known to alter carbon sequestration, disrupt mycorrhizal networks and homogenize plant communities, but natural resource managers still lack robust protocols to identify and safeguard high conservation value communities (HCVCs) from such invasions. In the absence of such protocols, or reliable methods to eradicate non-native earthworm populations once established, there is an urgent need for methods to identify HCVCs at risk of or potentially shielded from earthworm invasion by the existence of abiotic barriers to their dispersal or persistence in such sites. We developed species distribution models (SDMs) using in situ field surveys and remotely sensed data to (1) identify factors limiting the occurrence of non-native Lumbricus earthworms in imperilled coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest and Garry oak (Quercus garryana) and maritime meadow ecosystems endemic to glacial refugia of the Pacific Northwest of North America and to (2) evaluate their influence on plant species diversity and identify abiotic factors capable of preventing their dispersal or persistence at a site. As predicted, shallow, drier soils and steeper terrain limited earthworm occurrence and abundance in our highly heterogeneous study area, and earthworm presence appeared to reduce plant species richness. Our results indicated that HCVCs endemic to shallow-soil (< 12 +/- 3 cm) sites that experience regular summer drought appear to act as refuges from invasion by non-native earthworms. Our results also elevate concerns for the conservation of deep-soil habitats not isolated from earthworm invasions by shallow soil, saltwater or other barriers to earthworm dispersal. The SDMs developed here offer guidance to the identification of potential refuges for the conservation of imperilled native species and communities from the detrimental effects non-native earthworms in glacial refugia of western North America and should thereby facilitate proactive planning by conservation practitioners.

AB  - Species of Armillaria are distributed globally and include some of the most important pathogens of forest and ornamental trees. Some of them form large long-living clones that are considered as one of the largest organisms on earth and are capable of long-range spore-mediated transfer as well as vegetative spread by drought-resistant hyphal cords called rhizomorphs. However, the virus community infecting these species has remained unknown. In this study we used dsRNA screening and high-throughput sequencing to search for possible virus infections in a collection of Armillaria isolates representing three different species: Armillaria mellea from South Africa, A. borealis from Finland and Russia (Siberia) and A. cepistipes from Finland. Our analysis revealed the presence of both negative-sense RNA viruses and positive-sense RNA viruses, while no dsRNA viruses were detected. The viruses included putative new members of virus families Mymonaviridae, Botourmiaviridae and Virgaviridae and members of a recently discovered virus group tentatively named "ambiviruses" with ambisense bicistronic genomic organization. We demonstrated that Armillaria isolates can be cured of viruses by thermal treatment, which enables the examination of virus effects on host growth and phenotype using isogenic virus-infected and virus-free strains.

AB  - Biological soil amendments of animal origin (BSAAO) increase nutrient levels in soils to support the production of fruits and vegetables. BSAAOs may introduce or extend the survival of bacterial pathogens which can be transferred to fruits and vegetables to cause foodborne illness. Escherichia coli survival over 120 days in soil plots (3 m2) covered with (mulched) or without plastic mulch (not mulched), amended with either poultry litter, composted poultry litter, heat-treated poultry pellets, or chemical fertilizer, and transfer to cucumbers in 2 years (2018 and 2019) were evaluated. Plots were inoculated with E. coli (8.5 log CFU/m(2)) and planted with cucumber seedlings (Supremo). The number of days needed to reduce E. coli levels by 4 log CFU (dpi4log) was determined using a sigmoidal decline model. Random forest regression and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; P, 0.05) identified predictors (soil properties, nutrients, and weather factors) of dpi4log of E. coli and transfer to cucumbers. The combination of year, amendment, and mulch (25.0% increase in the mean square error [IncMSE]) and year (9.75% IncMSE) were the most prominent predictors of dpi4log and transfer to cucumbers, respectively. Nitrate levels at 30 days and soil moisture at 40 days were also impactful predictors of dpi4log. Differing rainfall amounts in 2018 (24.9 in.) and 2019 (12.6 in.) affected E. coli survival in soils and transfer to cucumbers. Salmonella spp. were recovered sporadically from various plots but were not recovered from cucumbers in either year. Greater transfer of E. coli to cucumbers was also shown to be partially dependent on dpi4log of E. coli in plots containing BSAAO.
   IMPORTANCE Poultry litter and other biological soil amendments are commonly used fertilizers in fruit and vegetable production and can introduce enteric pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 or Salmonella previously associated with outbreaks of illness linked to contaminated produce. E. coli survival duration in soils covered with plastic mulch or uncovered and containing poultry litter or heat-treated poultry litter pellets were evaluated. Nitrate levels on day 30 and moisture content in soils on day 40 on specific days were good predictors of E. coli survival in soils; however, the combination of year, amendment, and mulch type was a better predictor. Different cumulative rainfall totals from year to year most likely affected the transfer of E. coli from soils to cucumbers and survival durations in soil. E. coli survival in soils can be extended by the addition of several poultry litter-based soil amendments commonly used in organic production of fruits and vegetables and is highly dependent on temporal variation in rainfall.

AB  - In the Lower Rio Grande Valley (LRGV) of south Texas, native thornscrub forest restoration has been ongoing for the past four decades, yet few assessments of their efficacy exist, and no study has yet quantified species-specific responses. Seedling transplantation in conjunction one or more restoration interventions (RIs) remains the method of choice at most sites, and thus the initial months following transplantation, when seedlings are especially vulnerable to drought and animal damage, are a critical time for determining restoration success. To this end, we evaluated the survival, growth, and animal damage of 3600 native seedlings of 24 thornforest species in response to RIs incorporating a combination of seedling shelters and slow-release moisture, as well as a mycorrhizae-biostimulant admixture (MBS). We surveyed seedlings on a bi-monthly basis over one year following planting at a semi-arid upland site in the LRGV. We found that while shelters had a pronounced and lasting impact on height growth (increased by 15?27% on average), reduction of mortality by seedling shelter RIs was only modest (reduced on average by 5?12% per species), with significant benefits accruing from cocoon shelters only, which provide slow-release moisture to the seedling roots during the initial month after planting. Species-specific responses were the most variable, with mortality ranging from 8 to 69%. While shelters in some cases reduced mammalian herbivory, the growth of leggier stems and degradation of biodegradable shelters may reduce their overall efficacy. We conclude that thornforest restoration may be most effective when seedling performance is considered in species selection and costly restoration interventions are applied on species-specific basis. These results contribute an important first step towards optimizing forest restoration efforts in the LRGV on the basis of species identity and kickstart a species-specific database of seedling demographic responses in semiarid forest restoration.

AB  - Dung beetle activity causes many changes in the soil when they remove feces from the surface. In temperate grasslands and in greenhouse experiments, these changes have been found to positively affect established plants, but information about these effects under natural conditions in tropical forests is practically nonexistent. In a tropical rainforest (Los Tuxtlas, Mexico), we carried out field experiments with seedlings of six tree species (Brosimum alicastrum, Calophyllum brasiliense, Cymbopetalum baillonii, Diospyros digyna, Omphalea oleifera, and Poulsenia armata), to assess whether feces burial by dung beetles had any positive effect on them. We estimated foliar nitrogen and phosphorus, seedling survival, growth and resource allocation, under three treatment levels: (a) feces added and beetles active, (b) feces added and beetles excluded, and (c) no feces added (and consequently no beetles active). We analyzed data at two levels: community (all plant species together) and individual species. Dung beetle activity did not increase the concentration of foliar nutrients or seedling performance (survival, growth); in one species, it modified resource allocation. At the community level and for two species, dung beetle activity decreased the probability of seedlings growing in height. Our study provides evidence on how extrapolating the effects of dung beetle activity from other study systems into tropical forests can be problematic. More studies will be needed before we can have a clearer idea of the effects that feces burial by dung beetles have on established plants in tropical forests.

AB  - Although widely studied in grassland and forest ecosystems, dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), an important form of nitrogen (N) lost through leaching, has received little attention in cropland ecosystem research. A global literature review and partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) were adopted to assess the quantity and composition of N leaching loss under different cropping systems, soil types, and management practices, as well as to identify the major factors controlling DON leaching. Annual total dissolved nitrogen (TDN, organic + inorganic N) leaching under different cropping systems ranged from 4.0 to 383.2 kg N ha(-1). Vegetable and rice production systems showed the greatest and least TDN leaching, respectively. Across different cropping systems, DON accounted for 4.7%-34.9% of TDN in leachate. The NH4+-N form of N leaching is negligible in most upland cropping systems (<2.3%), but not so in lowland rice systems. The largest ratio of DON leaching to TDN leaching was found in a rice-wheat rotation (34.9%). Catch crop slightly increased DON leaching; however, it greatly decreased TDN leaching. Cropping systems in which animal manure or plant compost was applied or lowland rice was included showed a relatively high DON leaching ratio. Accordingly, in investigating DON leaching, more attention should be focused on cropping systems with manure application or lowland rice systems. Compared with climatic conditions and soil properties, field management practices (irrigation, chemical N input, and manure amendments) proved to be the factors most strongly influencing DON leaching. This suggests that optimizing water and N management practices is the most effective way of reducing the risk of DON leaching and increasing N use efficiency, particularly for vegetable and rice production systems.

AB  - The data was collected in the Karagwe and Kyerwa districts of the Kagera region in north-west Tanzania. It encompasses 150 smallholder farming households, which were interviewed on the composition of their household, agricultural production and use of organic farm waste. The data covers the two previous rainy seasons and the associated vegetation periods between September 2016 and August 2017. The knowledge of experts from the following institutions was included in the discussion on the selection criteria: two local non-profit organisations, i.e., WOMEDA and the MAVUNO Project; the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA); and the National Land Use Planning Commission (NLUPC). Households were selected for inclusion if all of the following applied to them: 1) less than 10 acres of land (4.7 ha) registered in the village offices, 2) no agricultural training, and 3) decline in the fertility of their land since they started farming (self-reported). We selected 150 smallholder households out of a pool of 5,000 households known to WOMEDA in six divisions of the Kyerwa and Karagwe districts. The questionnaire contained 54 questions. The original language of the survey was Kiswahili. All interviews were audio recorded. The answers were digitalised and translated into English. The data set contains the raw data with 130 quantitative and qualitative variables. For quantitative variables, the only analysis that was made was the conversion of units, e.g., land area was converted from acres to hectares, harvest from buckets to kilograms and then to tons, and heads of livestock to Tropical Livestock Units (TLU). Qualitative variables were summarised into categories. All data has been anonymised. The data set includes geographical variables, household information, agricultural information, gender-specific responsibilities, economic data, farm waste management, and water, energy and food availability (Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus). Variables are written in italics. The following geographical variables are part of the data set: district, division, ward, village, hamlet, longitude, latitude, and altitude. Household information includes start of farming, household size, gender and age of household members. Agricultural information includes land size, size of homegarden, crops, livestock and livestock keeping, trees, and access to forest. Gender-specific responsibilities includes producing and exchanging seeds, weed control, terracing, distributing organic material to the fields, care of annual and perennial crops, harvesting of crops, decisions about the harvest and animal products, selling and buying products, working on their own farm and off-farm, cooking, storing food, collecting and caring for drinking water, washing, and toilet cleaning. Economic data includes distance to the market, journey time to market, transport methods, labourers employed by the household, working off-farm, and assets such as type of house. Variables relevant to the WEF Nexus are drinking water source and treatment, meals per day, months without food, cooking fuel, and type of toilet. Variables on farm waste management are the use of crop residues, food and kitchen waste, livestock manure, cooking ash, animal bones, and human urine and faeces. The data can be potentially reused and further developed for the purpose of agricultural production analysis, socio-economic analysis, comparison to other regions, conceptualisation of waste and nutrient management, establishment of land use concepts, and further analysis on food security and healthy diets.

AB  - Runoff from farm roadways within farm boundaries are acknowledged as a year-round source of pollutants discharging to surface water, particularly during the main grazing season (Feb-Nov) when their usage is high. These losses are considered to be a significant catchment scale pressure and have led to recent legislation in Ireland to prohibit direct runoff from farm roadways to waters with similar guidance in the UK and New Zealand. However, roadway runoff (RR) remains an undocumented and understudied part of the transfer continuum where knowledge gaps remain in relation to its quantity and composition and in relation to the impacts of RR management options on adjacent surface waters. Indeed some information on mitigation measure design and efficacy is only available from non-agriculture land uses e.g. forestry and needs to be presented in a farm specific context. The present review brings together knowledge on RR in terms of content on- or off-roadway management options and proposes alternative mitigation measures that may require pilot scale testing. Studies show that RR contains a mix of legacy (surface materials) and incidental (fresh urine and faeces) constituents such as phosphorus (P), Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and sediment which become temporarily mobilised during rainfall events. Once mobilised, the roadway network can quickly transport pollutants providing connectivity between farmyards, hard standings, underpasses where attached to a watercourse, fields and even public roadways to watercourses. Its contents are not dissimilar to dilute slurry or dairy soiled water with loads being highest where animals congregate (within 100 m of the farmyard or where roadway configuration or quality impedes stock movement along the network). On-roadway management options include regularly spaced diversion structures that divert runoff for passive treatment in a field or drainage ditch or the application of chemical amendments to roadway surfaces. Off-roadway options can include natural or enhanced features, which attenuate flow leading to settlement of suspended sediment and in some cases treatment of a percentage of the load before delivery to a watercourse. It should be noted that the options presented in this review need to be retrofitted to site specific conditions. Therefore, a number of factors, including their effectiveness, cost and management needs on a particular farm, as well as local regulation requirements will need to be considered prior to implementation. Therefore, only the measures that divert RR away from waters are applicable to Ireland. Future research should develop and validate a farm roadway risk assessment tool to identify vulnerable roadway sections that need management and/or re-design, and identify means of incorporating RR into catchment scale risk assessment models. In addition, design of on- and off-RR management options should consider the wide variations in farm configuration and management with regard to size, topography, soil type/drainage class, enterprise, intensity, scale, stage of development and the potential impacts of climate change.

AB  - This account describes the context, history and outcomes of a series of studies into the ecology of slash-and-burn (S-B) agriculture in the world's humid tropics. These studies, which began in the mid-1980s, identified promising lines of research and continued to field trials, in Central America, of candidate agricultural systems as possible sustainable alternatives to the practice. The only system to emerge from 7 years' comparative trial with any promise of sustainability, in this context, was the agroforestry technique known as alley-cropping; but only with trees of the genus Inga. Inga alley-cropping then underwent field trials with subsistence farming families in northern Honduras. The system was aimed at the twin objectives of achieving food security in basic grains, on minimal inputs, and of providing the means of eliminating further S-B in the region. Since then, Inga alley-cropping has become the heart of a sustainable and integrated rural livelihood model (the Guama Model) which is being implemented successfully in northern Honduras with some 300 families. These families had been attempting to subsist on a few hectares of land degraded by decades or centuries of S-B. The development of Inga alley-cropping, supplemented by rock phosphate and other mineral supplements, as a sustainable subsistence and cash crop alternative means that land previously being held in reserve for subsequent S-B operations can now be planted to permanent forms of agroforestry. Entire landscapes can be re-greened by productive agroforest vegetation. Achieving this at scale will require the investment of huge extension effort and funds. However, the environmental, social and economic returns are also huge; and they are sustainable. In this programme,we are seeing the vitality and goodwill of hundreds of families focussed on the raising, planting and management of trees in ways that feed the living organisms of the soil and, hence, feed themselves. In so cheerfully planting out their own futures, they plant and reshape the future of their own country. Replicating this at scale, as Rattan Lal outlines below, could reshape the future of this planet. In the mid-1980s, progress on sustainable alternatives to S-B, especially in rain forests, was frustrated by a lack of conclusiveness in the literature as to why soil fertility fails so rapidly post-burn; but also by a degree of contradiction on the impacts of the burn on certain plant nutrients. Hands (Hands 1988 The ecology of shifting cultivation. MSc thesis, University of Cambridge) concentrated on the role of soil phosphorus and attempted to resolve these contradictions. The Cambridge Alley-cropping Projects (1988-2002) continued this theme and threw light on the question of sustainable food production in rain forest environments.

AB  - Soil is considered as a non-renewable resource, which may be lost in sloping land more rapidly than it is formed thus leading to loss of fertility and ecosystem deterioration. We hypothesized that earthworms could counteract this process due to their cast forming activity. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the production of casts in small plots of 0.25 m(2) established in three vegetation units (woodland, shrubland and meadow) in a catchment of 46 ha for 2.5 years in relation to their (micro-) pedoclimatic conditions. We also assessed the impact of cast formation on water runoff and soil detachment. Moreover, we quantified the mass of casts deposited in the entire catchment on a regular grid of 50 m and we measured soil erosion at the outlet of the catchment.
   Our results showed a high and variable production of casts (from 16 to 219 t ha(-1) year depending on vegetation, season and year. The mass of casts found in the entire catchment represented on average 7.4 t ha(-1) with an annual production rate of 35 t ha(-1). Since the annual erosion rate measured for the entire catchment (3 t ha(-1) year was much lower than the cast production rate, our results indicated that most of the soil bioturbated by earthworms remained in the catchment. Indeed, water runoff and soil detachment measured in small plots showed that casts were not transported in the water runoff but degraded by raindrop impacts with the material remaining at the place of deposition. This process led to the generating of a new soil horizon at the culmination point of the catchment of up to 6.5 cm after 2.5 years. We conclude that the surface activity of anecic earthworms could influence soil generation at scale and conteract the effects of soil erosion.

AB  - In degraded grasslands, luxuriant growth and rapid expansion of poisonous plants threaten livestock safety and reduce forage quality. Most of the poisonous plants propagate through seeds, but previous studies have paid insufficient attention to seed ecology, leading to a lack of sufficient support for ecological research regarding the formulation and implementation of relevant prevention and control methods. Based on a review of 172 references (1933-2020), we have summarized the research on soil seed banks, seed germination and dormancy, and seed dispersal of poisonous plants in the world's grasslands. The plants involved are Euphorbia esula, Eupatorium adenophorum, Lantana camara, Stellera chamaejasme, Achnatherum inebrians, genera of Senecio, Delphinium, Cicuta, Aconitum, Lupinus, Halogeton, and locoweed, which refers specifically to a kind of poisonous plants of Astragalus and Oxytropis genus containing swainsonine. There are some commonalities in the seed ecology of different poisonous plants in grasslands, including the persistence and surface aggregation of soil seed banks, as well as primary, long-distance dispersal by wind and animals. However, there are many differences between poisonous plants in terms of soil seed density, preference conditions of seed germination, seed dispersal media, and distance. For controlling the spread of poisonous plant seeds must reduce the disturbance to the surface soil and prohibit grazing during the active stage of seed rain. We recommend future studies investigate the influence of grazing on seed germination and propagation, the formation and fall of seed rain, and the impact of global change on poisonous plants. This review will be helpful for grassland researchers and managers in the study of seed ecology and the control strategy of poisonous plants.

AB  - The bottom-up effects of vegetation have been documented to be strong drivers of the soil food web structure and functioning in temperate forests. However, how the forest type affects the stability of the soil food web is not well known. In the Ziwuling forest region of the Loess Plateau, we selected three typical forests, Pinus tabuliformis Carriere (PT), Betula platyphylla Sukaczev (BP), and Quercus liaotungensis Koidz. (QL), to investigate the soil nematode community characteristics in the dry (April) and rainy (August) season, and analyzed their relationships with the soil properties. The results showed that the characteristics of the soil nematode communities and their seasonal variations differed markedly among the forest types. Compared to P. tabuliformis (PT), the B. platyphylla (BP) and Q. liaotungensis (QL) forests had higher plant diversity and more easily decomposed litters, which were more effective for improving the soil resource availability, thus, leading to more beneficial effects on the soil nematode community. In both the dry and rainy season, the soil nematode abundance was the highest in the BP forest. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), Pielou's evenness index (J'), and nematode channel ratio index (NCR) were higher, while the Simpson dominance index (lambda) and plant parasite index (PPI) were lower, in the BP and QL forests compared with in the PT forest. From the dry to rainy season, the total nematode abundance and the abundance of fungivores, bacterivores, and omnivore-predators, significantly increased in the QL and PT forests, and the values of the Wasilewska index (WI), maturity index (MI), H', J', lambda, and NCR showed the most significant seasonal variability in the PT forest, which were mainly driven by changes in the soil labile C and N and the moisture content between the two seasons. Generally, the seasonal stability of the soil nematode communities was the highest in the BP forest and the poorest in the PT forest, probably due to variations in the plant diversity. Our results suggest the importance of tree species and diversity as bottom-up regulating factors of the soil food web structure, function, and seasonal stability, which has important implications for sustainable forest management in the Loess Plateau and other temperate regions.

AB  - EVERY WINTER AND SPRING, RAINS ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. COMBINE WITH snowmelt along the northern reaches of the Mississippi River to inundate the hardwood-dominated bottomlands of the lower Mississippi. When the floodwaters recede and soils dry up in summer, logging crews move in. One of their targets has been swamp ash. These wetland trees have thin-walled cells with large gaps between them, creating a low-density wood-and some say a special sound-that has made it the material of choice for some of the most famous guitar players in rock and roll.

AB  - Gradual change is prevalent across the forest landscape and generates long-lasting effects for the landscape surface; thus, tracking long-term gradual change can effectively characterize forest change processes. The objective of this study was to establish a vegetation index for change monitoring so as to determine long-term gradual change processes of forest ecosystems in typical red soil areas. The study area was located in Hengyang City, Hunan Province, China. Landsat images, field survey, and auxiliary data were collected to devise a disturbance sensitive vegetation index (DSVI) as an indicator of forest change. Long-term (1985-2019) forest changes were detected using the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE), while three evaluation aspects of velocity, frequency, and variance were used to analyze the processes of forest gradual change in red soil regions. Results indicate that the DSVI is a suitable index for forest change detection due to its stronger sensitivity compared to other indexes. Further, it shows excellent change detection ability for different types of gradual changes, such as those caused by drought and significant soil erosion. Furthermore, 97.26% of the forests showed gradual change, and approximately 2/3 of monitored forests showed an increasing growth trend while 1/3 showed a decreasing trend. The dominant (28.33%) forest disturbance frequency indicated instability in red soil regions. Dispersion degree of forest variance was mainly low (48.46%) or medium (28.84%). This research establishes the DSVI as a promising method to track forest gradual change and contributes to a better understanding of gradual change processes of forest landscape over time.

AB  - In forest management and science it is important to determine the drivers of tree growth and to quantify their relative importance with regard to forest site characteristics. The growth of individual trees depends on complex interactions of biotic and environmental drivers. Controlling the influence of biotic drivers (e.g. interspecific competition and bark beetles) is the main concern of forest management. However, large uncertainties emerge from environmental drivers and their impacts on tree growth. The aim of this study is to quantify the relative importance of environmental drivers (climate, soil, and terrain attributes) on the growth of Norway spruce trees (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). For that purpose, the relative basal area increment of individual spruce trees was modelled with a Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) approach. The approach is particularly suitable, since BRT quantify the relative predictor importance, taking nonlinearities and predictor variable interactions into consideration. We assume distinct differences in the growth responses to environmental drivers on three main soil unit classes (cambisol, podzol and waterlogged soils) in Saxony and Thuringia, Germany. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the importance of soil properties (available water capacity and sand content of the soil) on the growth of Norway spruce trees. Terrain attributes and water availability are crucial for Norway spruce growth on cambisol, podzol and waterlogged soils. Moreover, interactions among environmental drivers are more relevant on sites with cambisol as compared to podzol or waterlogged soils. Considering interactions between environmental drivers in the model led to significant differences in the identification of important environmental drivers. This observation was consistent among soil unit classes, especially for environmental drivers associated with water availability. Thus, the implementation of the results in growth models of high spatial resolution will support decision making in forest management, e.g. through identifying proper regions for spruce development and risk control.

AB  - The environment of a large-scale vegetable production area can be exposed to antibiotic residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) via animal manure and irrigation with contaminated water, which can facilitate the dissemination of ARB. However, the occurrence of ARB in plantation areas and their dissemination in this environment remain largely unexplored. In total, 382 samples including those from vegetable (n = 106), soil (n = 87), well water (n = 24), river water (n = 20), river sediments (n = 20), farmer feces (n = 58) and farmer hands (n = 67) were collected in 2019 from a large-scale cultivation area in Shandong, China. Selective agar plates were used to screen for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and whole-genome sequencing and Southern blotting were used to characterise isolates and mobile genetic elements carrying carbapenem resistance determinants. A total of nine NDM-5-producing isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Citrobacter spp. were identified from environmental sources and human feces, all of which were multidrug-resistant. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis suggested clonal transmission of carbapenem-resistant Citrobacter sedlakii within greenhouse soils in the area. Eight of the isolates carried closely related or identical IncX3 plasmids carrying bla(NDM-5), which were shown to be conjugative via filter mating experiments, indicating the highly transmissible nature of this genetic element. Isolates of E. coli and Citrobacter freundii were detected in the feces of local farm workers and contained similar IncX3 plasmids with bla(NDM-5) environmental isolates, suggesting a potential risk of CRE transfer from the work environment to the farm workers. Thus, further research is required to investigate the potential health risks associated with environmental exposure to CRE in vegetable cultivation areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Western Ghats of India, the soil properties, particularly Atterberg limits, are of relevance to the landslides. Pedogenic processes in the Western Ghats and plateaus on it are regulated by parent materials, relief (topography), organisms, climate, and time. In this study, the five major soils found within the mid-part of the Western Ghats in the Idukki district of Kerala, Southern India was analyzed for elucidating physical, chemical, and geotechnical properties (Atterberg limits) on landslides potentiality or slope failure processes. The result reveals that the highly weathered lateritic soils noted with lower KCl pH (3.6-4.6), low-cation exchange capacity (3.1 to 19.6 cmol( +) kg(-1)), low-effective cation exchange capacity (0.8 to 10.7 cmol( +) kg(-1)) and a negative increment pH value indicate the presence of variable charge minerals such as amorphous sesquioxides. The variable ranking of random forest revealed that the soil Atterberg limits were significantly influenced by Citrate Bicarbonate Dithionite (CBD) iron, sand fractions, and organic carbon. The layer of porous sandy soils showed lower Atterberg limits due to accentuate with clay matter, whereas the illuvial layer (Bt) have noted as higher Atterberg limits that lead to potentially collapsing gullies or triggering mass movement during heavy rainfall followed by intensive runoff due to instability of soil mass within proxy of the steeply sloping surface. Soil geotechnical properties such as liquid limit, plastic limit, and plasticity index are the main characteristics that decide the slope stability and failure in various parts of the study area, whereas the soil profile morphometry has significantly associated with the occurrence of landslides with the plastic limit value between 28.01 and 40.48. It was noticed that the failed slopes have a higher value than stable slopes along with the hill-range topography, with soil particle sizes range of silt and clay (8.79 to 36.17 and 22.31 to 57.74%) with the measurement of liquid limit (40.05 to 68.4), plastic limit (24.2 to 43.94), and plasticity index (7.81 to 24.8). This indicates that the pedogenesis of the weathering profile of soils have significantly influenced the Atterberg limits that triggering slope failure or landslides along the gullies and weathered lateritic uplands.

AB  - The cyanobacterial genus Nostoc is an important contributor to carbon and nitrogen bioavailability in terrestrial ecosystems and a frequent partner in symbiotic relationships with non- diazotrophic organisms. However, since this currently is a polyphyletic genus, the diversity of Nostoc- like cyanobacteria is considerably underestimated at this moment. While reviewing the phylogenetic placement of previously isolated Nostoc- like cyanobacteria originating from Brazilian Amazon, Caatinga and Atlantic forest samples, we detected 17 strains isolated from soil, freshwater, rock and tree surfaces presenting patterns that diverged significantly from related strains when ecological, morphological, molecular and genomic traits were also considered. These observations led to the identification of the evaluated strains as representative of three novel nostocacean genera and species: Amazonocrinis nigriterrae gen. nov., sp. nov.; Atlanticothrix silvestris gen. nov., sp. nov.; and Dendronalium phyllosphericum gen. nov., sp. nov., which are herein described according to the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants. This finding highlights the great importance of tropical and equatorial South American ecosystems for harbouring an unknown microbial diversity in the face of the anthropogenic threats with which they increasingly struggle.

AB  - Throughout history, reservoirs have played a fundamental role in economic development. Darns transform landscapes, however, and create risks of irreversible impacts. Research on the environmental, social, and economic impacts is concentrated on large reservoirs, even though small reservoirs prevail in the landscape. In the Guariroba watershed a large reservoir has been created to supply the city of Campo Grande. Small reservoirs in the watershed have not yet been mapped or their environmental impacts analyzed. This work aimed to map the small reservoirs in the Guariroba watershed, and to analyze the associated environmental impacts, to generate information that can help with the planning and management of anthropic activities. The mapping was performed in a GIS using high spatial resolution satellite images available in World Imagery of ArcMap and historical images from Google Earth. For validation mapping, spectral indices of the dry (2019) and rainy (2020) season, were generated with images from the Sentinel-2A satellite. Sixty-six small reservoirs created by the construction of earth darns in natural watercourses have been mapped, located predominantly in the drainage headwaters, and 119 reservoirs in wetlands, mainly the riverine. Some of the mapped reservoirs did not have stored water, both in the dry and rainy periods. In the drainage headwaters, most of the springs were degraded, with exposed soil, mud sliding and the absence of surrounding Forest vegetation. Many reservoirs, used for animal drinking and fish farming, in riverside wetlands are also in the process of environmental degradation.

AB  - The Mearim River Watershed has multiple uses e.g. leisure, navigation, fishing and subsistence agriculture and constitutes the main source of supply for the populations of municipalities situated along its course. In addition to being a water supply source, the existence of the 'pororoca' (tidal bore) effect in a stretch of the lower course of the Mearim River attracts people from several Brazilian states and different countries, as it offers excellent conditions for surfing in fresh water. In this respect, given the importance of the watershed, this study was developed to report the detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli pathotypes in a stretch of the lower course of the Mearim River, located in the state of Maranhao, Brazil. Thirty water samples were collected from 10 sampling points. To quantify E. coli, the chromogenic enzymatic system was used and positive samples were isolated and biochemically identified. Pure cultures underwent DNA extraction by heating followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) characterization. At the time of the collections, an observation schedule was used to record information on the existence of rearing of livestock and domestic animals; businesses; residences; and fruit and vegetable farming on the riverbanks. The samples were analyzed for the mean populations of E. coli, which ranged from 444 to 2,585 MPN mL(-1). Twenty bacterial isolates were identified and the diarrheal pathotypes ETEC, typical EPEC and atypical EPEC were detected. The detection of these pathotypes can represent an epidemiological risk and compromise several uses of this water resource, such as irrigation of fruits and vegetables consumed raw, fishing, animal watering and recreation. Structural investments in basic sanitation are essential to minimize environmental degradation resulting from anthropic activities and to act preventively in public health. In addition, the recovery of riparian forests along the watershed and the maintenance of vegetation in these areas are measures to reduce the transport of particles from the soil to the watercourses, improving the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of this water resource.

AB  - ForestGEO is a network of scientists and long-term forest dynamics plots (FDPs) spanning the Earth's major forest types. ForestGEO's mission is to advance understanding of the diversity and dynamics of forests and to strengthen global capacity for forest science research. ForestGEO is unique among forest plot networks in its large-scale plot dimensions, censusing of all stems >= 1 cm in diameter, inclusion of tropical, temperate and boreal forests, and investigation of additional biotic (e.g., arthropods) and abiotic (e.g., soils) drivers, which together provide a holistic view of forest functioning. The 71 FDPs in 27 countries include approximately 7.33 million living trees and about 12,000 species, representing 20% of the world's known tree diversity. With >1300 published papers, ForestGEO researchers have made significant contributions in two fundamental areas: species coexistence and diversity, and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, defining the major biotic and abiotic controls on the distribution and coexistence of species and functional types and on variation in species' demography has led to improved understanding of how the multiple dimensions of forest diversity are structured across space and time and how this diversity relates to the processes controlling the role of forests in the Earth system. Nevertheless, knowledge gaps remain that impede our ability to predict how forest diversity and function will respond to climate change and other stressors. Meeting these global research challenges requires major advances in standardizing taxonomy of tropical species, resolving the main drivers of forest dynamics, and integrating plot-based ground and remote sensing observations to scale up estimates of forest diversity and function, coupled with improved predictive models. However, they cannot be met without greater financial commitment to sustain the long-term research of ForestGEO and other forest plot networks, greatly expanded scientific capacity across the world's forested nations, and increased collaboration and integration among research networks and disciplines addressing forest science.

AB  - Water is the main and irreplaceable need for living things, both plants, animals and humans. Springs are one of the important elements, especially in the dry season, for the survival of living things, especially humans. The availability of water can play a role in many aspects including being able to function as drinking water, bathing, latrines (MCK), washing, plantations and livestock, irrigation of agricultural land, the need to purify oneself (as a support for the implementation of worship), and the economy. Conservation of springs through programmed reforestation activities in spring water catchment areas such as those carried out by the community and the NTB government requires precise references, so it is necessary to study the relationship or role between vegetation, soil (land) and climate in the conservation of spring sources. This research was conducted in Lingsar village, Lingsar District with quantitative research methods, namely observing vegetation directly in the field in the Kemalik Lingsar spring catchment area. Field data were then analyzed to determine the stratification, diversity, structure and composition of vegetation in the study area. The structure and composition of vegetation is carried out by calculating the density, frequency, dominance and importance of each species. Based on the research results it can be concluded that the number of tree species found in Kemalik is 14 species. Mangosteen is the dominant species with an IVI value of 104% and a density of 125 ph / ha. Utilization of land in the Kemaliq spring is mangosteen-based agroforestry which has been carried out for a long time, which can be seen from the old mangosteen trees which are planted at regular intervals and arrangements and are maintained (the community has long contributed to efforts to conserve soil and water). Underplants found in Kemalik were 16 species of herbaceous, 13 species of shrubs and saplings

AB  - Microbial water quality monitoring is an essential component of food safety. E. coli bacterium is the major indicator organism used in assessing microbial water quality but dense sampling of water to assess spatial variability is impractical. The objective of this work was to test the hypothesis that sUAS imaging can provide information about the differences in E. coli habitats across two Maryland irrigation ponds and guide water sampling. We used modified GoPro cameras and a MicaSense RedEdge camera in flights shortly before sampling. Ponds P1 (0.37ha) and P2 (0.48ha) were sampled from a boat in the same locations, biweekly, during the 2018 growing season. Average concentrations of E. coli were 0.60 +/- 0.04 and 1.04 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- st. error, log CFU/100 mL) in P1 and P2, respectively. The random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was applied to relate ground sampling data with co-located image sections. The sensitivity of results to parameters of the RF algorithm was assessed with multiple scenarios. The most influential parameters for both ponds were maximum tree depth and minimum leaf size. The maximum R-2 values in predictions of E. coli concentrations were 0.941 (0.943) and 0.532(0.565) in training and validation datasets, respectively, for pond P1 (P2). The most influential inputs for both ponds were red, blue, and green obtained after demosaicing images in the visible range, while P1 included red and blue obtained after demosaicing infrared images. Overall, accurate estimation of E. coli concentrations from imagery data is possible and benefits from tuning algorithm control parameters.

AB  - The dual layers of Nano-membranes barrier, could succeeded in regulation nutrient element and control water-borne disease by improving aerations through added dual layers of nano-membranes, this plantation model provide concept of providing hydrophilic properties and 500 nm pore size believed to be much precision tools for agricultural utilization. This rebuilding of pineapple cultivation was optimized in green-house with natural ventilation, Optimized humidity and free watering were properly practiced by implement of diffusion cage for a novel revealed boundary effect by 500 nm mold inject product. Effect indicated as indicated: Cellulose, PBT, CTA in sequence have better boundary effects over limiting the diffusion of nitrate, phosphate, and a small part of potassium in the root boundary regime through proper moisture with 0.5-0.8 L/pot button irrigation, The intensity of boundary effect were revealed in kinetic analysis follow in sequence: EC (1500 mg L-1) >> nitrate (300 mg L-1) > TPO (2.5 mg L-1), while highly fluctuate for TPO. Then indication of hydrophilic PBT was better than PP was verified in barrier model. In the growth stage, separate initial I-III for direct releasing from the fertilizer and III-VI for hydrolysis & secretion of nutrient, especially for TPO anion form, indicate highly ion charged or polar attraction exerted. While phosphate was delivered slowly, the organic practice was found promising in deliver and uptake to the final two or three stage for flowering and fruiting. The verification of deliver of nutrient by double caged box in the rhigime zone, indicated effective in lowered the damping off/nematode syndrome, which opened the extension cropping in suboptimal area for pineapples. The success of growth character improved by control disease and pest, reach complete maturation. Under 80 % of final fruiting, the balance analysis show consistence in expectation for Pya (wild) > Pyc (hybrid) > Pyb (interbreed).

AB  - In-situ measurements of tree sap flow enable the analysis of derived forest transpiration and also the water state of the entire ecosystem. The process of water transport (by sap flow) and transpiration through vegetation organisms are strongly influenced by the synergistic effect of numerous external factors, some of which are predicted to alter due to climate change. The study was carried out by in-situ monitoring sap flow and related environmental factors in the years 2014 and 2015 on a research plot in Bienska dolina (Slovakia). We evaluated the relationship between derived transpiration of the adult beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest stand, environmental conditions, and soil water deficit. Seasonal beech transpiration (from May to September) achieved 59% of potential evapotranspiration (PET) in 2014 and 46% in 2015. Our study confirmed that soil water deficit leads to a radical limitation of transpiration and fundamentally affects the relationship between transpiration and environmental drivers. The ratio of transpiration (E) against PET was significantly affected by a deficit of soil water and in dry September 2015 decreased to the value of 0.2. The maximum monthly value (0.8) of E/PET was recorded in August and September 2014. It was demonstrated that a time lag exists between the course of transpiration and environmental factors on a diurnal basis. An application of the time lags within the analysis increased the strength of the association between transpiration and the variables. However, the length of these time lags changed in conditions of soil drought (on average by 25 min). Transpiration is driven by energy income and connected evaporative demand, provided a sufficient amount of extractable soil water. A multiple regression model constructed from measured global radiation (R-S), air temperature (AT), and air humidity (RH) explained 69% of the variability in beech stand transpiration (entire season), whereas (R-S) was the primary driving force. The same factors that were shifted in time explained 73% of the transpiration variability. Cross-correlation analysis of data measured in time without water deficit demonstrated a tighter dependency of transpiration (E) on environmental drivers shifted in time (-60 min R-S, +40 min RH and +20 min vapour pressure deficit against E). Due to an occurrence and duration of soil water stress, the dependence of transpiration on the environmental variables became weaker, and at the same time, the time lags were prolonged. Hence, the course of transpiration lagged behind the course of global radiation by 60 (R-2 = 0.76) and 80 (R-2 = 0.69) minutes in conditions without and with water deficit, respectively.

AB  - Agricultural communities in the Himalayas are especially vulnerable to the shocks of climate change. An improved understanding of how residents perceive changes to climate and agroecosystems is critical to creating and implementing locally appropriate adaptation strategies. In this study, we administered a questionnaire to 251 residents within 16 villages in and adjacent to the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS), a culturally and ecologically important area in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The study area is rugged and remote, and the resource-dependent communities are among the least-studied of the region. Using the questionnaire, we investigated how residents perceive changes to climate and agroecosystems, how households are adapting, and whether perceptions and adaptations differ by demographic and livelihood factors. We used both quantitative (summary statistics, t-tests, and chi square tests) and qualitative strategies (interpretation of open-ended responses) to analyze the questionnaire results. A majority of respondents perceived an increase in many variables including flash flood/landslide events, total annual rainfall, average summer temperature, agricultural pests, crop failure, and crop raiding by wild animals. In most cases, perceptions did not vary by demographic or livelihood factors. However, larger landholders were more likely to perceive an increase in intense rain/snow, average annual rainfall, and wildlife sightings in fields. Most respondents reported that they were not adapting or planning to adapt to change. However, a few reported adaptation strategies such as changing crops and planting vegetation to stabilize soil, as well as pesticide use. Respondents believed that to effectively adapt they need assistance from outside institutions. Locally based (panchayat) and state-level institutions were ranked as very helpful for adaptation, but the Forest Department, Government of India, and NGOs received lower rankings. Overall, the respondents demonstrated a high level of agreement in their perceptions of change and barriers to adaptation. The broad consensus among residents offers an important opportunity for consensus building and collaboration with local and national institutions. The study has implications for collaborative public works and research projects which can help to build trust, develop locally-appropriate adaptation strategies, reduce conflict with wild animals, share insights, and increase the visibility of local knowledge about climate and agroecosystems. Furthermore, the study illustrates how understanding the perceptions and insights of agricultural communities around protected areas can inform adaptation at the ground level.

AB  - Long-term land use/land cover (LULC) assessments, based on remote-sensing data, play a leading role in gathering information on land degradation that has an impact on food security, soil quality and species habitats with all the accompanying social implications. The aim of this study was to determine the LULC changes of severely degraded land using high-resolution remote-sensing data from the last similar to 50 years in order to determine whether human activities have led to improvements or further land degradation. An area of 70 km(2) near Cherrapunji in Northeast India, which receives 11,000 mm of rainfall annually and was deforested in historical times, was selected for this analysis. Despite severe land degradation, the population density of this area has been continuously increasing, standing at similar to 300 inhabitants km(-2) in 2011. A visual interpretation technique, combined with field surveys, was used for LULC mapping, based on satellite images from the US Corona programme for 1965, pansharpened Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) images IRS-1D for 1998 and Google Earth for 2017. This analysis indicated the dominance of grassland (73.2%), with a small contribution of forest (17.6%), settlements (5.8%), mining (2.3%), cropland (0.7%) and water bodies (0.4%) in 2017. The LULC structure was the result of a largely degraded land contribution inherited from the past and the emergence of new driving forces behind landuse change. The LULC trends in 1965-2017 included a decrease of forest (4%) and grassland (5%), stability of cropland, and an increase of land-use classes which, in non-degraded land under a monsoonal climate, are usually of small extension, such as settlements (85%), mining (132%) and water bodies (525%). These changes reflect both, attempts to utilise existing environmental resources and to adapt to living in a degraded environment caused by growing human population. From the land degradation perspective, the trends in LULC change show two opposing directions--further land degradation mainly associated with the expansion of settlements and mining (accounting for similar to 79% of the total LULC changes), and land improvement and neutral change, including the recovery of natural vegetation and the construction of water bodies. The relationships between the LULC changes and direct measurements of biomass and carbon stocks of forest and grassland ecosystems indicated that their balance was negative for the Cherrapunji spur in 1965-2017. A strategy aimed at restoring the sustainability of the Cherrapunji spur environment should focus on the replacement of grassland by forest through the abandonment of uncontrolled grass burning, animal grazing and coal mining with the simultaneous provision of alternative gainful employment for the local population such as tourism and aquaculture.

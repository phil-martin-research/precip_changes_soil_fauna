AB  - The tree slenderness coefficient (TSC) serves as a simplified measure of tree stability, which is subject to the complex influences of climate, soil, diversity, and competition. Quantifying and exploiting the risks affecting the TSC facilitates the development of forest stability restoration measures. In the current climate change and multiple risk coexistence scenario, the interactions of risks are expected to have non-negligible effects on the TSC. However, past efforts have been limited to independent effects without interactive effects, which is detri-mental to a proper understanding of ecology. For example, the inconsistent effect direction of the same indicator on TSC in past studies may be due to the neglect of the interactive effects of the indicators. Natural secondary forests are effective mitigation tools for climate change that urgently need to be managed appropriately to maximize their stability and provide a wide range of benefits. Therefore, we conducted the first comprehensive investigation of both independent and interactive effects of climate, soil, diversity, and competition on TSC, utilizing data from 13,874 trees of three principal tree species distributed in Chinese boreal natural secondary forests. Further, simulation examples were provided to present actionable management measures using the improved insight. The results showed that short-wave solar radiation (Srad), cation exchange capacity (CEC), Pielou evenness index (Pielou), and basal area (BA) exerted positive independent influences on TSC, while mean annual precipitation (MAP) did the opposite. The significant interaction terms were BA x Pielou, BA x Srad, Pielou x CEC, and Srad x CEC, all of which showed positive effects on TSC. In addition, the interactions pro-duced non-negligible forces on the TSC, especially for small-sized trees, as the relative importance was quite large. Importantly, the effect directions of the indicators on the TSC were inconstant and changed with the gradients of other indicators due to the presence of interactions. Finally, the simulation results showed that tree stability in 97.1% of the plots was negatively affected by Srad or CEC, which could be transformed into positive effects by adjusting BA or Pielou above the critical points. This research offers a novel insight into the importance of interactions in credible TSC modeling and indicator analysis, which may hopefully serve as a beginning to guide forest management based on tree stability while faced with environmental change.

AB  - Urban expansion and associated habitat transformation drives shifts in biodiversity, with declines in taxonomic and functional diversity. Forests fragments within urban landscapes offer a number of ecosystem services, and help to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we focus on a tropical forest environment, and on the soil biota. Using eDNA metabarcoding, we compare forest fragments within the city of Cayenne, French Guiana, with a neighbouring continuous undisturbed forest. We wished to determine if urban forest fragments conserve high levels of alpha and beta diversity as well as similar functional composition for plants, soil animals, fungi and bacteria. We found that alpha diversity is similar across habitats for plants and fungi, lower in urban forests for metazoans and higher for bacteria. We also found that urban forests communities differ from undisturbed forests in their taxonomic composition, with urban forests exhibiting greater turnover between fragments potentially caused by ecological drift and limited dispersal. However, their functional composition exhibited limited differences, with an enrichment of palms, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria and a depletion of climber plants and termites. Thus, although urban forest fragments do shelter soil biodiversity that differs from native forests, the losses of soil functions may be relatively limited. This study demonstrates the strong potential of a multi-taxa eDNA approach for rapid inventories across taxonomic kingdoms, in particular for cryptic soil diversity. It also demonstrates the key role of urban forest fragments in conserving biodiversity and ecosystem function, and points to a need for more systematic monitoring of these areas in urban management plans.

AB  - The Araucaria forest is a sub-type of Atlantic Forest and it is critically endangered because of deforestation. Despite significant researchers' attention, little is known about the microbial and functional soil diversity of this ecosystem. Our aim was to assess structural diversity (phospholipid fatty acid; PLFA), functional diversity (Biolog ecoplates) and physicochemical soil properties to identify which indicators are the most sensitive to alterations in the Araucaria ecosystems. Soils of three different areas (disturbed, reforested, and native Araucaria forest soils), in two parks of Southeast Brazil, were collected in contrasting seasons (dry and rainy). Principal components analysis (PCA) showed that fatty acid profiles, Biolog and physicochemical properties in Araucaria forest soils were more dissimilar between the different park geographic locations than by forest disturbance levels. However, discriminant analysis identified several variables with greater power to discriminate among forest disturbance levels (native, disturbed, and reforested) within each season. Reforested soils were lower in pH, Al+3, and base cation content compared to disturbed and native soils. Soils disturbed by recreational and understory deforestation were sandier in texture and elevated in P compared to native and deforested soils. Native soil microbial communities utilized certain Biolog substrates to a greater extent, depending on season, compared to communities of disturbed and reforested soils. The best discriminating variable among native, disturbed, and reforested soils for both seasons was gamma-hydroxybutyric acid consumption, which was positively related to native, and negatively correlated to disturbed and reforested soils. Thus, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid consumption may be a useful indicator to monitor the recovery of reforested and disturbed Araucaria soils in reference to its native state.

AB  - Reasons for the higher-than-expected soil and litter faunal diversity are still poorly understood - the so-called 'enigma of soil animal diversity' - especially regarding the extent of specialization of arthropod detritivores towards leaf-litter species. Here, we assess soil detritivorous arthropod diversity patterns in relation to eight, green leaf-litter species, in an old-growth, diverse southern Afrotemperate forest. Here, green leaves are often found scattered across the forest floors after turbulent weather, providing vital nutrients for ground-dwelling arthropods in a nutrient-poor system, possibly selecting for specialization. Litter bags containing speciesspecific green leaf litter of common southern Afrotemperate trees were placed in five forests. We found no evidence that leaf-litter species support unique detritivore assemblages, except for one species, nor did we find differences in richness between leaf-litter species. Significant differences in arthropod abundance were noted between some leaf-litter species, which did not relate to patterns for leaf-litter decomposition. Therefore, we support the hypothesis that ground-dwelling, detritivore arthropods are largely generalist towards leaf-litter species. Additionally, we demonstrate that decomposition rates were largely independent of the diversity of detritivorous arthropods. Competition for nutrients in the litter layer is predictably high, due to the nutrient poor quality of southern Afrotemperate forests. This competition could attract certain decomposers to leaf-litter species of higher nutrient status, as shown for one leaf-litter species here. The 'enigma of soil diversity' might best be explained not through specialized interactions between detritivorous arthropods and leaf-litter species, but rather through other mechanisms, such as microbial and fungal activity and their interactions with arthropods.

AB  - Southern Amazonia is currently experiencing extensive land use change from forests to agriculture caused by increased local and global demand for agricultural products. However, little is known about the impacts of deforestation and land use change on soil biota. We investigated two regions in southern Amazonia (rainforest and Savannah/Cerrado biomes), analysing soil biota community turnover based on 16S (Archaea and Bacteria) and 18S rRNA genes (Eukaryotes, including Fungi, Protists and Animalia) and correlating them with soil chemistry and land use intensity. We found that soil biota community structure is driven by land use change in both Cerrado and rainforest. Crop fields approximatively doubled the richness of soil Archaea, Bacteria and Protists. We propose that crop systems not only increase soil pH and fertility, but also create continued disturbance (crop seasons) that stimulates soil diversity, as predicted by the dynamic equilibrium model (DEM) and the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). Even though agricultural fields had higher soil biota richness, some taxa were suppressed by agriculture (6/31 operational taxonomic units of Archaea, 245/1790 of Bacteria, 12/74 of Animalia, 20/144 of Fungi and 25/310 of Protists). Consequently, land use change in this region should proceed with caution. In the southern Amazonia region of Brazil, current laws require farmers to keep 20%-80% pristine vegetation areas on their property. Our data support the relevance of this law: since there are unique soil taxa under native vegetation, keeping these pristine areas adjacent to the agricultural fields should maximize soil biodiversity protection in these regions.

AB  - Livestock production extension in Amazon has caused deforestation and soil degradation, with negative consequences on diversity and environmental services. Recently, rubber crops have been established in deteriorated soils of the Colombian Amazon as an option to restore hectares of unproductive degraded pastures. Bioindicator insects, such as termites, have been used to assess soil quality and fertility restoration. This study evaluated differences in termite abundance, species richness, and community composition in three different rubber crop systems as an indirect way of evaluating soil diversity restoring. Three rubber crop systems were sampled: clonal fields (rubber monocultures with different rubber clones), traditional commercial rubber plantations (rubber monocultures with just one rubber clone), and mixed plantations (rubber fields intercropped with copoazu fruit trees). Additionally, pastures in use for livestock production and natural forest relicts were compared to rubber crop systems, to serve as reference habitats. Termites were sampled using a 105-m transect method. Alpha diversity and beta diversity were estimated and compared between rubber crops and reference habitats. A total of 80 termite species belonging to two families were collected. Mixed plantations and pastures presented the lowest diversity rates. Species richness in rubber crop systems was 39% higher than that in pastures and included 72% of the termite species found in natural forests. Indicator species analysis associated soil-feeding termites with less diverse habitats and wood-feeding termites with high diverse habitats. Our results demonstrate that termite recovery will depend on the farming system selected and the agricultural practices implemented in the field, with some rubber crop systems, like commercial rubber plantations and clonal fields, recovering termite diversity better than others, such as mixed plantations.

AB  - Projected changes in precipitation regimes can greatly impact soil biota, which in turn alters key ecosystem functions. In moss-dominated ecosystems, the bryosphere (i.e., the ground moss layer including live and senesced moss) plays a key role in carbon and nutrient cycling, and it hosts high abundances of microfauna (i.e., nematodes and tardigrades) and mesofauna (i.e., mites and springtails). However, we know very little about how bryosphere fauna responds to precipitation, and whether this response changes across environmental gradients. Here, we used a mesocosm experiment to study the effect of volume and frequency of precipitation on the abundance and community composition of functional groups of bryosphere fauna. Hylocomium splendens bryospheres were sampled from a long-term post-fire boreal forest chronosequence in northern Sweden which varies greatly in environmental conditions. We found that reduced precipitation promoted the abundance of total microfauna and of total mesofauna, but impaired predaceous/omnivorous nematodes, and springtails. Generally, bryosphere fauna responded more strongly to precipitation volume than to precipitation frequency. For some faunal functional groups, the effects of precipitation frequency were stronger at reduced precipitation volumes. Context-dependency effects were found for microfauna only: microfauna was more sensitive to precipitation in late-successional forests (i.e., those with lower productivity and soil nutrient availability) than in earlier-successional forests. Our results also suggest that drought-induced changes in trophic interactions and food resources in the bryosphere may increase faunal abundance. Consequently, drier bryospheres that may result from climate change could promote carbon and nutrient turnover from fauna activity, especially in older, less productive forests.

AB  - Soil mesofauna plays an important role in decomposing organic matter, recycling nutrients, and increasing nutrient availability. The effects of nitrogen (N) deposition and reduced precipitation on the litter-dwelling mesofaunal community and how this process affects litter decomposition remain poorly understood. Herein, a two-year simulated N deposition and throughfall reduction experiment was carried out in a natural evergreen broad-leaved subtropical forest to examine the effects of N deposition and reduced precipitation on soil mesofauna during litter decomposition. Four treatments were established: control (CK), N deposition (N), reduced precipitation (RP), and combined N deposition and reduced precipitation (N + RP). We collected and identified 19,782 individuals of mesofauna in litterbags during the whole experiment. Mites (Prostigmata, Mesostigmata, and Oribatida) and Collembola comprised almost 90% of the total number of individuals collected and dominated the soil mesofauna in our study. Our results revealed the negative effects of N deposition on the density of Oribatida mites and Collembola and the total density of soil mesofauna. Reduced precipitation significantly increased the density of Collembola and Oribatida mites and the total density of mesofauna and marginally significantly increased the density of Mesostigmata mites but decreased the diversity of mesofauna. The interaction effects of N deposition and reduced precipitation significantly affected the density of Prostigmata mites, Oribatida mites, Collembola, and the diversity of mesofauna. N deposition combined with reduced precipitation significantly inhibited litter decomposition, whereas no significant interaction effects were observed. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that litter mass loss was significantly positively correlated with the density of Prostigmata, Mesostigmata, and Oribatida, as well as the diversity of mesofauna. Overall, during the two-year decomposition process, our results suggest that N deposition and reduced precipitation interactively affected mesofaunal diversity and that N deposition adversely affected the mesofaunal community, while reduced precipitation increased the density of some groups but decreased mesofaunal diversity, consequently cascading on the decomposition of leaf litter.

AB  - Conserving the remaining savanna ecosystems in the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) - a global biodiversity hotspot that stores carbon and provides water to a large portion of South America - requires understanding the ecological processes maintaining their function. Nutrient cycling supports savanna function via plant litter production and decomposition by soil fauna, releasing nutrients for plant and soil organism uptake. Soil biodiversity and biogeochemistry linkages with litter dynamics in Neotropical savannas under a changing climate are poorly understood. Here, we combined two years of rainfall seasonality, leaf and wood litter production and decomposition with soil epigeic fauna abundance - the number of ground-surface dwelling invertebrates collected through pitfall traps - taxa richness, Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness, and 16 soil biogeochemical variables measured in 12 plots of preserved savanna. Rainfall seasonality modulated the mean soil epigeic fauna diversity and evenness across all plots, which were highest in the rainy season, in contrast to litterfall rates, which peaked in the dry season. In the dry season (April to September), the Formicidae family was the most abundant with 50% of all individuals, while in the rainy season (October to March), the Isoptera order was the most abundant with approximately 39% of individuals. Wood litter decomposition grouped with annual Hemiptera abundance, co-varying with soil epigeic fauna diversity and evenness per plot and against soil fertility variables. Leaf litter decomposition co-varied with the total epigeic fauna abundance and soil pH. We speculate that the specific need to decompose wood litter may be associated with a greater need for diversity than an abundance of soil epigeic fauna. Our work highlights the role of rainfall seasonality on soil biodiversity and physicochemistry, which is also tightly linked with litter production and decomposition. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms governing nutrient cycling in savanna ecosystems on nutrient-impoverished soils, with implications for achieving sustainable conservation and restoration goals.

AB  - Drivers of global change such as warming and increased nitrogen (N) availability are altering soil communities worldwide, with unknown consequences for the functioning of the terrestrial ecosystems. Higher N availability may stimulate soil communities and boost nutrient cycling, but the expected increase in aridity may nullify this effect. Additionally, shifts in microbial communities may lead to trophic cascades throughout soil food webs, affecting key ecosystem properties associated with the turnover of carbon and nutrients. Whether the responses to these different drivers of global change are similar between the main guilds of soil organisms, however, is unclear. We analyzed soil phospholipid fatty acids and extracted soil fauna to determine the simultaneous responses of microbial and arthropod soil communities to experimental drought and increased N availability in a Mediterranean forest. The experimental drought decreased community sizes across the entire soil food web, and N addition increased the biomass of all microbial groups except fungi, thereby increasing the relative dominance of bacteria. Likewise, the abundance of oribatid mites strongly increased after the addition of N, whereas the population of springtails quickly decreased, leading to a shift in the structure of the arthropod community. An increase in soil N availability promoted the energy channel dominated by bacteria, triggering a bottom-up trophic cascade affecting the arthropod mesofauna, thus propagating the effects of N inputs throughout the soil food web. The strong constraint of drought on soil microbes, however, may neutralize the effect of an increase in N availability. Complex interactions among factors of global change may therefore hinder our ability to predict their effects on soil biodiversity and associated consequences for ecosystem functioning. Forecasts of responses of soil biodiversity to global change should not only consider different drivers and their potential interactions, but also the likely contrasting effects among different groups of soil organisms.

AB  - Summer droughts strongly affect soil organic carbon (SOC) cycling, but net effects on SOC storage are unclear as drought affects both C inputs and outputs from soils. Here, we explored the overlooked role of soil fauna on SOC storage in forests, hypothesizing that soil faunal activity is particularly drought-sensitive, thereby reducing litter incorporation into the mineral soil and, eventually, long-term SOC storage. In a drought-prone pine forest (Switzerland), we performed a large-scale irrigation experiment for 17 years and assessed its impact on vertical SOC distribution and composition. We also examined litter mass loss of dominant tree species using different mesh-size litterbags and determined soil fauna abundance and community composition. The 17-year-long irrigation resulted in a C loss in the organic layers (-1.0 kg C m(-2)) and a comparable C gain in the mineral soil (+0.8 kg C m(-2)) and thus did not affect total SOC stocks. Irrigation increased the mass loss of Quercus pubescens and Viburnum lantana leaf litter, with greater effect sizes when meso- and macrofauna were included (+215%) than when excluded (+44%). The enhanced faunal-mediated litter mass loss was paralleled by a many-fold increase in the abundance of meso- and macrofauna during irrigation. Moreover, Acari and Collembola community composition shifted, with a higher presence of drought-sensitive species in irrigated soils. In comparison, microbial SOC mineralization was less sensitive to soil moisture. Our results suggest that the vertical redistribution of SOC with irrigation was mainly driven by faunal-mediated litter incorporation, together with increased root C inputs. Our study shows that soil fauna is highly sensitive to natural drought, which leads to a reduced C transfer from organic layers to the mineral soil. In the longer term, this potentially affects SOC storage and, therefore, soil fauna plays a key but so far largely overlooked role in shaping SOC responses to drought.

AB  - Nitrogen deposition can promote belowground soil carbon pools, and precipitation reduction can eliminate this positive effect. Soil fauna play crucial roles in regulating the dynamics of organic matter and maintaining biodiversity in ecosystems. However, it is not clear whether belowground soil fauna have similar responses to changes after long-term nitrogen deposition and drought. We simulated nitrogen deposition by applying fertilizer, and simulated drought by excluding 30% of the ambient precipitation in a temperate forest from 2009. Our results showed that experimental precipitation reduction alone significantly changed the composition and decreased the abundance of the soil faunal community. Precipitation reduction could also promote the soil food web in a fungal-dominated pathway by decreasing trophic groups of Isotomidae abundance. In contrast, although nitrogen addition treatment increased soil available nitrogen content, it had a neutral effect on the soil faunal community. Soil faunal community showed strong temporal variations in response to both nitrogen deposition and precipitation reduction treatments. Notably, interactions between precipitation reduction, nitrogen addition, and sampling time were significant for specific trophic groups, including saprozoites and omnivores. Shannon-Weiner diversity was not sensitive to these global change factors. Our results suggest that soil water content and plant richness may, directly and indirectly, regulate the soil faunal community.

AB  - Litter production and its decomposition play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycle and soil quality, being a crucial process involved in ecosystem productivity and functioning. Understanding this process under pine commercial stands or pine invasions is crucial to design forest management or ecosystems restoration. We conducted a study in a commercial pine plantation (Pinus taeda L.) under Atlantic Forest biome to investigate (1) the contribution of soil fauna to pine litter mass loss; (2) the litter fauna feeding activity within seasons. Litter bags with pine needles (5 g dry weight) were prepared as exclusion treatments for different sized soil fauna by varying mesh size (2 mm and 0.06 mm). Litter bags were removed after 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 365 days to estimate the decomposition rates. Bait lamina sticks were exposed seasonally and horizontally in soil surface to determine the fauna feeding activity on litter. We found: (1) no differences in litter mass loss and decomposition rate when soil macrofauna and most of the mesofauna were excluded; (2) feeding activity of litter organisms was higher in the summer, probably stimulated by a combination of high temperature and rainfall. In commercial pine stands, we can conclude that the nutrient cycling is slower than in natural areas, related to litter traits, as described in the scientific literature. Our results indicated that soil macro and mesofauna play a low role in the pine litter decomposition, where the organic material decomposition is more related to microorganism's activity.

AB  - Soil nematodes are important contributors to soil biodiversity. Nonetheless, the distribution patterns and environmental drivers of soil nematode communities are poorly understood, especially at the large scale, where multiple environmental variables covary. We collected 520 soil samples from 104 sites representing alpine meadow and steppe ecosystems. First, we explored the soil nematode community characteristics and compared community patterns between the ecosystems. Then, we examined the contributions of aboveground and belowground factors on these patterns. The genus richness and abundance of nematodes on the Tibetan Plateau are lower than other alpine ecosystems, but are comparable to desert or polar ecosystems. Alpine meadows supported a higher nematode abundance and genus richness than alpine steppes; bacterial-based energy channels were pre-dominant in both the ecosystems. Soil factors explained the most variation in the soil nematode community composition in the alpine meadows, while plant factors were as essential as soil factors in the alpine steppes. Unexpectedly, the climate variables barely impacted the nematode communities. This is the first study to explore the spatial patterns of soil nematode compositions on the Tibetan Plateau, and we found that the contributions of climate, plants, and soil properties on soil nematodes community were essentially different from the previous knowledge for well-studied plant and animal communities.

AB  - Soil organisms play a major role on litter decomposition process and nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. These organisms are extremely sensitive to environmental conditions such as soil temperature and moisture conditions which control their demographic parameters and activity. The ongoing climate change can therefore directly affect soil biota communities and the processes they drive. Besides, climate change can also indirectly affect soil biota by altering tree functional traits (e.g., N, Ca, Mg, water holding capacity) with cascading effects on the litter quality. The aim of this study was to determine the relative effects of increased drought and litter type on microbial biomass (bacteria and fungi) and mesofauna abundance (Collembola and Acari) in three experimental sites representative of the three main forests encountered in the northern part of the Mediterranean Basin (dominated by either Quercus pubescens, Quercus ilex or Pinus halepensis) where rainfall exclusion experiments were taking place. At each site, and in each precipitation treatment (natural and amplified drought plots), we collected and transplanted foliage litters (i.e., species x drought level). After two years, we reported a litter species effect: Q. pubescens litter presented consistently the higher abundance of all soil biota groups compared to Q. ilex and P. halepensis litters in each forest. Surprisingly, despite that the amplified drought treatment induced a modification of the litter quality, we did not reported an indirect reduced precipitation effect on soil biota parameters. While Oribatid Acari abundance decreased with amplified drought in all three forest types, the direct effects on the other soil biota groups were forest-dependent. In P. halepensis forest, amplified drought resulted in higher bacterial and fungal biomasses but lower Collembola abundance. In Q. ilex forest both Collembola and predatory Acari abundances decreased with amplified drought. In addition, the positive relationships between Collembola and Oribatida abundances and litter mass loss disappeared under amplified drought conditions in both Q. ilex and P. halepensis forests. These results suggest a key role played by Ca, Mg, specific leaf area (SLA) and water holding capacity (WHC) as drivers of soil biota parameters. Finally, the study highlights that within the same Mediterranean region, climate change could differently alter the soil organisms inhabiting the litter layer and their contributions to the decomposition process depending on the tree species and soil biota group considered.

AB  - Soil invertebrates are key to decomposition, a central ecosystem process related to soil health. In many temperate areas cli-mate change will decrease soil water content, which strongly modulates biological activity. However, data are lacking on how shifts in rainfall patterns affect soil biota and the ecosystem processes they provide. Here, we used the bait-lamina test to exper-imentally assess how a severe drought event influenced detritivore feeding activity, during a wheat growing season, in soils under long-term organic or conventional farming. Additionally, biotic and abiotic soil parameters were measured. Feeding activity was reduced under extreme drought and conventional management, although no climate-management synergies were found. Vertical migrations of Collembola and Oribatida partially explained the unexpectedly higher bait consumption at shal-lower depths in response to drought. Exploratory mixed-effects longitudinal random forests (a novel machine learning tech-nique) were used to explore whether the relative abundances of meso-, microfauna and microbes of the decomposer food web, or abiotic soil parameters, affected the feeding activity of detritivores. The model including meso- and microfauna selected four Nematoda taxa and explained higher variance than the model with only microbiota, indicating that detritivore feeding is closely associated with nematodes but not with microbes. Additionally, the model combining fauna and microbiota explained less variance than the faunal model, suggesting that microbe-fauna synergies barely affected detritivore feeding. Moreover, soil water and mineral nitrogen contents were found to strongly determine detritivore feeding, in a positive and negative way, respectively. Hence, our results suggest that severe drought and conventional farming impair the feeding activity of soil detriti-vores and thus, probably, decomposition and nutrient mineralization in soils. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms arise as a powerful technique to explore the identity of potential key drivers relating biodiversity to ecosystem functioning. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The loss of plant productivity with declining diversity is well established, exceeding other global change drivers including drought. These patterns are most clearly established for aboveground productivity, it remains poorly understood whether productivity increases associated with diversity are replicated belowground. To address this gap, we established a plant diversity-manipulation experiment in 2018. It is a full factorial manipulation of plant species richness and community composition, and precipitation. Three and five years post-establishment, two bulk soil cores (20cm depth) were collected and composited from each plot and were processed for roots to determine belowground biomass as root standing crop. We observed a strong positive relationship between richness and aboveground production and belowground biomass, generating positive combined above and belowground with diversity. Root standing crop increased 1.4-fold from years three to five. Grass communities produced more root biomass (monoculture mean 463.9 +/- 410.3g m-2), and the magnitude of the relationship between richness and root standing crop was greatest within those communities. Legume communities produced the fewest roots (monoculture mean 212.2 +/- 155.1g m-2), and belowground standing crop was not affected by diversity. Root standing crops in year three were 1.8 times higher under low precipitation conditions, while in year five we observed comparable root standing crops between precipitation treatments. Plant family was a strong mediator of increased belowground biomass observed with diversity, with single family grass and aster families generating 1.7 times greater root standing crops in six compared to single species communities, relationships between diversity and aboveground production were consistently observed in both single-family and multiple family communities. Diverse communities with species from multiple families generated only 1.3 times the root standing crop compared to monoculture average root biomass. We surprisingly observe diverse single family communities can generate increases in root standing crops that exceed those generated by diverse multiple family communities, highlighting the importance of plant richness within plant family for a given community. These patterns have potential implications for understanding the interactions of multiple global change drivers as changes in both precipitation and plant community composition do alter whether plant production aboveground is translated belowground biomass.

AB  - Urbanization is accelerating worldwide, resulting in drastic alterations of natural riverbanks, which seriously affects the ecological functions and services of riparian landscapes. Our understanding of how anthropogenic activities influence soil animal communities within riparian zones is scarce. The soil fauna represents an important biotic component of the soil ecosystem and greatly contributes to soil structure and fertility formation. We investigated the richness, abundance, diversity, and distribution of soil animal groups, including macro- and mesofauna, in different riparian landscapes along an urban-rural habitat gradient. In natural riparian zones with permeable revetments, the soil fauna was richest and most abundant, mainly because of the low levels of human disturbance and the more suitable habitat conditions. Different soil animal groups responded differently to revetment type and distance from the water flow. The hygrophilous soil mesofauna, requiring a more humid environment, was more sensitive to shifts in revetment types, the location on the riverbank, and the seasons. In summer, when precipitation in the study area was highest, the abundance of the hygrophilous soil mesofauna was significantly higher than in autumn. Distance from the water flow significantly affected the abundance of the hygrophilous soil mesofauna. Our results demonstrated that hygrophilous soil mesofauna can serve as a good indicator in riparian zones, reflecting the hydrological conditions. We also observed interactions between revetment type and distance from the water flow; the distance effect was stronger in the natural riparian zone with a permeable revetment type. Our results highlight the importance of anthropogenic effects on soil ecosystem processes and functions in riparian landscapes, and the necessity of protecting and retaining the natural riverbank and native vegetation patches in riparian landscape planning and construction.

AB  - The role of tree canopies in protecting soil functional diversity is essential for ecosystems threatened by the longer lasting periods of drought, which are predicted to increase in the southern afro-tropical region. Nonetheless, biodiversity inventories of soil mesofauna are scarce in afro-tropical ecosystems, even in emblematic and well-studied protected areas, such as the Gorongosa National Park (GNP). Understanding the interrelationships between tree canopies and soil fauna functional diversity can provide insightful information for future adaptive management to protect wildlife and ecosystem services in the GNP, in the context of climate change. Here we assessed collembolan functional type richness and functional diversity in the dry period and during the rainfall across major GNP habitat types: miombo forests, mixed forests, and open savanna/floodplains. Besides the significant positive influence of rainfall, habitat types also influenced functional type' richness and diversity of collembolan life-forms. Environmental gradients across habitat types, namely the area of tree canopy cover and its indirect effect on soil local conditions (pH and nutrient availability), explained collembolan functional parameters. Calcium concentrations and soil alkalinity significantly enhanced collembolan functional type richness and functional diversity, respectively. Collembola survival across GNP habitats depended on the canopy buffering in the dry sampling period. These results highlight the key role of tree canopies in creating suitable microhabitat conditions supporting soil functional diversity and the sustainability of soil processes and ecosystem services in GNP.

AB  - Deforestation in the Amazonian rainforest is the main cause of biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and climate change. Land covers influence the soil properties, soil biota community composition, and litter properties by providing habitat and nutrients. Our aim here was to present a quantitative analysis of the soil biochemical properties, soil biota assemblage, and litter properties associated with four land covers (primary Amazon rainforest, pasture, Hevea brasiliensis, and deforested sites) from the Brazil's Legal Amazon, Rio Branco, Acre. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) grouped the land covers in four groups considering the dissimilarities on soil biota abundance between each other. The SEM models showed that deforestation increased the soil pH, and decreased SOC, TN, P, microbial N biomass, microbial C biomass, litter lignin content, litter N, C and P contents, and biodiversity indices (Margalef index, and alpha diversity). The results of our study highlighted the importance of considering land covers in Brazil's Legal Amazon, based on a sustainable way to improve soil quality and soil biodiversity, since even the studied monocropping system (pasture) showed decreases in habitat provision (litter deposition) and nutrient availability. Thus, the use of forest systems (H. brasiliensis) or the preservation of pri-mary Amazon rainforest may positively influence the soil chemical properties, soil biota, and litter properties.

AB  - Sustained nitrogen (N) deposition has a wide-ranging impact on terrestrial ecosystems. However, still little attention has been paid to responses of urban soil fauna to the increasing N deposition. To clarify such effects on the soil properties and soil fauna in typical urban lawns (featuring Cynodon dactylon vegetation), a control experiment was conducted for 1 year, in which NH4NO3 was added as the external N source with four treatments of N addition: N0 (i.e., only water), N1 (50 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), N2 (100 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), N3 (150 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Results showed that N additions influence soil faunal communities in the urban lawns soil. The relative abundance of Oribatida increased with the N treatment level, partially replacing the more sensitive Collembola. Significant differences in the Shannon-Wiener and Margalef indices (p < 0.01) supported this statement. Although higher doses of N addition showed adverse effects on soil fauna communities, low N inputs increased the soil fauna diversity and richness, especially at 5-10 cm depth. A threshold effect appears to exist: low N addition (<25 kg N ha(-1)) did not negatively affect pedofauna structure and composition, while in the range from these values up to 50 kg N ha(-1), the composition of the soil fauna underwent major changes which were confirmed by the decline of biodiversity indices. These changes are accompanied by the decreased pH values with increasing N inputs.

Multiple factors such as environmental conditions, litter quality and decomposer organisms are known to influence this ecological process in direct and indirect ways. However, it remains poorly understood to what extent this entangled bank of complex interactions can be disrupted by several global change drivers such as climate change and invasive species. Here we reported main findings from a litter decomposition experiment conducted in a natural mixed forest invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi, an exotic oomycete well known for causing tree disease and forest decline. In two Mediterranean forest types (namely woodland and closed forest), we first built a rainfall exclusion infrastructure to reduce natural precipitation by 30%. Then, we followed the spatial variation in C and N leaf litter dynamics as well as the abundance of the exotic oomycete P. cinnamomi for 18 months under both control and rainfall exclusion conditions using a litter bag methodology with different mesh sizes to further evaluate the indirect role of mesofauna abundance and diversity in litter C and N temporal dynamics. Significant reductions in soil moisture produced by the experimental rainfall exclusion increased C litter loss with time directly, and indirectly via increases in overall mesofauna abundance and changes in the ratio between predators and decomposers. N litter dynamics were in contrast modulated mainly by initial litter quality. Surprisingly, P. cinnamomi abundance did not correlate with variation in initial litter quality as previously suggested, but we found that the exotic oomycete was negatively correlated with both decomposer and predator abundances. These results suggest it might participate indirectly in litter decomposition dynamics through the biotic soil component. Synthesis. Contrary to expected, our results show that a moderate but realistic rainfall reduction can accelerate the litter decomposition process. It also points out to litter fauna as a key component modulating the indirect impacts of global change drivers on litter decomposition.

AB  - Annually, millions of hectares of land are affected by wildfires worldwide, disrupting ecosystems functioning by affecting on-site vegetation, soil, and above-and belowground biodiversity, but also triggering erosive off-site impacts such as water-bodies contamination or mudflows. Here, we present a soil erosion assessment following the 2017's wildfires at the European scale, including an analysis of vegetation recovery and soil erosion mitigation potential. Results indicate a sharp increase in soil losses with 19.4 million Mg additional erosion in the first post-fire year when compared to unburned conditions. Over five years, 44 million Mg additional soil losses were estimated, and 46% of the burned area presented no signs of full recovery. Post-fire mitigation could attenuate these impacts by 63-77%, reducing soil erosion to background levels by the 4th post-fire year. Our insights may help identifying target policies to reduce land degradation, as identified in the European Union Soil, Forest, and Biodiversity strategies.

AB  - Deforestation, plantation expansion and other human activities in tropical ecosystems are often associated with biological invasions. These processes have been studied for above-ground organisms, but associated changes below the ground have received little attention. We surveyed rainforest and plantation systems in Jambi province, Sumatra, Indonesia, to investigate effects of land-use change on the diversity and abundance of earthworms-a major group of soil-ecosystem engineers that often is associated with human activities. Density and biomass of earthworms increased 4-30-fold in oil palm and rubber monoculture plantations compared to rainforest. Despite much higher abundance, earthworm communities in plantations were less diverse and dominated by the peregrine morphospecies Pontoscolex corethrurus, often recorded as invasive. Considering the high deforestation rate in Indonesia, invasive earthworms are expected to dominate soil communities across the region in the near future, in lieu of native soil biodiversity. Ecologically-friendly management approaches, increasing structural habitat complexity and plant diversity, may foster beneficial effects of invasive earthworms on plant growth while mitigating negative effects on below-ground biodiversity and the functioning of the native soil animal community.

AB  - Soil fauna plays a crucial role in plant litter decomposition. However, if and how increasing nitrogen (N) deposition and plant functional type jointly affect the contribution of soil mesofauna to litter decomposition remains poorly understood. A litterbag experiment with two meshed sizes (0.1 and 2 mm) was conducted to examine the effects of soil mesofauna on litter decomposition of three coexisting functional types of trees (evergreen broadleaf, deciduous broadleaf and coniferous) differing in litter identity (6 tree litter species for each plant functional type). Litterbags were exposed to three N addition levels (0, 20 and 40 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) in a subtropical forest of southwest China. Overall, soil mesofauna significantly increased litter mass loss with the most profound effect in evergreen broadleaf litter. Further, the high N addition treatment stimulated the effects of soil mesofauna on litter decomposition, particularly in deciduous broadleaf litter. Soil mesofauna effects were positively correlated with initial leaf litter chemical characteristics, such as carbon and cellulose concentration and C/P ratio. The N effect was greater in low N than high N treatments in the 0.1 mm litterbags, but was similar in the two N addition levels in the 2 mm litterbags. Our results indicate that soil mesofauna effects on litter decomposition at low N addition are higher in evergreen broadleaf than in deciduous broadleaf and coniferous litter, and generally increase with N addition levels, particularly in deciduous litter species. The findings underscore the importance of soil mesofauna and plant functional types for litter decomposition in subtropical forests where N deposition is substantially increasing.

AB  - Soil fauna performs several functions in native and anthropized ecosystems, being affected by spatiotemporal variation and by environmental resource availability. However, there is still a gap in knowledge of how land use change, climatic seasonality, and soil and climate variables impact trophic groups of soil fauna in semiarid environments. We investigated the abundance of detritivores, herbivores, microbivores and predators in three land uses (native forest, pasture and irrigated agriculture), during the dry and wet season, using two collection methods (manually separated soil monoliths and pitfalls) and the effects of soil and climate variables on soil fauna. Detritivore and predator activity was predominant in the 0-20 cm layer (monoliths), while herbivores and microbivores abundance were greater on the soil surface (pitfalls). Irrigated agricultural areas had higher abundance of soil fauna and a different community structure from native forest and pasture, due to continuous water availability. Climatic seasonal variables (temperature, air humidity, solar radiation and wind speed), soil characteristics (Macronutrients, C, C:N ratio, pH and CEC) and land use change impacted all trophic groups. Irrigated agriculture in semiarid regions can serve as a refuge for soil fauna, bringing light to a new community structure that can be shaped to shelter the highest possible biodiversity.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) deposition is a worldwide environmental problem. Although the effects of N deposition on ecosystems have been widely studied, most of these studies failed to consider how the effects of N deposition were altered by plant canopy interception. Here, we compared the effects of canopy addition of N (CAN) vs. understory addition of N (UAN) on soil mesofauna in a monsoon evergreen broadleaf forest in Guangdong Province, South China; the CAN and UAN treatments (plus a control without N addition) were applied monthly (April to October) at two rates (25 and 50 kg N ha(-1)yr(-1)) started in April 2013. Soil mesofauna were extracted from the soil and quantified at 19th month (November 2014) and 31st month (November 2015) after the experiment began. We found significant effects of the addition approaches (CAN vs. UAN) on soil mesofauna. However, contrary to our expectations, the results showed a negative reaction of soil mesofauna to CAN approach compared with UAN approach. In 2015, the individuals, group richness and diversity of the mesofauna community, and the individuals of Oribatida and Collembola in CAN plots were significantly less than in UAN plots. This study discovered the different effects of CAN vs. UAN approaches on soil mesofauna. The negative effects of CAN on soil mesofauna would not be explained by the variation of reactive nitrogen but by some other non-N washed ions from the canopy into the soil. More attentions should be paid to the study on canopy process of N deposition in the future.

AB  - Fires lead to dramatic shifts in ecosystems and have a large impact on the biota. Soil organisms, especially soil fauna, are often used as indicators of environmental change. At present, minimal attention has been paid to using soil fauna as an indicator of environmental change after a fire. Here, a field survey of burnt herbaceous vegetation in semi-arid areas was conducted to determine the response of soil arthropods to fire and their short-term recovery after fire. Overall, the abundance and biomass of soil arthropods was more sensitive to fire than the number of groups. The number of soil arthropod groups, especially the dominant groups (mites and springtails), was not significantly affected by wildfires. At the unburned site, soil arthropod abundance showed significant seasonal shifts that may be related to the vegetation properties, temperature, and precipitation caused by seasonal changes. In contrast, soil arthropods at the burnt sites showed a delayed recovery and had only reached 56%-82%, 17%-54%, and 91%-190% of the biomass in the unburnt forest at the 3, 6, and 9 months after the burning event. Our findings of soil arthropod abundance changes in the present study suggest that fire-induced changes in soil and vegetation properties (e.g., AN, LT, and VC) were crucial factors for the changes in soil arthropod abundance in this semi-arid grassland. We conclude that fire disturbance reduces the seasonal sensitivity of soil arthropods by altering their habitat. This study furthers our understanding of wildfire impact recovery by documenting the short-term temporal dynamics of soil arthropods.

AB  - Land-use change is threatening biodiversity worldwide and is predicted to increase in the next decades, especially in tropical regions. Most studies focused on the response of single or few species to land-use change, only few investigated the response of entire communities. In particular the response of belowground communities to changes in land use received little attention. Oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari) are among the most abundant soil animals, involved in decomposition processes and nutrient cycling. Oribatid mite species span a wide range of trophic niches and are known to sensitively respond to changes in land use. Here, we investigated shifts in the community-level trophic niche of oribatid mites with the conversion of rainforest into rubber and oil palm plantations. Due to a wider range of resources in more natural ecosystems, we expected the community-level trophic niche to shrink with conversion of rainforest into plantations. As the conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with reduced availability of litter resources, we expected the average trophic level (indicated by the N-15/N-14 ratio) to be higher and basal resources (indicated by the C-13/C-12 ratio) to shift toward living plant material in rubber and oil palm plantations. Our analysis showed that community-level trophic niches in rainforest and rubber agroforest ("jungle rubber") were separated from those in monoculture plantation systems, indicating a trophic niche shift with land-use intensification. As hypothesized, oribatid mites shifted their diet toward predation and/or scavenging and toward the plant-based energy channel with transformation of rainforest into plantations. Exceptionally low minimum C-13/C-12 ratios in rubber plantations suggest that certain oribatid mite species in this land-use system use resources not available in the other studied ecosystems. We detected high isotopic uniqueness in oil palm plantations suggesting a low trophic redundancy and thus high vulnerability of trophic functioning in this system in comparison to rainforest. Overall, the results suggest that the conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with pronounced shifts in community-level trophic niches of mesofauna detritivores with potential major consequences for the functioning of the decomposer system.

AB  - Despite their distinctive role in regulating agroecosystems, soil fauna is largely excluded from conservation action. With increasing evidence supporting matrix functionality as critical for multiple species in agroecosystems, it is important that efforts meant to enhance biodiversity in managed systems be inclusive and effective for all species and not just charismatic fauna. Third party certifications are a popular mechanism for claiming pro-conservation practises in tropical agricultural lands. Therefore, we asked whether voluntary practises codified by third party certifications of tropical tea plantations support soil biodiversity, and what factors explain soil arthropod abundance and richness in such certified and uncertified landscapes. We used pitfall trap data and soil samples across two seasons in large tea plantations, and small tea-growing agroforestry farms in the Darjeeling Himalayas in India. Plantations certified and those not certified were selected for the study. Soil arthropod morphospecies abundance, richness and diversity were significantly higher in summer as opposed to winter. Contrary to our expectations, there was no significant difference in soil arthropod abundance, richness and diversity between uncertified small agroforestry farms and certified large monoculture plantations. Our analysis establishes tree species richness and season as the most important predictors of soil arthropod abundance, richness and effective number of species. We recommend that increased abundance and diversity of native trees in the tea matrix should be a crucial criterion for agroecosystem management. This would improve matrix functionality for species that are sensitive to management and reflect practises that enhance biodiversity.

AB  - Tropical forests are critical for ecosystem functioning and are the major provider of global ecosystem services. The combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic disturbances in the tropics, however, have caused a mass decline in major ecosystem services in recent decades. Nevertheless, most previous studies focused entirely on these disturbances' effects on forest ecosystem services without taking into consideration the combined effects of climate change and disturbances on key ecosystem services' indicators. This is more pronounced in Bangladesh, which is one of the countries most adversely affected by global climate change. We investigated anthropogenic disturbances' effects on regulating ecosystem services under different rainfall regimes in Khadimnagar National Park (KNP) and Satchari National Park (SNP), two major forested, protected areas in Northeast Bangladesh. We considered twelve indicators for five aboveground ecosystem services (i.e., primary production, carbon storage, biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and timber production) and four indicators for four belowground ecosystem services (i.e., organic carbon storage, soil aggregate stability, soil physical support, and soil water regulation) in our study. The effects of disturbances on the indicators of four aboveground ecosystem services (i.e., primary production, tree carbon storage, biodiversity conservation, and timber production) and one belowground ecosystem service (soil physical support) differed in terms of rainfall regimes. Disturbances negatively influenced indicators of primary production (p = 0.03, r = -0.28), tree carbon storage (p = 0.02, r = -0.29), and timber production (p = 0.002, r = -0.39), and positively impacted soil organic carbon storage (p = 0.04, r = 0.27) only under a medium-rainfall regime. Interestingly, a significant positive impact of disturbances on soil physical support (p = 0.001, r = 0.39) was observed under heavy rainfall in our study. In addition, disturbances were significantly associated with biodiversity conservation (p < 0.05) and wildlife habitat quality (p < 0.05) under both rainfall classes. Our findings provide critical insights into the synergistic role of anthropogenic perturbations in regulating ecosystem services with rainfall pattern as a key climatic parameter, which can be useful in restoring large tracts of degraded tropical forests in the United Nations (UN) Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.

AB  - Soil fauna plays a key role in regulating biogeochemical cycles, but how multiple global change factors (GCFs) may affect faunal communities remains poorly studied. We conducted a meta-analysis using 1154 observations to evaluate the individual and combined effects of elevated CO2, nitrogen (N) addition, warming, increased rainfall and drought on soil fauna density and diversity. Here we show that, overall, individual and combined effects of GCFs had negligible effects on soil fauna density and diversity, except that density was negatively affected by drought (-27.4%) and positively affected by increased rainfall individually (+24.9%) and in combination with N addition (+67.3%) or warming (+70.4%). GCF effects varied among taxonomic groups both in magnitude and direction. Variables such as latitude, elevation and experimental setting significantly impacted both individual and combined effects. Our results suggest that soil fauna density is affected by changed rainfall regimes, while diversity is resistant against individual and combined effects of multiple GCFs.

AB  - Climate change-induced alterations in precipitation regimes can substantially impact litter decomposition and consequently affect carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the response patterns of litter decomposition to precipitation changes and their controlling factors remain ambiguous. We conducted a global meta-analysis to examine the responses of leaf litter decomposition and their sensitivities to increased precipitation (IP) and decreased precipitation (DP) based on 68 publications with 2940 paired observations in field litterbag experiments. We further explored how responses of litter decomposition varied with the intensity and timing of precipitation changes, ecosystem type, climatic conditions, litter traits, decomposition duration, and soil fauna. Litter decomposition showed double-asymmetric responses to precipitation changes. On a global scale, IP enhanced litter decomposition on average by 16%, whereas DP reduced litter decomposition by 21%. Litter decomposition was more sensitive to IP than DP at low precipitation changes but exhibited a greater response to DP than IP at extreme precipitation changes. In addition, litter decomposition in forests showed a stronger response to precipitation changes than that in other ecosystems, and litter decomposition was more sensitive to precipitation change under warm and wet conditions. Compared to precipitation changes in the growing season, litter decomposition showed a stronger response to IP but exhibited no response to DP in the non-growing season. The impacts of precipitation change gradually decreased with ongoing litter decomposition. Moreover, the initial lignin concentration in litter primarily determined the responses of litter decomposition to precipitation changes, with litter mixture and soil fauna partially mitigating the precipitation change effects. Our meta-analysis extends the double asymmetry model regarding the responses of litter decomposition to precipi-tation changes, which vary with ecosystem type, climatic conditions, litter chemical traits, decomposition duration, and soil fauna. These findings improve our ability to project the responses of terrestrial C and nutrient cycling to global precipitation changes.

AB  - The emergence of secondary forests in deforested tropical regions represents an opportunity to mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change, but there is still debate on how fast and to which level these forests can recover biodiversity. Recent studies have shown that the recovery of plant and vertebrate species richness is relatively fast, but the pace of recovery for other groups remains unclear. Soil macroinvertebrates play critical roles on litter decomposition and seed dispersal, therefore the pace of their recovery has consequences for the entire forest ecosystem.
   We investigated how fast broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna recover in the first 30 years of forest regeneration using forests older than 50 years as reference.
   We surveyed the number, diversity and abundance of 19 broad taxonomic groups of soil macrofauna in 85 sites located in Brazilian Amazon, covering forests of different ages and clearing frequencies. Forest age and clearing frequency were obtained accurately from Landsat images in forests up to 30 years old. We used regression analysis to determine (a) the effects forest age and clearing frequency on macrofauna groups in secondary forests up to 30 years old; and (b) the changes in macrofauna groups between young forests (up to 10 years old), median age forests (between 10 and 30 years old) and forests older than 50 years.
   We found that the number and diversity of macrofauna groups recover rapidly in the first 10 years of forest regrowth, but show slower change among older forests. This rapid recovery was also observed in the abundance of several taxonomic groups and for predators and detritivores as functional groups. Forest clearing frequency had no effect on the number or the diversity of macrofauna groups, but the abundance of ants increased as forest was cleared more often.
   Our results for soil macrofauna align with those in plant and vertebrate studies showing that secondary forests quickly recover a large part of their biodiversity and ecological functions. Therefore, global-scale conservation strategies are needed to ensure the opportunity for secondary forests to grow.

AB  - The conversion of natural vegetation to agricultural land uses in mountainous Andean landscapes threatens an array of key ecological processes and ecosystem services (ES). In protected areas and buffer regions that provide water to cities, it is critical to understand how interactions between plants and soil communities sustain a range of ecosystem functions associated with nutrient recycling, soil structure, and erosion control. We sought to examine how land use conversion within a mountainous tropical forest landscape influences the diversity of vegetation and soil macrofauna communities, soil physicochemical properties, and hydrological regulation services. Biodiversity and a suite of key soil-based ES were compared in five major land uses of the Cali River watershed: (1) annual cropping systems, (2) coffee plantations, (3) pastures, (4) abandoned shrubland, and (5) secondary forests. The diversity of woody and herbaceous vegetation, as well as soil macrofauna, was assessed in each land use. Soil chemical fertility and aggregate morphology were assessed via laboratory analyses and visual separation of soil aggregates based on their origin. Infiltration, runoff, and sediment production were measured using a portable rainfall simulator. We found a decrease in the diversity of woody vegetation across land uses to be associated with lower diversity of soil macrofauna. At the same time, agricultural management, annual crops in particular, supports the largest earthworm populations, likely due to increased organic inputs and low impact tillage, which appears not to diminish soil fertility and water infiltration. In contrast, the low soil fertility in pastures was associated with the lowest values of soil C, poor aggregation, and high bulk density and likely reflects overgrazing, with negative implications for water infiltration and erosion. Associations between the different sets of variables, evaluated with co-inertia analysis, highlight the hierarchical relevance of plant cover and woody diversity on ES. The biological complexity associated with intact forest cover appears to generate "bundles" of co-occurring ES, with this land use demonstrating the highest infiltration, and low runoff and sediment losses. Our findings demonstrate that forests and tree-based agricultural systems may better contribute to the provision of multiple ES, including biodiversity conservation and hydrologic regulation.

AB  - The observation and assessment of animal biodiversity using acoustic technology has developed considerably in recent years. Current eco-acoustic research focuses on automatic audio recorder arrays and acoustic indices, which may be used to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of local animal communities in high resolution. While such soundscapes have often been studied above ground, their applicability in soils has rarely been tested. For the first time, we applied acoustic and statistical methods to explore the spatial, diurnal, and seasonal dynamics of the soundscape in soils. We studied the dynamics of acoustic complexity in forest soils in the alpine Pfynwald forest in the Swiss canton of Valais and related them to meteorological and microclimatic data. To increase microclimatic variability, we used a long-term irrigation experiment. We also took soil samples close to the sensors on 6 days in different seasons. Daily and seasonal patterns of acoustic complexity were predicted to be associated with abiotic parameters-that is, meteorological and microclimatic conditions-and mediated by the dynamics of the diversity and activity of the soil fauna. Seasonal patterns in acoustic complexity showed the highest acoustic complexity values in spring and summer, decreasing in fall and winter. Diurnal acoustic complexity values were highest in the afternoon and lowest during the night. The measurement of acoustic diversity at the sampling site was significantly associated with soil communities, with relationships between taxa richness or community composition and acoustic complexity being strongest shortly before taking the soil samples. Our results suggest that the temporal and spatial dynamics of the diversity and community composition of soil organisms can be predicted by the acoustic complexity of soil soundscapes. This opens up the possibility of using soil soundscape analysis as a noninvasive and easy-to-use method for soil biodiversity monitoring programs.

AB  - More than half of the net primary production in terrestrial ecosystems returns to the soil through leaf litter fall and decomposition. In terrestrial ecosystems, litter constitutes a mixture of mainly senescent foliage from multiple species. Yet, the effect of litter mixing on litter decomposition rate remains ambiguous. Quantification of the soil fauna contribution and inclusion of their interaction with litter could remove the prevailing ambiguity, as soil fauna might influence the direction and magnitude of litter mixture effects on decomposition. We carried out a global meta-analysis to elucidate how soil fauna influenced litter mixture decomposition rate based on 55 published studies with 873 fauna inclusion/exclusion observations in field litterbag experiments. We hypothesized that soil fauna inclusion in litter mixture experiments would cause a positive change in the magnitude of mixed litter decomposition. That is, the presence of soil fauna would lead to synergistic litter mixture effects while the absence of soil fauna would lead to antagonistic litter mixture effects. Furthermore, we hypothesized that soil fauna would have a greater positive impact on the litter mixture effect in environments with low precipitation. While litter mixture had a neutral effect on decomposition on average across studies, non-additive mixture effects were common, with a key role for soil fauna, which generally enhanced decomposition rate compared to the component single-species litters. In contrast, fauna exclusion resulted in diminished decomposition rate overall. The overall synergistic soil fauna effect on litter mixture decomposition increased under low precipitation. Under high precipitation, the litter mixture effect was positive in the absence of soil fauna but non-significant in the presence of fauna. Climate imposes a great effect on litter mixture, with synergistic effects increasing towards the equator. Synthesis. These results highlight the importance of soil fauna in mixed litter decomposition, most strongly in dry environments. In this era of global climate change, where some regions are projected to become drier, soil fauna might compensate the expected slower decomposition of litter by increasingly enhancing litter mixture decomposition.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances and climate change affect abiotic and biotic environmental drivers in forest ecosystems. Global warming impacts the soil moisture content, thus influencing the diversity, abundance and functioning of soil microfauna. However, limited studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of long-term variation in precipitation on soil microfauna. A better understanding of soil microfauna functioning under various precipitation regimes can aid in formulating better prediction models for assessing future climate change impacts. The present study uses a multi-omics approach to capture the variability in the total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), pH, metabolites, microbial biomass and function due to the difference in soil water content mediated by long-term precipitation (30 years) and soil texture differences in two Norway spruce seed orchards. Results showed a positive correlation between TOC, TN, extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) content with higher precipitation, whereas microbial diversity showed an opposite trend. A distinct metabolic profile was observed between the two forest soils. Furthermore, variance partitioning canonical correspondence analysis (VPA) revealed a higher contribution of TOC and TN in shaping the microbial communities than soil pH and conductivity in Norway spruce seed orchards. Our study generates field data for modeling the impact of long-term precipitation variance supplemented by soil texture on soil microbial assemblage and function in Norway spruce stands.

AB  - In arctic and boreal ecosystems, ground bryophytes play an important role in regulating carbon (C) exchange between vast belowground C stores and the atmosphere. Climate is changing particularly fast in these high-latitude regions, but it is unclear how altered precipitation regimes will affect C dynamics in the bryosphere (i.e. the ground moss layer including senesced moss, litter and associated biota) and the closely associated upper humus layer, and how these effects will vary across contrasting environmental conditions. Here, we set up a greenhouse experiment in which mesocosms were assembled containing samples of the bryosphere, dominated by the feather moss Hylocomium splendens, and the upper humus layer, that were collected from across a boreal forest chronosequence in northern Sweden which varies strongly in nutrient availability, productivity and soil biota. We tested the effect of variation in precipitation volume and frequency on CO2 exchange and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export, and on moss growth. As expected, reduced precipitation volume and frequency lowered net CO2 efflux, DOC export and moss growth. However, by regulating moisture, the lower bryosphere and humus layers often mediated how precipitation volume and frequency interacted to drive C dynamics. For example, less frequent precipitation reduced moss growth only when precipitation volume was low. When volume was high, high moisture content of the humus layer helped avoid moss desiccation. Variation in precipitation regime affected C cycling consistently in samples collected across the chronosequence, despite large environmental variation along the sequence. This suggests that the bryosphere exerts a strong buffering effect on environmental variation at the forest floor, which leads to similar responses of C cycling to external perturbations across highly contrasting ecosystems. As such, our study indicates that projected increases in droughts and ground evapotranspiration in high-latitude regions resulting from climate change will consistently reduce C losses from moss-dominated ecosystems.

AB  - Fire has always been a driving factor of life on Earth. Now that mankind has definitely joined the other environmental forces in shaping the planet, lots of species are threatened by human-induced variation in fire regimes. Soil-dwelling organisms, i.e., those organisms that primarily live in soil, suffer the numerous and different consequences of fire occurrence that are, however, often overlooked compared to those on vegetation and wildlife. Most of these organisms live in the uppermost soil layer, where fire-imposed temperatures on the ground are the highest insofar as they are lethal or dangerously upset natural habitats.
   This contribution is a reasoned collation of findings from a number of works conducted worldwide that aims to gain insight into the immediate and longer-term impacts of single or repeated wild or prescribed fires on one group of soil-dwelling organisms or more.
   In fire-prone ecosystems, fire is a controlling factor of soil biota biodiversity and activity, but also where it is infrequent its ecological footprint can be substantial and lasting. Generally, the immediate fire impact on soil biota is strictly related to the peak temperatures reached on the ground and their duration, and on a set of soil properties and water content. Vertebrates can escape overheating death by running away, searching for wet niches or burrowing deep into soil. Invertebrates and microorganisms, which have little or no mobility, succumb more easily to fire, but make up for this intrinsic vulnerability thanks to their greater fecundity at the population level.
   Fire or burn severity, which can generally be defined as loss of organic matter aboveground and belowground, is the key factor of the indirect fire effects on soil-dwelling biota; whereas controlled burns do not often imply any substantial and lasting shift from the original situation, extreme and vast wildfires can have major consequences that may be severer than direct killing. In fact lairs are devastated, nutrient pools are heavily affected, food webs are upset, soil temperature and moisture regimes change, and toxic pyrogenic compounds remain in soil. All types of organisms can recolonise the burned area from their sanctuaries, provided that land use does not change, e.g., to pastures or arable fields, and prompt enough vegetation re-sprouting and/or encroachment prevent substantial soil erosion. Each major taxon has genera or species with useful traits and behaviours to resist fire or to recover from its unwelcome environmental legacy sooner than others. If burned soil does not undergo other fires that occur too closely together for the typical fire regime of that particular area, most of its living components are generally capable of returning to pre-fire levels in times that depend on a series of factors, such as fire severity and post-fire rainfall.

AB  - The degraded areas in Southern Brazil are undergoing rapid conversion from abandoned fields into agroforestry system. Our focus was to investigate the impact of land use and soil properties on soil fauna and quality in an agroforestry system and a natural ecosystem. The agroforestry system had the presence of Cicadidae (0.1 ind trap(-1)), Diplura (0.01 ind trap(-1)), Gryllidae (0.2 ind trap(-1)), Gyrinidae (0.07 ind trap(-1)), and Larvae (0.3 ind trap(-1)), and it presents lower SOC (less 44.3%) and higher total N (more 29.8%) and P contents (more 68.8%) when compared with the natural ecosystem. Richness and diversity declined (less than 16.3 and 31.8%, respectively) with increasing soil pH. Natural ecosystem showed the greatest diversity (H' = 2.44) of soil fauna. A negative correlation was observed between diversity and soil pH (-0.91), and positive correlations among diversity and SOC (0.97), richness (0.88), and dominance (0.93). In conclusion, fauna abundance, precipitation, and soil pH played essential roles in soil quality through ecosystem services, habitat, and energy provision, which in turn promoted the entire soil food web. Thus, the findings in the agroforestry system and natural ecosystem help us to understand how land uses impact soil fauna, and soil quality.

AB  - Tree-dominated, forest gardens (FGs) are an ancient, tropical agricultural land use that farmers continue to practice and value. Knowing why farmers value FGs is important because this can increase livelihood security and the skillful governance of land. We chose Sri Lanka to investigate farmers' values for land, contextual factors that effect valuation, stressors that impact agriculture, and farmers' current and future response strategies. Mixed methods were used to collect data from 85 farming households in landholdings across nine locations of the Intermediate agroecological zone (1750-2500 mm). Landholdings comprise land uses with short-term, annual, and semi-perennial crops (paddy, swidden, and cash crop plots) and long-term, perennial or tree crops (FGs, plantations). Farmers' values were categorised, ranked, and aligned with Utility, Environmental, Aesthetic, Intrinsic, Option and Bequest themes of the Total Economic Value framework (TEV). Farmers give the highest importance to Utility (income, food) and Environmental (friendly biodiversity, leaf litter and soil fertility) values mainly from tree crops. Timber and fuelwood are biological assets that can be optionally converted to cash. Farmers have Intrinsic values (contentment, tranquility, pride) for land bequeathed to future generations. Nevertheless, since livelihoods are stressed by climate variability and extreme events, animal and insect pests, and labour scarcities, farmers adopt diverse response strategies. Of these, farmers favour long-term crop cultivation because trees are relatively resilient to droughts, floods, animal, and insect pests, and require less labour. This study validates why farmers' pluralistic values for land, trees, and biodiversity must be integrated into national decision-and policy-making for agriculture, forest and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - ObjectivesAltitude integrates changes in environmental conditions that determine shifts in vegetation, including temperature, precipitation, solar radiation and edaphogenetic processes. In turn, vegetation alters soil biophysical properties through litter input, root growth, microbial and macrofaunal interactions. The belowground traits of plant communities modify soil processes in different ways, but it is not known how root traits influence soil biota at the community level. We collected data to investigate how elevation affects belowground community traits and soil microbial and faunal communities. This dataset comprises data from a temperate climate in France and a twin study was performed in a tropical zone in Mexico.Data descriptionThe paper describes soil physical and chemical properties, climatic variables, plant community composition and species abundance, plant community traits, soil microbial functional diversity and macrofaunal abundance and diversity. Data are provided for six elevations (1400-2400 m) ranging from montane forest to alpine prairie. We focused on soil biophysical properties beneath three dominant plant species that structure local vegetation. These data are useful for understanding how shifts in vegetation communities affect belowground processes, such as water infiltration, soil aggregation and carbon storage. Data will also help researchers understand how plant communities adjust to a changing climate/environment.

AB  - Land as a whole, and soil, in particular, plays a critical function in the climate system. The various types of land use, especially agriculture and forestry, account for nearly a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the world's soil is under pressure from many factors, including climate change and land use change. Increases in temperature, prolonged drought and floods put pressure on the soil. In order to contribute to a better understanding of these interactions, we conducted a review combining a narrative-focused approach, selecting examples worldwide, and a bibliometric analysis (VosViewer software). This review reports on a study that analyses how climate change and land use change may negatively influence soil biodiversity and related services. It also outlines some of the actions needed to increase the resilience of soil biodiversity in the context of a changing climate. Some key findings are: 1) Well-managed soils are critical for resilient production systems. 2) Integrated agricultural production systems have gained prominence as climate-resilient production systems. 3) Agricultural zoning may be a valuable tool in integrated systems to minimise the effects of climate change. However, it is vital to continuously monitor environmental variations so producers can be more prepared for climate change and extreme events. Finally, adequate water management is essential for soil functioning under climate change aggravating water scarcity. An intersectoral approach between critical sectors facilitates comprehensive water management.

AB  - AimsSoil fauna play a key role in the litter decomposition process in two ways; directly via fragmentation and consumption of the litter, and indirectly through changes in soil structure and the activity of microorganisms. The study aimed at better understanding how soil fauna affects the release of nutrients from litter.MethodsWe conducted a litter decomposition experiment using litterbags of three mesh sizes (0.01 mm, 1 mm, and 4 mm), and chemical treatments (no naphthalene; naphthalene application) to assess soil fauna effect on nutrient release in a poplar plantation in eastern China over a two-year period from Jan 2019 to Dec 2020.ResultsWe found that the contribution of soil fauna to the mass loss of poplar leaf litter was 29% over the two-year period, and the contribution was more pronounced within the first four months. Soil macrofauna and meso-/micro- fauna contributed similarly to leaf litter mass loss, while microbial decomposition contributed the most to the decomposition process. The presence of soil fauna significantly promoted the degradation of cellulose and lignin, and accelerated the release of nitrogen at later stages of decomposition. A structural equation model revealed that higher soil fauna abundance not only promoted the litter decay rate directly, but also indirectly through modifying nitrogen and lignin contents.ConclusionsOur results highlight the importance of soil fauna on cellulose and lignin degradation, and the importance of including this when simulating decomposition models for obtaining a better mechanistic understanding of forest litter decomposition.

AB  - Peatlands in anthropogenically transformed landscapes play an important role in biodiversity conservation. Most Baltic raised bogs have been completely destroyed by drainage and peat extraction. Collembolan and plant as-semblages from an old peat mine (post-excavation pits and dykes overgrown by pine trees) were compared to those of intact ombrotrophic raised bog habitats (open bog and bog-pine forest) 70 years after excavation cessation. The plant cover and collembolan structure in regenerating pits were similar to those of the assemblages in natural open raised bogs. Rare tyrphobiont and tyrphofilous Collembola species occurred in both habitats. The assemblages in open bog habitats differed significantly from those in natural pine bog forest and dykes over-grown by pine trees. The assemblages of the natural open raised bog and pine bog forest were the most diverse and included numerous highly specialized Collembola species. The assemblages occurring on wooded dykes were significantly different from those at other peatland sites and were more similar to those of upland pine forests. The analysis of environmental factors (determined by moss Ellenberg numbers) showed that moisture was the most important factor affecting Collembola occurrence in natural and disturbed habitats. The occurrence of moss species also had a significant influence on the species composition of the collembolan assemblages. Our study revealed that seventy years of spontaneous ecosystem regeneration after peat excavation have led to habitat restoration for peat bog mesofauna. These results have important implications for conservation and restoration planning in disturbed peatlands.

AB  - Soil fauna is generally understudied compared to above-ground arthropods, and ants are no exception. Here, we compared a primary and a secondary forest each on two continents using four different sampling methods. Winkler sampling, pitfalls, and four types of above- and below-ground baits (dead, crushed insects; melezitose; living termites; living mealworms/grasshoppers) were applied on four plots (4 x 4 grid points) on each site. Although less diverse than Winkler samples and pitfalls, subterranean baits provided a remarkable ant community. Our baiting system provided a large dataset to systematically quantify strata and dietary specialisation in tropical rainforest ants. Compared to above-ground baits, 10-28% of the species at subterranean baits were overall more common (or unique to) below ground, indicating a fauna that was truly specialised to this stratum. Species turnover was particularly high in the primary forests, both concerning above-ground and subterranean baits and between grid points within a site. This suggests that secondary forests are more impoverished, especially concerning their subterranean fauna. Although subterranean ants rarely displayed specific preferences for a bait type, they were in general more specialised than above-ground ants; this was true for entire communities, but also for the same species if they foraged in both strata.

AB  - Topsoil transposition has been identified as an environmental restoration technique capable of accelerating regeneration in degraded areas. In addition to the seed bank, topsoil contains invertebrates and microorganisms essential in ecological succession. This study evaluated the temporal variation in the macrofauna community structure in an experiment with topsoil transposition. We hypothesized that the morphospecies richness, functional groups and macrofauna biomass would be higher in the plots with topsoil and native vegetation compared with plots with no topsoil. We further hypothesized that the composition of macrofauna community and the proportion of functional groups in the topsoil and the reference plots would become more similar over time. The community was compared between plots that received topsoil, plots that did not receive topsoil and plots in a natural vegetation, over 14 months. The macrofauna biomass and the diversity of functional groups were equivalent in the degraded area and the topsoil. The effect of treatment on richness depended on time, and it was possible to observe higher values of macrofauna richness in the topsoil compared with the degraded area in some months. The compositions of the macrofauna communities in the degraded area and the topsoil showed greater similarity to each other. In contrast, the reference area showed the greatest dissimilarity with the other treatments. In general, the macrofauna community in the topsoil remained more similar to the degraded area. However, in the topsoil plots, we found higher macrofauna richness during rainy months and an increase in predator biomass. In conclusion, the macrofauna community in the topsoil, which has changed over time, presented higher values of morphospecies richness in some months and the increase in predator biomass, indicating an increase in the complexity of the community. Besides, the topsoil can improve biodiversity, but this does not produce the natural communities found at reference sites, in a small-time scale experiment.

AB  - Aim Macroinvertebrates comprise a highly diverse set of taxa with great potential as indicators of soil quality. Communities were sampled at 3,694 sites distributed world-wide. We aimed to analyse the patterns of abundance, composition and network characteristics and their relationships to latitude, mean annual temperature and rainfall, land cover, soil texture and agricultural practices. Location Sites are distributed in 41 countries, ranging from 55 degrees S to 57 degrees N latitude, from 0 to 4,000 m in elevation, with annual rainfall ranging from 500 to >3,000 mm and mean temperatures of 5-32 degrees C. Time period 1980-2018. Major taxa studied All soil macroinvertebrates: Haplotaxida; Coleoptera; Formicidae; Arachnida; Chilopoda; Diplopoda; Diptera; Isoptera; Isopoda; Homoptera; Hemiptera; Gastropoda; Blattaria; Orthoptera; Lepidoptera; Dermaptera; and "others". Methods Standard ISO 23611-5 sampling protocol was applied at all sites. Data treatment used a set of multivariate analyses, principal components analysis (PCA) on macrofauna data transformed by Hellinger's method, multiple correspondence analysis for environmental data (latitude, elevation, temperature and average annual rainfall, type of vegetation cover) transformed into discrete classes, coinertia analysis to compare these two data sets, and bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap tests to evaluate the part of the variance of the macrofauna data attributable to each of the environmental factors. Network analysis was performed. Each pairwise association of taxonomic units was tested against a null model considering local and regional scales, in order to avoid spurious correlations. Results Communities were separated into five clusters reflecting their densities and taxonomic richness. They were significantly influenced by climatic conditions, soil texture and vegetation cover. Abundance and diversity, highest in tropical forests (1,895 +/- 234 individuals/m(2)) and savannahs (1,796 +/- 72 individuals/m(2)), progressively decreased in tropical cropping systems (tree-associated crops, 1,358 +/- 120 individuals/m(2); pastures, 1,178 +/- 154 individuals/m(2); and annual crops, 867 +/- 62 individuals/m(2)), temperate grasslands (529 +/- 60 individuals/m(2)), forests (232 +/- 20 individuals/m(2)) and annual crops (231 +/- 24 individuals/m(2)) and temperate dry forests and shrubs (195 +/- 11 individuals/m(2)). Agricultural management decreased overall abundance by <= 54% in tropical areas and 64% in temperate areas. Connectivity varied with taxa, with dominant positive connections in litter transformers and negative connections with ecosystem engineers and Arachnida. Connectivity and modularity were higher in communities with low abundance and taxonomic richness. Main conclusions Soil macroinvertebrate communities respond to climatic, soil and land-cover conditions. All taxa, except termites, are found everywhere, and communities from the five clusters cover a wide range of geographical and environmental conditions. Agricultural practices significantly decrease abundance, although the presence of tree components alleviates this effect.

AB  - Piper aduncum, a tree species native to the Neotropics, has been introduced to other tropical regions and successfully invades secondary forest in fallow land after small scale slash-and-burn agriculture in Papua New Guinea (PNG). However, the effect of P. aduncum invasion on soil chemical properties as well as soil biota remains poorly understood. To fill this knowledge gap, we compared soil chemistry, soil microbiota and soil fauna between sites invaded by P. aduncum and sites with secondary native vegetation, where P. aduncum absent. Soils under P. aduncum had significantly lower P content at 0-5 cm depth, lower NO3- at 5-10 cm depth and lower N and C content at both depths compared to soil under secondary vegetation where P. aduncum absent. Sites invaded by P. aduncum also harbored lower microbial biomass measured by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, especially at 5-10 cm depth. The composition of microbial communities, based on PLFA and amplicon sequencing methods, also differed between soils invaded and uninvaded by P. aduncum, while soil macrofauna did not show any significant difference in the density of various faunal groups between invaded and uninvaded sites. Furthermore, we studied soil chemistry and foliar nitrogen in food gardens established after clearing of secondary vegetation in sites where P. aduncum had been experimentally excluded for five years. These gardens did not differ in soil chemistry compared to the control gardens where P. aduncum was not cleared. However, P. aduncum removal was associated with a higher N content in the leaves of sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas), but not bananas (Musa spp.). Our results suggest that P. aduncum has negative effect on soil microbiota and may slowdown nutrient turnover and availability as well as growth of plants on invaded soil. This finding requires further attention and may have practical implication for food gardening in tropical rainforests.

AB  - The Republic of Ghana is among the 50 countries in the world with the highest biodiversity of plant and animal species. The network of forest reserves in the country is the basis for the rich biodiversity conservation. One third of the Ghana's territory was covered with natural rainforests at the beginning of the 20th century. These forests are now classified as reserves and vulnerable areas. Ghana has two main types of vegetation: savannahs and forests. Their features are determined by the amount of precipitation, moisture level, geology and soils. An inventory of Ghana's forest resources revealed that the area of forests had been reduced by 19 %. Biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation, ecotourism and the improvement of living conditions have become important areas in Ghana's forestry. This has led to significant changes in forest management and logging technologies. The large-scale afforestation programs initiated in the country support the conservation of many populations of flora and fauna. The forest sector includes forest management and woodworking industry, which contribute significantly to currency earnings in Ghana via the export of wood products.

AB  - The current and expected expansion of agriculture in the drylands of Mexico, together with the decrease in precipitation occurring in the country, likely affect ecosystem processes and will bring great challenges for the suitability of rainfed agriculture for smallholder farmers. Here, we assessed metrics of the soil C, N, and P cycles, as well as soil microbial diversity, under rainfed maize and common bean cropping in arid and semiarid regions of central Mexico. The soil enzymatic vector angles of cultivated plots in both regions were above 45 & DEG;, suggesting P limitation for microbial growth and crop productivity. Although changes were not observed in the intensity of this P-limitation with aridity, we found a negative effect of drought increase on the concentration of soil organic C and total N, with consequences for the C, N, and P balance in soils. Increasing aridity leads to the homogenization of microbial diversity. Considering a scenario in which decreases in mean annual precipitation would uncouple the biogeochemical cycles and homogenize soil biodiversity, the ecological implications could be an increase in the vulnerability of agricultural ecosystems to drought, with negative consequences for the suitability of rainfed agriculture in the drylands of central Mexico.

AB  - Mesocosm studies in temperate soils indicate that soil fauna may promote accumulation of C in mineral soil. To test if this effect apply also in tropics we used field mesocosms that were either accessible or inaccessible to soil fauna. To explore potential interaction with traditional land use we locate these mesocosms along a succession gradient following traditional swidden agriculture in the lowland tropical rain forest of Papua New Guinea. Soil fauna densities did not show any significant changes along the succession gradient. Litter fall in primary forest was significantly higher than in younger succession stages. Litter stock on the soil surface follows the same pattern as litter fall. Litter stock was a few percent higher than annual litter fall suggests that litter removal from soil surface takes slightly over one year. Our Mesocosm experiment shows the same speed of litter removal (about one year). Litter removal from surface and its incorporation of organic matter into mineral soil is faster in the fauna treatment compared to the non-fauna treatment. Overall loss of C from the system was higher when fauna was absent. Fauna reduced overall loss of C from the soil in average for more then 40%. In conclusion soil fauna play important role in organic matter transformation and soil C storage in tropical ecosystem. Fauna removal sub-stantially reduce overall soil C storage.

AB  - Objectives Soil fauna plays a crucial role in contributing to litter breakdown, accelerating the decomposition rate and enhancing the biogeochemical cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. Comprehending the specific fauna role of functional species in litter decomposition is challenging due to their vast numbers and diversity. Climate and litter quality are widely acknowledged as dominant drives of litter decomposition across large spatial scales. However, the pattern of climate and litter quality modulates the effect of soil fauna on litter decomposition remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted an extensive analysis using data from 81 studies to investigate how climate and litter traits affects soil fauna in the decomposition.Data description The paper describes fauna body size, climate zones (tropical, subtropical and temperate), ecosystem types (forest, grassland, wetland and farmland), soil types (sand, loam and clay), decomposed duration (< 180, 180-360, > 360 days), litter initial traits, average annual temperature and precipitation. The litter traits encompass various parameters such as concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, lignin, cellulose, total phenol, condensed tannin, hydrolysable tannin and other nutrient traits. These comprehensive datasets provide valuable insights into the role of soil fauna on the decomposition at global scale. Furthermore, the data will give researchers keys to assess how climate, litter quality and soil fauna interact to determine decomposition rates.

AB  - Soil organisms drive major ecosystem functions by mineralising carbon and releasing nutrients during decomposition processes, which supports plant growth, aboveground biodiversity and, ultimately, human nutrition. Soil ecologists often operate with functional groups to infer the effects of individual taxa on ecosystem functions and services. Simultaneous assessment of the functional roles of multiple taxa is possible using food-web reconstructions, but our knowledge of the feeding habits of many taxa is insufficient and often based on limited evidence. Over the last two decades, molecular, biochemical and isotopic tools have improved our understanding of the feeding habits of various soil organisms, yet this knowledge is still to be synthesised into a common functional framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the feeding habits of consumers in soil, including protists, micro-, meso- and macrofauna (invertebrates), and soil-associated vertebrates. We have integrated existing functional group classifications with findings gained with novel methods and compiled an overarching classification across taxa focusing on key universal traits such as food resource preferences, body masses, microhabitat specialisation, protection and hunting mechanisms. Our summary highlights various strands of evidence that many functional groups commonly used in soil ecology and food-web models are feeding on multiple types of food resources. In many cases, omnivory is observed down to the species level of taxonomic resolution, challenging realism of traditional soil food-web models based on distinct resource-based energy channels. Novel methods, such as stable isotope, fatty acid and DNA gut content analyses, have revealed previously hidden facets of trophic relationships of soil consumers, such as food assimilation, multichannel feeding across trophic levels, hidden trophic niche differentiation and the importance of alternative food/prey, as well as energy transfers across ecosystem compartments. Wider adoption of such tools and the development of open interoperable platforms that assemble morphological, ecological and trophic data as traits of soil taxa will enable the refinement and expansion of the multifunctional classification of consumers in soil. The compiled multifunctional classification of soil-associated consumers will serve as a reference for ecologists working with biodiversity changes and biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, making soil food-web research more accessible and reproducible.

AB  - Soil health is the foundation for the maintenance of ecosystem stability and multifunctionality. It is necessary to identify the key indicators of soil health that indicate ecosystem multifunctionality against anthropogenic dis-turbances such as land use change. Many studies have shown the pivotal role of soil biodiversity in maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality. However, the key role of soil multidiversity (including different body size soil organisms across multitrophic levels) in affecting ecosystem functions is poorly understood. We have imple-mented a multitrophic perspective to study soil multidiversity by including bacteria, fungi, nematodes (5 feeding types), and arthropods (thripidae, poduridae, and others). Here we show that a multitrophic approach for soil biodiversity assessment is important to highlight trophic interactions and their subsequent effects on the soil multidiversity-ecosystem multifunctionality (MEF) relationship. We postulate that soil multidiversity promotes soil health and thus drives the MEF relationship. We assessed soil multidiversity, 11 variables for ecosystem functions, and ecological network stability (reflected by co-occurrence network patterns) in rubber plantations differing in land-use intensity represented by monoculture (MRP), high (RHD) and low (RLD) diversity of other plant species. We also included tropical rainforest (TRF) as a reference system to compare our results. Results showed that soil multidiversity, multifunctionality, and soil network stability significantly improved in RHD as compared to MRP. Soil multidiversity rather than single diversity component had strong positive effects on multifunctionality. More specifically, we found that the relationship between soil multidiversity and multi -functionality was seasonally dependent on the soil attributes and the body size of soil organisms. We observed a negative correlation between large body size organisms and soil nutrients content in the dry season while a positive correlation between small body size soil organisms and enzymatic activities in the rain season. Partic-ularly, we emphasized the role of soil multidiversity in enhancing ecosystem multifunctionality and stability via its prominent impacts on soil health. Our study elucidates that accurate identification of soil health indicators is an important approach to imply remedial management strategies to maintain soil health and MEF relationship in managed ecosystems such as rubber plantations.

AB  - The review paper aims to learn more about the effects of abiotic variables on myrmeco fauna diversity and distribution in different eco environments. Additionally, the study examines in order to produce information on myrmecofauna disturbance dynamics and enable us to see if habitat eradication is reflected in ant diversity or its lifestyle helps to buffer against these perturbations. The study explores an insight into natural history visual examinations where ant pest relationship can be explored further and can point to an incipient role of agricultural crops in ant conservation, balancing economic gains with augmenting ant species diversity. The study reveals significant associations between abiotic factors such as temperature, rainfall patterns, and ant diversity and abundance. Ant communities respond predictably to land changes in agroecosystems, making them potential bioindicators of soil condition and management. The findings emphasize the importance of preserving biodiversity for sustainable development and ecological stability. Further investigations into abiotic-ant relationships can guide conservation efforts and ecosystem management.

AB  - Sustainable management of secondary forests for timber production offers the opportunity to combine nature-based climate change mitigation with direct improvement of human livelihoods in the tropics, but this dual potential has rarely been explored. We characterized aboveground biomass (AGB) in secondary forests (SF) in Nicaragua and Costa Rica in whole stands (ecological potential), individual trees of timber species (total timber potential), and currently harvestable timber (harvestable timber potential). We also linked the three types of AGB potential to climate and soil factors. Data on 302 sample plots were collected, most from national forest inventories (NFIs) concerning 168 plots in Nicaragua and 134 plots in Costa Rica.
   We analyzed data from individuals >= 20 cm dbh, estimating biomass from field measurements of stem diameters, and wood density and tree height estimates from the BIOMASS package in R. We obtained climate data from CHELSA, soil data from the ISRIC world soils database and determined the relationship between the three AGB potentials and environmental variables using exploratory principal components analysis and general linear mixed models (GLMMs).
   A mean 51 Mg ha(-1) AGB was found to be stored in trees >= 20 cm dbh in dry forests and 68 Mg ha(-1) in wet forests. Maximum values were > 250 Mg ha(-1) in both biomes, similar to primary forest values from the NFIs. Timber potential was high at 84% of the mean ecological potential of the study plots, with 73% in the currently harvestable category. Overall, both ecological and total timber potential AGB were significantly higher in wet than in dry forests, whereas currently harvestable timber potential was significantly higher in dry than in wet forests. The best GLMMs showed R-2 = 0.31, 0.24 and 0.27 for ecological, total timber and harvestable timber potentials, respectively (P < 0.0001). All three models included soil clay and silt fractions, soil C/N ratio, mean annual precipitation and temperature seasonality. The GLMM for ecological potential included soil pH and climatic water deficit, while those for the two timber potentials included mean annual temperature. Overall, GLMMs indicate increasing timber AGB potential with increasing rainfall, decreasing climatic seasonality, and soil fertility. All three AGB potentials were significantly higher in Costa Rica than in Nicaragua in both biomes. This observed non-environmental "country effect" requires further study.

AB  - Litter decomposition is a fundamental ecosystem service that can be affected by the nonadditive effect of litter mixing. We hypothesize that drought will slow the decomposition of litter mixtures due to a decline in com-plementary resource use. The presence of soil fauna could favor litter decomposition and mitigate the drought effect, but this depends on soil nitrogen (N) availability to soil fauna. To test these hypotheses, we compared the decomposition of single and all possible litter mixtures (11) of four leaf litter types in litterbags with three mesh sizes (i.e., 0.05-mm, 1-mm, and 5-mm) in control and treatment plots (drought, N addition or both) in an N -enriched bamboo forest ecosystem. Increasing the litter species richness moderately accelerated litter carbon (C) and N loss. The positive effect of litter diversity on decomposition was due to more complementary resource use. Both drought and N addition slowed the C and N loss from diverse litter mixtures, and N addition exacerbated the negative drought effect in this N-enriched forest. These negative effects of abiotic manipulation on litter decomposition were partly attributed to less complementary resource use. Specifically, the complementarity effects of litter mixing on C loss declined significantly, by 50%, with drought, and was even more pronounced in the drought and N addition treantment. The three-way interactions among drought, N addition, and decomposer communities demonstrated that the presence of soil fauna supports complementary resource use and alleviates thedrought constraint, but not the restriction in decomposition caused by N addition in this N-enriched forest. These findings have implications for projected decomposition rates under future global change scenarios, since they suggest that environmental changes affect decomposition through direct effects on soil biota and indirect impacts on within-and among-trophic interactions in forest ecosystems.

AB  - Context. Acacia longifolia is an aggressive invader, disrupting habitats and communities worldwide. Understanding what drives its expansion is of paramount importance. Key functional traits include fast growth and the presence of bacterial symbionts performing nitrogen fixation. Aims. To address early plant development of A. longifolia under different soils and growth conditions (water and nutrition availability), establishing the key factors that influence above and belowground responses. Methods. Plants were grown in pots with soils collected from forest, agricultural and dune areas in relative proximity, in a controlled experiment designed to study water effect and nutrient availability on early growth. Growth parameters included shoot and root length, nodule number and weight. Bacteria were isolated from nodules for genetic diversity evaluation. Photosynthetic pigments and isotopic nitrogen and carbon analyses were performed to address nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis. Key results. Soil origin influenced plant growth and bacterial diversity. Largest plant development was achieved in forest soils with added nutrition and water. Plants from agricultural soil displayed higher aboveground development; however, belowground nodule number and bacterial biodiversity decreased, possibly due to anthropogenic activities. Forest soil promoted belowground development and bacterial diversity. In dune soils overall growth was lower and nitrogen fixation was higher. Conclusion. Abiotic factors influenced juvenile acacia development; nutrition acts as a growth enhancer, and soil origin, including its microbial communities, can be considered a development modulator. Bacterial diversity varied according to soil type. Implications. Several above and belowground interactions showed the need for an integrative perspective to understand acacias invasive potential.

AB  - Coarse woody debris on the forest floor contributes to maintenance of forest biodiversity and long-term ecosystem productivity. Down wood is often dispersed over harvested sites during logging activities, thereby leaving piles of postharvest debris as "excess" material at landings and roadsides. These wood residues may be burned in most jurisdictions in North America to reduce a perceived fire hazard. The fire hazard debate needs to acknowledge the documented benefits of woody debris retention while striking a balance among biodiversity, bioenergy, and alternative uses for debris, while reducing ignitions by humans. The burning of excess woody debris also creates smoke, causes the release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and creates human health issues, particularly for vulnerable individuals. The relationship of wildfire smoke to human health problems is well documented. However, there is no scientific evidence showing that postharvest debris piles are ignition points for forest fires, other than those caused by humans. Wood residues from forest harvesting or natural disturbance wood from wildfire and insect outbreaks may be used as renewable biomass "feedstocks" that could help improve energy supplies and reduce GHG emissions. If not marketable, the management of postharvest debris should seek alternative outlets that do not dispose of debris by burning, but still meet fire hazard abatement requirements. The construction of woody debris structures (e.g., piles and windrows) built at the time of forest harvesting and log processing, or later at the site preparation stages, has positive benefits for wildlife habitat and forest biodiversity. A windrow or series of piles may connect patches and reserves of mature forest and riparian areas on clearcut openings. Piles and windrows have consistently provided habitat on new clearcuts for southern red-backed voles (Myodes gapperi) and Microtus voles, as well as a host of other forest-floor small mammal species, at least up to 12 years postconstruction. Woody debris provides important habitat for foraging and cover attributes for marten (Martes americana), weasels (Mustela spp.), and other furbearers. A list of "What to do?" and "When and Where?" with options for construction of woody debris habitats: poorest, good, better, and best are given. In the cases where fire risk from humans is minimized and there are no marketable wood products, eight alternative management scenarios for postharvest woody debris are provided. These include: (1) piles for wildlife habitat; (2) distribution of debris in partial cut forests; (3) machinery to break up and crush debris; (4) protection of riparian zones with barriers for cattle; (5) construction of range fencing; (6) reclamation of landings and skid-trails; (7) soil fertility and reduction in weed competition and drought for planted conifers; and (8) slope stabilization and revegetation. Advantages and disadvantages (if known) are given for each alternative. A flow chart for the fate of excess postharvest woody debris with respect to fire hazard abatement and markets or nonmarkets is given.

AB  - We studied communities of leaf litter weevils along a 2000 m elevation gradient in El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, northeastern Mexico, an area where Nearctic and Neotropical biotas overlap. After achieving high inventory completeness (0.922 site sample coverage), we encountered 81 weevil morphospecies, of which 55 were known to be leaf litter specialists. The diversity of leaf litter weevils increased with elevation. Beta diversity across the elevational gradient was mostly explained by species turnover rather than nestedness. The interaction between forest structure (measured as median DBH of trees) and precipitation seasonality explained more than 20% of the variation in weevil species richness: weevil richness showed a negative relationship with tree DBH and was positively associated with low climate seasonality variation, characteristics of tropical montane cloud forests. In contrast with insect taxa such as ants and dung beetles, which attain their highest richness at lower elevations, leaf litter weevil richness peaked at 1600 m. These results suggest that most litter weevil species are highly associated with a particular elevation range and the overall pattern of richness increasing with elevation is probably the result of an association of many weevil species with tropical montane cloud forest habitats, which occur close to the top of the mountain.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.
   Se estudiaron comunidades de gorgojos (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) de la hojarasca a lo largo de un gradiente altitudinal de 2000 m en la Reserva de la Biosfera El Cielo, Mexico. Una zona donde se empalman biotas Neartica y Neotropical. Se obtuvo una alta completitud del inventario (0.922 cobertura de la muestra), se encontraron 81 morfoespecies de gorgojos, de las cuales 55 fueron especialistas en hojarasca. La diversidad de gorgojos de la hojarasca incremento con la altitud. La diversidad beta en el gradiente altitudinal se explico principalmente por el recambio de especies en lugar del anidamiento. La interaccion entre la estructura del bosque (medida como la mediana del diametro a la altura del pecho de los arboles) y la estacionalidad de las lluvias, explico mas del 20% de la variacion en la riqueza de especies de gorgojos. La riqueza taxonomica mostro una relacion negativa con el diametro de los troncos de los arboles y estuvo positivamente asociada con una baja variacion en la estacionalidad de las lluvias, caracteristicas de los bosques de niebla tropicales de montana. En contraste con otros insectos como hormigas y escarabajos estercoleros, que alcanzan su mayor riqueza taxonomica en elevaciones bajas, la riqueza de gorgojos de la hojarasca alcanzo su maximo a los 1600 m. Estos resultados sugieren que la mayoria de las especies de gorgojos de la hojarasca estan altamente asociados a un rango de elevacion delimitado. El patron general de incremento de la riqueza con la elevacion es el resultado de una asociacion de multiples especies de gorgojos con habitats de bosques de niebla tropicales de montana, los cuales se encuentran cerca de la cima de la montana.
   In a mountain in northeastern Mexico, leaf litter weevil richness increased with elevation peaking in a tropical montane cloud forest habitat. This pattern is unlike many invertebrate groups, whose species richness decreases with elevation. Our study highlights the need to further study under-researched insect taxa, to better comprehend elevational gradient patterns.image

AB  - 1. Soil infiltration capacity determines the partitioning of precipitation into infiltration and overland flow and is therefore an important soil hydrological characteristic. Water infiltration through soil is facilitated by macropores created by roots and soil macrofauna. In clay-rich soils, such as those of the tropical forests of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, most infiltration occurs via these preferential flow pathways. 2. We evaluated the effects of dung beetle tunnelling on infiltration and macropore creation (depth and width of the flow pathways) in tropical forest soils in Sabah. Using mesocosms, we applied three treatments (i) soil-only, (ii) dung-only, (iii) dung + dung beetles, and measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (i.e., the steady-state infiltration rate) after 0, 5 and 10 days, and assessed depth and width of infiltration pathways by applying a blue dye tracer. 3. The steady-state infiltration rate increased in the presence of dung beetles, though differences among treatments were only statistically significant after 10 days. After 5 days of dung beetle presence, infiltrated water had reached a greater depth than the control mesocosms without beetles. However, there were no differences in the width of infiltration pathways among treatments. 4. These results reveal the important, but under studied roles of dung beetles on soil hydrological functioning, that may have consequences for nutrient cycling and plant productivity. Further, our findings indicate that the novel application of an established hydrological method-blue dye tracer-can provide interesting and reliable results for macrofauna-soil interaction studies.

AB  - Belowground life relies on plant litter, while its linkage to living roots had long been understudied, and remains unknown in the tropics. Here, we analysed the response of 30 soil animal groups to root trenching and litter removal in rainforest and plantations in Sumatra, and found that roots are similarly important to soil fauna as litter. Trenching effects were stronger in soil than in litter, with an overall decrease in animal abundance in rainforest by 42% and in plantations by 30%. Litter removal little affected animals in soil, but decreased the total abundance by 60% in rainforest and rubber plantations but not in oil palm plantations. Litter and root effects on animal group abundances were explained by body size or vertical distribution. Our study quantifies principle carbon pathways in soil food webs under tropical land use, providing the basis for mechanistic modelling and ecosystem-friendly management of tropical soils.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that climate change will strongly affect tea cultivation. It will be one of the challenging issues, particularly for the tea plantations of Assam, India. Based on a questionnaire survey carried out in four major tea-growing regions of Assam, viz., Upper Assam, South Bank, North Bank and Cachar, the study analyses tea growers' awareness of climate change, its impact on tea, adaptive approaches undertaken and future strategies. Majority of respondents were aware of climate change and its effect on tea production. Tea growers attributed prolong drought, excessive precipitation within a short period, temperature extremes, increase in insect and disease infestation, the emergence of new insect pest species, increased weed infestation and wind velocity as underlying effects of climate change. Results also specified that tea growers had a positive approach towards adaptive management strategies to mitigate climate change. Adaptive measures executed to combat climate change included rainwater harvesting, irrigation, afforestation, biodiversity conservation, soil mulching and creation of wind barriers. As future management strategies, tea growers have opted to gradually replace synthetic fertilisers with organic manures and pesticides, construct anti-erosion measures along riversides and embankments, generate awareness programs among the workers and other residents on conserving biodiversity, generate clean energy for tea production and cultivate climate tolerant/resistant cultivars. The present study will be helpful to make more informed future strategies regarding best practices for tea cultivation under a changing climate for tea-growing regions all over the world.

AB  - The soil fauna of the tropics remains one of the least known components of the biosphere. Long-term monitoring of this fauna is hampered by the lack of taxonomic expertise and funding. These obstacles may potentially be lifted with DNA metabarcoding. To validate this approach, we studied the ants, springtails and termites of 100 paired soil samples from Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The fauna was extracted with Berlese-Tullgren funnels and then either sorted with traditional taxonomy and known, individual DNA barcodes ("traditional samples") or processed with metabarcoding ("metabarcoding samples"). We detected 49 ant, 37 springtail and 34 termite species with 3.46 million reads of the COI gene, at a mean sequence length of 233 bp. Traditional identification yielded 80, 111 and 15 species of ants, springtails and termites, respectively; 98%, 37% and 100% of these species had a Barcode Index Number (BIN) allowing for direct comparison with metabarcoding. Ants were best surveyed through traditional methods, termites were better detected by metabarcoding, and springtails were equally well detected by both techniques. Species richness was underestimated, and faunal composition was different in metabarcoding samples, mostly because 37% of ant species were not detected. The prevalence of species in metabarcoding samples increased with their abundance in traditional samples, and seasonal shifts in species prevalence and faunal composition were similar between traditional and metabarcoding samples. Probable false positive and negative species records were reasonably low (13-18% of common species). We conclude that metabarcoding of samples extracted with Berlese-Tullgren funnels appear suitable for the long-term monitoring of termites and springtails in tropical rainforests. For ants, metabarcoding schemes should be complemented by additional samples of alates from Malaise or light traps.

AB  - For precipitation to reach the surface of vegetated ecosystems, it must first pass through the canopy. A portion of precipitation, stemflow, drains down branches to the stem. This stemflow may wash canopy-dwelling animals (metazoans) into the litter and soils below; however, stemflow metazoans transport has typically been ignored in past research. In fact, the visual presence of metazoans in stemflow collection bins was reported as "contamination" in past research. Thus, we know little about these organisms' transfer from plant canopies to the surface. To investigate this topic, we monitored metazoan concentrations and composition within stemflow that drained from eight urban tree species (n = 3 per species) over 12 months. Annual (+/- SE) stemflow recorded from all 24 sampled trees was 19.6 (+/- 3.3) mm (2.3% rainfall). Analysis of 288 samples found 1,307 individuals distributed into seven classes (16 orders) and one organism at phylum level. Considering all trees (n = 24), the annual mean metazoan density in stemflow was 8.6 individuals L-1. Among tree species, there were considerable variations, ranging from 1.0 to 17 individuals L-1. Annual metazoan transport per tree ranged from 20 to 376 individuals m(-2) y(-1). The most common taxa observed in stemflow from this site included Arachnida (10%), Collembola (33%) and Insecta (56%). Variability in metazoan density within and across species was high, but individual trees with the highest metazoan stemflow density and flux were those with large diameter and exfoliating bark structure. This study demonstrates that stemflow can transport a substantial and diverse meso- and macro-fauna to the surface of urban forests. Future work may be merited on the fate and/or role of these metazoans in litter and soil systems.

AB  - Agricultural expansion is among the main threats to biodiversity and functions of tropical ecosystems. It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated & UDelta;C-13 values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs. Our results highlight the strong restructuring of soil food webs with the conversion of rainforest into plantations threatening soil functioning and ecosystem stability in the long term.

AB  - Natural resources are a valuable component of traditional food systems that contributes to food and nutrition. The distribution and consumption patterns of these natural resources still needs exploration for follow-up research and optimum utilisation. The aim of this study was to investigate the agro-ecological distribution and the consumption of wild harvested edible insects, indigenous fruits and vegetables in rural Zimbabwe. Secondary data generated from a cross-sectional survey targeting 11,973 randomly selected households rural districts was used. The results revealed that at least 14 wild harvested edible insect species, 26 indigenous fruits and 10 indigenous vegetables are commonly consumed. The results showed that the highly consumed indigenous fruits, vegetables and insects were widely distributed in all provinces irrespective of the agro-ecological region and varied due to rainfall pattern and also due to soil type. However, their distribution was in some cases restricted to specific administrative boundaries or provinces. Consumption pattern and preference for some insects, fruits and vegetables varied with province. The distribution and consumption data presented in this study offers an opportunity to advocate for the conservation, production, processing and promotion of specific species in districts by relevant stakeholders and can be used as an advocacy tool for policymakers.

AB  - The growth of urban landscapes has genarally reduced biodiversity worldwide. Invertebrates have explored different environments, and it usually takes different sampling techniques to get a representative sample of the species assemblage in a given location. Some studies have sought to determine the minimum necessary number of sampling techniques, including ecological relationships or costs to guide the sampling protocol. In the Amazon, the effect of soil characteristics on invertebrate distribution is well known. We evaluated if sampling techniques have a complementary effect on the detection of pseudoscorpion assemblages and tested whether environmental variables affect the distribution of pseudoscorpion species. The study sites were two urban forest fragments in the city of Manaus, in the central Amazon. In each fragment, we sampled 20 palm trees using the beating technique, and installed transects with 12 sampling points for collection of soil and litter samples for extraction of arthropods in a Berlese funnel and a Winkler extractor, respectively. We collected 267 individuals of 11 species of pseudoscorpions. Most records were obtained through the Winkler extraction in both fragments. The assemblage from the palm trees was different from that in the edaphic samples. Pseudoscorpion species composition also differed significantly between soil and litter, and was influenced by potassium concentration. The number of species in the fragments and the environmental effect on the distribution of pseudoscorpions was similar to that recorded in environmental protection areas, evidencing that urban forest fragments can serve as an efficient repository of Amazonian pseudoscorpion biodiversity.

AB  - Tropical forests play a fundamental role in mitigating climate change through storage of carbon in above-and below-ground biomass. Their mitigation potential is, however, affected by significant greenhouse gas emissions through tropical deforestation or forest degradation. Mitigating degradation caused by conventional logging is therefore an important challenge for silvicultural management, and various reduced impact logging techniques seek to reduce biomass loss and other logging impacts during forest logging activities. Little knowledge exists about the potential of sustainable management for maintaining and restoring the climate change mitigation capacity of tropical forests. Our research contributes to knowledge about this potential, as our aim is to evaluate the above-ground biomass (AGB) stock of tropical forests managed for sustainable timber production and compare it with that of intact primary forests. We also determine the environmental and spatial factors that influence AGB. We estimated the AGB of 141 permanent sampling plots in Costa Rican tropical forests (71 plots set up in areas managed for timber production forests and 70 plots set up in areas with intact primary forests) using data for the 2000-2015 period. We compared the AGB of timber production forests with that of primary forest using linear mixed models and examined the relationship between forest AGB and climate, soil fertility and spatial variables (PCNM eigenvalues) using variation partitioning (VARPART) and multiple linear regression in the mixed model framework. Mean AGB was higher in forest plots set up in areas managed for timber production than in plots set up in areas with intact primary forests. In VARPART, spatial variables had the strongest effect on AGB with a small but significant effect of soil fertility. Regression showed potassium levels in the soil to be positively related to AGB. There was no significant effect of climate, probably because of the short temperature and precipitation gradients. Sustainable forest management in these Costa Rican forests managed for timber production has enabled them to store as much carbon in biomass as primary forests, due to the low intensity logging and sustainability criteria stipulated by the country's forestry legislation. As a result, sustainable forest management, in addition to providing a sustainable timber ecosystem service, is also a natural climate solution, maintaining the mitigation potential of Costa Rica's tropical forests in the current climate context.

AB  - Windstorms and salvage logging lead to huge soil disturbance in alpine spruce forests, potentially affecting soil-living arthropods. However, the impacts of forest loss and possible interactions with underlying ecological gradients on soil microarthropod communities remain little known, especially across different environmental conditions. Here we used DNA metabarcoding approach to study wind-induced disturbances on forest communities of springtails and soil mites. In particular, we aimed to test the effect of forest soil disturbance on the abundance, richness, species composition, and functional guilds of microarthropods. We sampled 29 pairs of windfall-forest sites across gradients of elevation, precipitation, aspect and slope, 2 years after a massive windstorm, named Vaia, which hit North-Eastern Italy in October 2018. Our results showed that wind-induced disturbances led to detrimental impacts on soil-living communities. Abundance of microarthropods decreased in windfalls, but with interacting effects with precipitation gradients. Operative Taxonomic Units (OTU) richness strongly decreased in post-disturbance sites, particularly affecting plant-feeder trophic guilds. Furthermore, species composition analyses revealed that communities occurring in post-disturbance sites were different to those in undisturbed forests (i.e., stands without wind damage). However, variables at different spatial scales played different roles depending on the considered taxon. Our study contributes to shed light on the impacts on important, but often neglected arthropod communities after windstorm in spruce forests. Effects of forest disturbance are often mediated by underlying large scale ecological gradients, such as precipitation and topography. Massive impacts of stronger and more frequent windstorms are expected to hit forests in the future; given the response we recorded, mediated by environmental features, forest managers need to take site-specific conservation measures.

AB  - Climate and soil factors induce substantial controls over plant biodiversity in stressful ecosystems. Despite of some studies on plant biodiversity in extreme ecosystems including rocky outcrops, simultaneous effects of climate and soil factors have rarely been studied on different facets of biodiversity including taxonomic and functional diversity in these ecosystems. In addition, we know little about plant biodiversity variations in such extreme ecosystems compared to natural environments. It seems that environmental factors acting in different spatial scales specifically influence some facets of plant biodiversity. Therefore, we studied changes in taxonomic and functional diversity along precipitation and soil gradients in both landscapes (i) rocky outcrops and (ii) their nearby rangeland sites in northeast of Iran. In this regard, we considered six sites across precipitation and soil gradients in each landscape, and established 90 1m(2) quadrates in them (i.e. 15 quadrats in each site; 15 x 6 = 90 in each landscape). Then, taxonomic and functional diversity were measured using RaoQ index, FDis and CWM indices. Finally, we assessed impacts of precipitation and soil factors on biodiversity indices in both landscapes by performing regression models and variation partitioning procedure. The patterns of taxonomic diversity similarly showed nonlinear changes along the precipitation and soil factors in both landscapes (i.e. outcrop and rangeland). However, we found a more negative and significant trends of variation in functional diversity indices (except for CWMSLA) across precipitation and soil factors in outcrops than their surrounding rangelands. Variations of plant biodiversity were more explained by precipitation factors in surrounding rangelands, whereas soil factors including organic carbon had more consistent and significant effects on plant biodiversity in outcrops. Therefore, our results represent important impacts of soil factors in structuring plant biodiversity facets in stressful ecosystems. While, environmental factors acting in regional and broad scales such as precipitation generally shape vegetation and plant biodiversity patterns in natural ecosystems. We can conclude that rocky outcrops provide suitable microenvironments to present plant species with similar yields that are less able to be present in rangeland ecosystems.

AB  - Tropical studies traditionally describe insect diversity variation throughout the year. The temporally structured responses of insect assemblages to climate seasonality vary across ecosystems due to gradients of resource availability and limiting ecological factors. These idiosyncratic responses might be particularly true across the vast geographical range of the Brazilian territory, including various environments that harbor one of the most diverse ant faunas worldwide. This study addressed the relationship between ant diversity and climatic seasonality, performing a quantitative review of the published data on ant diversity collected in Brazil. We investigated the seasonality effect on ant abundance and richness described in the literature in 47 papers published between 2000 and 2018. These studies were developed mainly in the Atlantic Forest biome and collected ants with pitfall traps on the soil/litter stratum. We initially carried out a vote-counting procedure by comparing the number of significant results describing seasonal differences in the ant assemblage. We found that most papers described a similar pattern of ant abundance, richness, and species composition between seasons. However, when we performed a meta-analysis, we observed a clear pattern of higher ant abundance and richness in the wet/summer season compared with the dry/winter season. Our meta-analysis reveals that the ant diversity decreases in the dry season, strongly in the Cerrado biome. Additionally, we point out differences in the sampling effort across biomes, indicating the need for further investments in studies focused on temporal diversity patterns, including seasonal effects, on the insect assemblage in biomes less investigated so far.

AB  - The Brazilian state of Acre is located in the southwestern Amazon and it is characterized by a humid tropical forest vegetation that covers plains and mountains. Up to this point, the composition of termite species in the state is not known. The aim of this study was to provide a checklist of termite species or recognizable taxonomic units for the state of Acre. Sampling was conducted through field expeditions at the Serra do Divisor National Park, Chandless State Park, Humaita Forest Reserve, and Chico Mendes Environmental Park using a standardized rapid termite inventory protocol in the first two areas and active searching collections in the others, without a specific protocol. This study also included occurrence records published in the scientific literature. A total of 128 species and morphospecies of termites were found in Acre, distributed across 59 genera and four families. The most frequently occurring species in Acre was Heterotermes tenuis (Hagen, 1858). The study also identified six new species records for Brazil. The predominant feeding groups were soil-feeders and wood-feeders, as expected from data obtained from surveys in humid tropical forests. Despite the significant number of new records for Acre (112), it is concluded that a larger sampling effort is still required, as many areas of the state have not yet been studied for termites.

AB  - Climate change is a fundamental process affecting terrestrial ecosystems. However, there is relatively little knowledge about its impacts on soil communities, with a large degree of uncertainty regarding their resistance to predicted alterations in temperature and, particularly, precipitation. Moreover, most studies exploring the response of soil biota to predicted rainfall reduction have focused on mesic environments and soil microbes, which limit our ability to find general patterns across ecosystems and soil organisms. In this study, we analysed the impact of predicted climate change scenarios of rainfall reduction on soil food webs of Mediterranean waterlimited forests using nematodes as bioindicators. We took advantage of replicated rainfall exclusion infrastructures (30% exclusion) established in Quercus forests of southern Spain in 2016 (2-year exclusion) and of southern France in 2003 (15-year exclusion) to explore the sensitivity of the soil food web to predicted reductions at short- and long-term scales. Rainfall reduction had large negative short-term effects on nematode abundance, particularly of lower trophic groups (bacterivores and fungivores). Rainfall reduction had also consistent shortand long-term impacts on community composition (decrease of fungivores, marginal increase of omnivores) and nematode-based indicators of soil food web structure (higher maturity and structure index, lower prey:predator ratio). These results can be considered indicative of a low resistance of the soil food web to rainfall reductions predicted by climate change. Overall, our findings demonstrate the sensitivity of water-limited forests to further reductions in soil water availability, which might substantially alter their soil communities and likely affect the many ecosystem processes that they control.

AB  - In the time of ongoing climate change and the increasing area of post-mining landscape, the successful afforestation of reclamation sites by suitable adaptive tree species is gaining in importance. One of possible ways may be the use of introduced tree species, which is, however, a controversial topic in relation to risks for forest management and nature conservation. The objective of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the forest stands (age 48 years) of 9 introduced and 3 native coniferous tree species in lowland post-mining coal site of the Czech Republic. The research was focused on production potential, health status, resistance to climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and soil properties. The highest timber production, biomass and carbon stock (49-95% above average), was observed in case of Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra and Pseudotsuga menziesii. On the other hand, unsuitable habitat, insect and pathogens caused poor health status and extremely low production parameters (by 55-62% than average) in Pinus strobus and P. rotundata. In terms of climate, Pinus sylvestris, P. nigra, Larix decidua, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Picea omorika were the most resistance tree species in relation to climatic extremes. Conversely, Pinus rotundata, P. strobus, P. ponderosa, Picea pungens and P. abies were very sensitive to climate events, especially to the lack of precipitation in vegetation period with synergism of high temperature. In terms of soil parameters, the content of plant available nutrients (K, Ca, Mg) was adequate except P deficiency. The highest soil reaction was detected for Pinus nigra and P. sylvestris (pH 6.9-7.1) compared to Picea mariana (pH 4.8). The benefits of "suitable" introduced tree species (Pinus nigra, Pseudotsuga menziesii) are high timber production potential and good adaptation and mitigation of the changing climate; however, native tree species (Pinus sylvestris, Larix decidua) can provide better environmental benefits on reclamation sites.

KW  - National Forest Inventory protocols
KW  - stratified sampling with clusters of plots
AB  - National Forest Inventory (NFI) protocols have traditionally been designed to assess land coverage and the production value of forest. We propose that this approach needs to evolve toward multipurpose resource survey with broader scope, including data on plant and animal biodiversity, forest carbon pools, and carbon sequestration, given the role of forests in addressing climate change. New Guinea hosts the third largest tropical rainforest in the world and is a globally recognized center of biological diversity and endemism. Here, we report on the NFI by the Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG); designed to assess and monitor the country's forests for multiple parameters including timber and nontimber resources, greenhouse gases sequestration and storage, and biodiversity. Stratified sampling with clusters of plots was applied to collect quantitative data on a wide range of variables including soil, tree and nontree species as well as birds and three types of insects: ants, geometrid moths, and fruit flies. In total 43 cluster sites, each with multiple plots were assessed. These partial results, from the projected total of 200 clusters, have demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of the expanded approach to national forest surveys. They contributed to the Biennial Update Report on climate change for PNG and the formation of climate change policies such as the National Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation+ Strategy and the developments of PNG's Forest Reference Level, and the enhanced (second) Nationally Determined Contributions for PNG. They will also inform the biodiversity conservation and forestry policies in the future.

AB  - Forestry is one of the sectors particularly affected by the threats posed by changing climatic conditions. This is reflected in the deterioration of the health status of stands due to the synergistic effect of numerous abiotic and biotic factors. Current forest health problems are due to dynamic, negative changes in the forest environment. While the amount of precipitation remains at a similar level, its distribution varies throughout the year and, in particular, the lack of soil moisture during the growing season leads to the weakening of trees, including the main forest-forming species in Poland such as Pinus sylvestris. The weakening of trees, in turn, leads to species of insect pests that were previously considered secondary becoming primary pests, such as Ips acuminatus. It is likely that weakening of trees also favours increased occurrence of parasitic plants such as Viscum album ssp. austriacum or Loranthus europaeus. Infestations of the hemiparasitic, xylem-secreting pine mistletoe are of great interest because they are spreading rapidly throughout Europe. Drought in forests is not only a long-term water shortage, but also a situation in which plant-fungal relationships are disrupted. Reduced water availability leads to a number of negative changes in the soil and the mycobiota that live there, affecting entire ecosystems. The effects of climate change and increased international trade are leading to the spread of pathogenic fungi and other harmful organisms whose range was previously restricted to the south of our continent. Unfavourable abiotic and biotic factors leading to weakening of oak stands in the western part of Poland have resulted in activation of new pests like Mediterranean oak borer. Intensification of transport and shortening of its duration, as well as climatic changes, favour the introduction of various organisms, including bark beetles (Scolytinae). In Poland, cyclic insect outbreaks are one of the most important problems in forest protection. Developing methods to monitor, prevent outbreaks and control the density of insect populations below harmful levels can be a challenge to consider. Finding an innovative system for applying insecticides to control spruce bark beetle could also be an interesting solution, where insects attracted to pheromones die after contact with the insecticide. Contact with the insecticide has a dual effect: either directly when the tree is treated, or when the bark beetle attempts to invade the tree. Opportunities for the use of biostimulants in forestry and is an attractive way to regenerate plants after negative stressors such as frost, drought or damage caused by improper use of pesticides, as well as the negative effects of diseases and pests. It acts indirectly by stimulating leaf, stem and root development and improving nutrient uptake. The effects of chemical treatments on fungal biodiversity in forests should be studied using powerful molecular tools such as NGS.

AB  - In spite of their small global area and restricted distributions, tropical montane forests (TMFs) are biodiversity hotspots and important ecosystem services providers, but are also highly vulnerable to climate change. To protect and preserve these ecosystems better, it is crucial to inform the design and implementation of conservation policies with the best available scientific evidence, and to identify knowledge gaps and future research needs. We conducted a systematic review and an appraisal of evidence quality to assess the impacts of climate change on TMFs. We identified several skews and shortcomings. Experimental study designs with controls and long-term (>= 10 years) data sets provide the most reliable evidence, but were rare and gave an incomplete understanding of climate change impacts on TMFs. Most studies were based on predictive modelling approaches, short-term (<10 years) and cross-sectional study designs. Although these methods provide moderate to circumstantial evidence, they can advance our understanding on climate change effects. Current evidence suggests that increasing temperatures and rising cloud levels have caused distributional shifts (mainly upslope) of montane biota, leading to alterations in biodiversity and ecological functions. Neotropical TMFs were the best studied, thus the knowledge derived there can serve as a proxy for climate change responses in under-studied regions elsewhere. Most studies focused on vascular plants, birds, amphibians and insects, with other taxonomic groups poorly represented. Most ecological studies were conducted at species or community levels, with a marked paucity of genetic studies, limiting understanding of the adaptive capacity of TMF biota. We thus highlight the long-term need to widen the methodological, thematic and geographical scope of studies on TMFs under climate change to address these uncertainties. In the short term, however, in-depth research in well-studied regions and advances in computer modelling approaches offer the most reliable sources of information for expeditious conservation action for these threatened forests.

AB  - Soil moisture is among the most important factors regulating soil biodiversity and functioning. Models forecast changes in the precipitation regime in many areas of the planet, but how these changes will influence soil functioning, and how biotic drivers modulate such effects, is far from being understood. We evaluated the responses of C and N fluxes, and soil microbial properties to different soil water regimes in soils from the main three ecotypes of the world's largest and most diverse tropical savanna. Further, we explored the direct and indirect effects of changes in the ecotype and soil water regimes on these key soil processes. Soils from the woodland savanna showed a better nutritional status than the other ecotypes, as well as higher potential N cycling rates, N2O emissions, and soil bacterial abundance but lower bacterial richness, whereas potential CO2 emissions and CH4 uptake peaked in the intermediate savanna. The ecotype also modulated the effects of changes in the soil water regime on nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas fluxes, and soil bacterial properties, with more intense responses in the intermediate savanna. Further, we highlight the existence of multiple contrasting direct and indirect (via soil microbes and abiotic properties) effects of an intensification of the precipitation regime on soil C- and N-related processes. Our results confirm that ecotype is a fundamental driver of soil properties and functioning in the Cerrado and that it can determine the responses of key soil processes to changes in the soil water regime.

AB  - The bagana de carnauba is the agroindustrial waste generated after the extraction of the wax from the leaves of the carnauba [Copernicia prunifera (Miller). H. E. Moore] and is widely used as organic fertilizer. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the density, diversity and composition of soil invertebrates as a function of continuous applications of carnauba bagana in a Plintosol. The study was conducted in the dry season of 2018 and in the rainy season of 2019 on two sites fertilized with carnauba bagana for 40 and 5 years with intercropped maize and beans, a site with Fallow land, in addition to a site with Caatinga transitional forest/Cerrado deciduous used as a reference. Soil fauna was collected using pitfall traps placed in the central part of each area, where they remained for seven days. Only in the dry period the Native Forest presented a significantly higher value of average richness. Sites fertilized with carnauba bagana showed a greater number of individuals with 5-years CB showing lower values of the epigean community diversity index. The dominant groups were Aranae, Collembola, Coleoptera, Diptera, Formicidae and Coleoptera larvae in the period of higher humidity and low temperature, with a reduction of Diptera and Coleoptera larvae in the dry season. Sites with carnauba bagana applied to the soil surface about 40 years ago and native forest were associated with several taxonomic groups in the rainy season.

AB  - Deforestation and agricultural expansion in the tropics affect local and regional climatic conditions, leading to synergistic negative impacts on land ecosystems. Climatic changes manifest in increased inter- and intraseasonal variations and frequency of extreme climatic events (i.e., droughts and floods), which have evident consequences for aboveground biodiversity. However, until today, there have been no studies on how land use affects seasonal variations below ground in tropical ecosystems, which may be more buffered against climatic variation. Here, we analyzed seasonal variations in soil parameters, basal respiration, microbial communities, and abundances of soil invertebrates along with microclimatic conditions in rainforest and monocultures of oil palm and rubber in Sumatra, Indonesia. About 75% (20 out of 26) of the measured litter and soil, microbial, and animal parameters varied with season, with seasonal changes in 50% of the parameters depending on land use. Land use affected seasonal variations in microbial indicators associated with carbon availability and cycling rate. The magnitude of seasonal variations in microbial parameters in the soil of monocultures was almost 40% higher than in the soil of rainforest. Measured parameters were associated with short-term climatic conditions (3-day period air humidity) in plantations, but not in rainforest, confirming a reduced soil buffering ability in plantations. Overall, our findings suggest that land use temporally shifts and increases the magnitude of seasonal variations of the belowground ecosystem compartment, with microbial communities responding most strongly. The increased seasonal variations in soil biota in plantations likely translate into more pronounced fluctuations in essential ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration, and these ramifications ultimately may compromise the stability of tropical ecosystems in the long term. As the observed seasonal dynamics is likely to increase with both local and global climate change, these shifts need closer attention for the long-term sustainable management of plantation systems in the tropics.

AB  - The research was carried out in the coniferous-deciduous forests of the northwestern Caucasus, growing in similar climatic and soil-orographic conditions. Three types of forests of different ages were studied: aspen-hornbeam (50-70 years), beech-firhornbeam (80-110 years) and fir-beech forests (over 450 years). The studies were performed on the territory Krasnodar Krai (upper reaches of the Pshekha river, State Nature Reserve Chernogor'e) and the Republic of Adygea (upper reaches of the Belaya river, the Caucasian State Biosphere Reserve) in the summer seasons 2016 and 2019. The research involves geobotanical, population-ontogenetic, and soil-zoological methods. It has been established that in the canopy gaps of all forest types species density of plants is almost twice as high as in under-crown areas or even higher due to good light factor and high soil moisture since the tree stand does not intercept precipitation. Regeneration of tree cenopopulations in all forest types is much more effective in canopy gaps compared to under-crown areas. The undergrowth density of different types of trees is 10 and more times higher in gaps than in the under-crown areas. The maximum number of ecological-coenotic groups of plants is observed in the canopy gaps in all types of forest. All major trophic groups of macrofauna inhabit canopy gaps and under-crown areas, but their biomass in gaps is significantly exceeds that in under-crown areas. Due to the fact that soil moisture supply is an essential factor for moisture-loving saprophages' activity, biomass of saprophages is on average twice as high in gaps than under-crown areas of all forest types. Only canopy gaps have high biomass of anecic earthworms - there are important ecosystem engineers, which contribute a lot to plant litter processing and the formation of soil porosity.

AB  - Natural habitat plays a role in many agroecosystems as a source of pollination services and other ecological spillover, but these effects are largely unquantified in oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), a globally important crop linked to deforestation. In a field experiment in Sumatra, Indonesia, we manipulated floral visitor access to female oil palm inflorescences over a 100 m distance gradient from forest into oil palm and sampled insects with sticky traps placed above male and female inflorescences. Full exclusion of floral visitors decreased mean oil palm fruit set to 12%, demonstrating that insect pollination was necessary to maintain favorable fruit set and yield. Treatment group means of fruit set under open pollination (62%) and when excluding large (>1.4 mm diameter) organisms (72%), did not differ significantly from open pollination augmented with hand pollination (61%), suggesting no difference in pollen limitation. In contrast, when we examined change in fruit set with distance from forest, we found a significant trend of higher fruit set in oil palms closer to the forest when large organisms were excluded, which increased estimated fruit set at the forest edge to 87%, compared to open-pollinated palms (70%). This trend with distance from forest was absent when we fully excluded floral visitors, showing that the effect of forest was not likely due to an abiotic gradient (e.g., changing soil nutrients). Of the arthropod taxa collected from sticky traps, Drosophilidae (Diptera) and Gelechiidae (Lepidoptera) decreased and increased with distance from forest, respectively. The taxa Elaeidobius kamerunicus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), Gelechiidae, and the families Thripidae and Phlaeothripidae (Thysanoptera) were abundant on both male and female inflorescence sticky traps. Elaeidobius kamerunicus, an introduced oil palm pollinator, had the only significant relationship with fruit set. Our results confirm pollination by insects as a key ecosystem service for oil palm production. Although further work is needed to clarify the relationship between fruit set, biodiversity, and distance from forest, we speculate that excluding large organisms could have increased fruit set closer to forest by mediating interactions between pollinators, forest predators, and farm mesopredators. Understanding the relationships between nearby forest and pollination services could better connect oil palm production to its landscape context and associated biodiversity. This would be important for landscape-scale conservation planning that considers both the ecosystem service needs and ecological impacts of oil palm agriculture.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that drive the change of biotic assemblages over space and time is the main quest of community ecology. Assessing the relative importance of dispersal and environmental species selection in a range of organismic sizes and motilities has been a fruitful strategy. A consensus for whether spatial and environmental distances operate similarly across spatial scales and taxa, however, has yet to emerge. We used censuses of four major groups of organisms (soil bacteria, fungi, ground insects, and trees) at two observation scales (1-m(2) sampling point vs. 2,500-m(2) plots) in a topographically standardized sampling design replicated in two tropical rainforests with contrasting relationships between spatial distance and nutrient availability. We modeled the decay of assemblage similarity for each taxon set and site to assess the relative contributions of spatial distance and nutrient availability distance. Then, we evaluated the potentially structuring effect of tree composition over all other taxa. The similarity of nutrient content in the litter and topsoil had a stronger and more consistent selective effect than did dispersal limitation, particularly for bacteria, fungi, and trees at the plot level. Ground insects, the only group assessed with the capacity of active dispersal, had the highest species turnover and the flattest nonsignificant distance-decay relationship, suggesting that neither dispersal limitation nor nutrient availability were fundamental drivers of their community assembly at this scale of analysis. Only the fungal communities at one of our study sites were clearly coordinated with tree composition. The spatial distance at the smallest scale was more important than nutrient selection for the bacteria, fungi, and insects. The lower initial similarity and the moderate variation in composition identified by these distance-decay models, however, suggested that the effects of stochastic sampling were important at this smaller spatial scale. Our results highlight the importance of nutrients as one of the main environmental drivers of rainforest communities irrespective of organismic or propagule size and how the overriding effect of the analytical scale influences the interpretation, leading to the perception of greater importance of dispersal limitation and ecological drift over selection associated with environmental niches at decreasing observation scales.

AB  - The growing global need for latex is driving rubber plantation (RP) expansion since the last century, with >2 Mha of cultivation area being established in the last decade. Southeast Asia is the hotspot for rubber cultivation at other land-use costs. Although rubber cultivation has improved the economic status of farmers, it has altered the habitat's ecology and ecosystem functions (EF). However, studies on the impacts of RP on EF are limited, and a clear overview is not available. To bridge this gap, we conducted an inclusive review of the EF of RP, includ-ing soil carbon storage, aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB), litter production and de-composition, respiration, and biodiversity (plants, animals, soil fauna, and microbes). We compared the EF in RP (monoculture) with those in forests because the conversion of forests to RP is prevalent in the tropics and be-cause most RP studies used forests as reference ecosystems. We found RP generally have lower EF than forests. The impacts of RP on some EF are more severe (e.g., AGB, BGB, and plant diversity), causing decreases of >55%, and the effects are consistently negative irrespective of plantation age. However, including agroforestry or polyculture, integrated pest management, cover cropping, mulching, and composting can improve the EF in RP to some extent. We highlighted research gaps, particularly substantial research gaps concerning the influence of plant diversity treatments (i.e., agroforestry) performed in RP on EF. Additionally, more empirical data on the significance of spatial and temporal levels are required, such as how the impact on EF could vary with climate and RP age, as we showed some examples where EF differs spatially and temporally. More importantly, further research on plantation management to offset EF losses is needed. Finally, we emphasized knowledge gaps and suggested future directions and policies for improving EF in RP.

AB  - Understanding shrub effects on plant litter arthropod community structure in contrasting semiarid and arid grassland ecosystems could lead to the promotion of biodiversity conservation and sustainable management in afforested plantations. An investigation of litter arthropod abundance and diversity beneath the shrub canopy and in open spaces between shrubs was conducted via a litterbag field experiment during two consecutive years in a semiarid and an arid grassland ecosystem. Litter arthropod diversity and abundance were significantly higher in the shrub understory than in open spaces in the arid grassland. Furthermore, a similar abundance of both total mites and predatory mites was found in the shrub understory. However contrasting trends were found in the semiarid grassland. Significantly higher detritivorous mite abundance was found in the open areas between shrubs with no clear facilitation effects on the detritivore community. In conclusion, shrub facilitation could expand biodiversity conservation towards open spaces in extreme arid grasslands. The increasing drought expected for the region under climate change scenarios strengthens the importance of conserving shrub cover in these ecosystems to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Species loss leads to changes in ecosystem function and services, impacting human well-being. Although biodiversity restoration is pivotal to circumvent this situation, the techniques for restoring old-growth savannas are still limited and the restoration outcomes remain unpredictable. Here, we use a trait-based approach to understand the functional outcomes of ecological restoration via direct seeding in a Brazilian savanna (cerrado, hereafter neotropical savanna). We compared the functional composition from woody and non-woody component, total biomass, and biomass allocation of a restored relative to a degraded savanna (abandoned pasture) dominated by exotic grasses and a well-preserved old-growth native savanna. We found that the functional composition of restored communities was very similar to those dominated by exotic grasses, both characterized by a greater dominance of species with acquisitive traits, higher above-ground biomass, and lower investment in root biomass. In contrast, the native vegetation exhibited a dominance of conservative traits and higher investment in belowground rather than aboveground biomass. Even though the acquisitive traits in the restored savanna allow a fast aboveground biomass accumulation and soil cover, the lower belowground biomass investment in the restored savanna may limit its resistance and resilience to droughts and fires. Our findings suggest that restoration efforts in neotropical savanna should focus on fostering the establishment of slow-growing species to recover the ecosystem properties provided by the high biodiversity in neotropical savannas.

AB  - Soil fauna is vitally important to all soil ecosystems due to its significant role in humification and mineralization of plant residues, cycling of nutrients, improvement of soil porosity and structure, etc. Soil fauna is sensitive to land-use changes, fertilizer use, tillage, and land degradation. Tea production is one of the most important agricultural industries in China. However, very few studies have investigated the responses of soil fauna to tea tree (Camellia sinensis L.) cultivars; understanding these responses is crucial to maintaining soil health and biological diversity stability in such agricultural ecosystems. This paper concentrates on the impacts of tea trees on soil faunal community composition and diversity, forming the background of an evaluation of the land-use sustainability associated with various cultivars. Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0-20 cm from four major tea plantations in western Sichuan, China, with different cultivars ("Chuannong Huangyazao" - CH, "Riding Dabai" - FD; "Chuanmu No.217"- CM, and "Chuancha No.3" - CC). The results showed that different tea tree cultivars in this study had significant (p < 0.05) influences on soil chemical properties. The soil at the FD plantation had the lowest pH, total nitrogen (TN), and available phosphorus (AP) but the highest available nitrogen (AN), while the soil at the CM plantation had the highest pH, AP and available potassium (AK). The highest soil faunal abundance (as indicated by the number of individuals per unit area) and community diversity (as indicated by Shannon and Margalef indices) occurred at the CC plantation. This result illustrated that compared to the other plantations, the CC plantation provided a more habitable environment and more nutrient resources for the soil faunal community development. The diversity of the soil faunal community was highly associated (p < 0.05) with variations in soil pH, organic carbon (OC), TN, AP and AK. The effects of tea tree cultivars on the rare soil faunal composition differed among the four tea plantations, but no significant difference in the composition of dominant and common taxa was observed. The relative abundance of the top ten soil faunal taxa was strongly associated with environmental variables. The two most important environmental factors (AP and AN) accounted for 57 % of the changes in soil faunal composition. This study highlighted cultivation and land-use management practices to promote soil health sustainability and soil faunal stability on land degraded by tea tree cultivars in western Sichuan, China.

AB  - Altitudinal changes in the diversity of plants and animals have been well documented; however, soil animals received little attention in this context and it is unclear whether their diversity follows general altitudinal distribution patterns. Changbai Mountain is one of few well-conserved mountain regions comprising natural ecosystems on the Eurasian continent. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the diversity and community composition of Collembola along ten altitudinal sites representing five vegetation types from forest to alpine tundra. Among 7834 Collembola individuals, 84 morphospecies were identified. Species richness varied marginally significant with altitude and generally followed a unimodal relationship with altitude. By contrast, the density of Collembola did not change in a consistent way with altitude. Collembola communities changed gradually with altitude, with local habitat-related factors (soil and litter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, litter carbon content, and soil pH) and climatic variables (precipitation seasonality) identified as major drivers of changes in Collembola community composition. Notably, local habitat-related factors explained more variation in Collembola assemblages than climatic variables. The results suggest that local habitat-related factors including precipitation and temperature are the main drivers of changes in Collembola communities with altitude. Specifically, soil and litter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio correlated positively with Collembola communities at high altitudes, whereas soil pH correlated positively at low altitudes. This documents that altitudinal gradients provide unique opportunities for identifying factors driving the community composition of not only above- but also belowground invertebrates.

Litter, soil chemical attributes, and soil fauna can be used for this purpose since these factors are linked to each other in nutrient cycling and respond to changes in land use management. The present study aimed to identify accumulated litter biomass on topsoil, its nutrient concentration, composition of the epigeal fauna community, and topsoil chemical attributes as possible soil quality indicators in restoration areas of Atlantic Forest (T1, T2, and T3) with different levels of native tree seedlings richness (29, 58, and 114 species, respectively), pasture (T4), and native forest (T5, control), by three plots (50 x 50 m) in each area, in the municipality of Linhares, Espirito Santo, Brazil. Samples of accumulated litter on topsoil, topsoil (0-5 cm), and community of epigeal fauna (by pitfall traps) were collected during the dry and rainy seasons. Accumulated litter biomass on the topsoil, concentration of K and Mg in its biomass, abundance of Coleoptera and Pseudoscorpionida, total N and exchangeable K concentrations in the topsoil were the most relevant soil quality indicators, according to the principal component analysis. In both climatic seasons, T5 presented high dissimilarity in relation to the other areas and best soil quality due to its association to higher values of accumulated litter biomass, its nutrient concentration (N, K, Ca, Mg, S), relative frequency or abundance of Coleoptera, Pseudoscorpionida, and Others, concentrations of total organic carbon, total N, available P, exchangeable Ca, extractable acidity, sum of bases, and cation exchange capacity; T1, T2, and T3 were associated to higher values of relative frequency of Formicidae and presented low dissimilarity to each other; T4 was associated to higher values of pH. Therefore, the forest restoration areas have not yet contributed to the general quality of the soil approaching that observed in T5.

AB  - IntroductionTropical forests harbor a large diversity of closely related tree species that can thrive across habitats. This biodiversity has been found to correspond to large functional diversity in aboveground traits, and likely also relates to belowground trait variation. Globally, root trait (co-)variation is driven by different belowground resource strategies of species, environmental variation, and phylogeny; however, these patterns mostly reflect observations from temperate biomes and remain unconfirmed in tropical trees. We examine phylogenetic and environmental effects on root trait (co-)variation of trees across habitats in an Amazonian rainforest. MethodsRoots of 218 tree species from ten dominant families were sampled across three major habitats near Manaus, Brazil. We quantified five morphological and architectural root traits to (i) investigate how they reflected different resource strategies across species, (ii) compare them between families and superorders to test phylogenetic effects, and (iii) compare them between habitats to determine environmental effects on root trait expressions and variability. ResultsRoot traits discriminated species along a tradeoff between root diameter and root branching and, secondly, due to variation in root tissue density. Our results further show weak phylogenetic effects on tropical tree root variation, for example, families from the same superorder showed large divergence in their root traits, while those from different superorders often overlapped in their root morphology and architecture. Root traits differed significantly between habitats but habitat type had only little effect on overall root trait variation. DiscussionOur work suggests that the dimensions and drivers that underlie (co-)variation in tropical root traits may differ from global patterns defined by mostly temperate datasets. Due to (a)biotic environmental differences, different root trait dimensions may underlie the belowground functional diversity in (Neo)tropical forests, and we found little evidence for the strong phylogenetic conservatism observed in root traits in temperate biomes. We highlight important avenues for future research on tropical roots in order to determine the degree of, and shifts in functional diversity belowground as communities and environments change in tropical forests.

AB  - Agricultural intensification that results in conversion of forests into crop fields affects soil biodiversity including nematodes which contribute to ecosystem services and play a key role in maintenance of soil health. The nematode soil food web and metabolic footprints of a tropical forest and surrounding tea fields in Embu, Kenya were investigated. Soil samples were collected from tea fields and forest and the nematodes were identified to the genus level. The plant-parasitic index in the tea fields was high and the abundance of nematodes in cp2 class and Ba-2 functional guild were greater than those in the forest. Helicotylenchus, Rotylenchus, Telotylenchus and Mal-enchus occurred in higher densities in the forest which also had a significantly high predator footprint. The pH, Mn, sand, clay and silt content varied across the forest and tea fields. Nematode communities in the two land use systems were distinct based on non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ordinations. Heterocephalobus which was positively correlated to pH and Helicotylenchus, Telotylenchus, lotonchus and Rotylenchus which had a negative association with silt contributed to the dissimilarity observed in the forest and tea fields. The findings provide an insight into the effects of land use change on nematode communities in the two systems. This study will provide baseline data that can be used to make informed decisions on tea production and land use strategies that enhance soil health.

AB  - Key message We identified the effect of microclimatic conditions on soil mite communities (Mesostigmata) during the decomposition of broadleaved and coniferous litter. The abundance, species richness, and diversity of mite communities decreased from spring to autumn regardless of litter quality and was related to changes in temperature and precipitation. Context Litter decomposition is one of the fundamental soil-supporting processes in terrestrial ecosystems. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on some general patterns of the relationships between litter quality (tree species), microclimate, and structure of soil mite assemblages. Aims The study aimed to analyze the impact of climatic conditions (temperature and precipitation) on mesostigmatid mite communities in the litter of 11 tree species through the vegetation season. Methods The experiment tested litter decomposition of 11 different tree species (693 litterbags), for seven consecutive months (April-October) under homogenous Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) canopy monocultures in common garden conditions. Soil mites were extracted in Tullgren funnels. Results Mesostigmatid mite abundance was positively correlated with the temperature of the sampling month and negatively with the temperature of the previous month. Species richness depended on the sampling month temperature. Changes in litter mass loss in late autumn (after litterfall) and overwinter were important for colonization of litterbags by soil mesostigmatid mites in the following spring. Conclusions Changes in climatic conditions, i.e., temperature and precipitation between the sampling months (during the following vegetation period), may cause significant changes in mesostigmatid mite abundance and thus may impact ecosystem functions. The winter period is important for mesostigmatid mite abundance in the following vegetation period.

AB  - Introduction: The Tephritoidea as a group, have an ecological impact because they feed on fungi, insects, flow-ers, decaying fruit, excrement, sweat, root nodules, carrion (including human corpses), and other decomposing materials. The fruit-flies are insects of great importance in agriculture and genetic research. In Colombia, there are 58 genera and 224 species, but there is no general study of the group in the savannas of Orinoquia. Objective: To characterize the Tephritoidea communities (taxonomic and ecological aspects) and to provide basic information about the economically important species in the Colombian Orinoquia. Methods: Weekly from August 2017 to February 2018 we collected flies from fruits and McPhail traps baited with corn protein, in a domestic orchard and a forest fragment in Arauca, and also in Saravena, Orinoquia, Colombia. Results: We identified 27 species (12 Tephritidae, 11 Richardiidae and 4 Lonchaeidae), nine of them agricultural pests. Euarestopsis paupera, Hemixantha lutea, Melanoloma affinis, Melanoloma cyanogaster, Melanoloma varians and Sepsisoma anale are reported for the first time from Colombia. A diversity index was calculated for studied communities, being differences between localities and sites. Influence of climatic conditions over variability was found and is discussed. Nine species of fruit flies, which are considered agricultural pests, were identified. For these species their relationship with host plants and population dynamics were studied. Conclusions: Six months of sampling produced several first reports, suggesting that the fauna of Tephritoidea is undersampled in the region. The rainy season, and human activities, correlate with species diversity and abundance in the Colombian Orinoquia.

AB  - The continued decline in both populations and diversity of soil macrofauna in agroecosystems remains a major concern for sustainable food production in Southern Africa. Macrofauna abundance and diversity were examined in a maize monocropping system following repeated incorporation of Calliandra calothyrsus, Crotalaria juncea, cattle manure, maize stover, and Pinus patula sawdust at 1.2 or 4.0 t C ha(-1) with or without nitrogen (120 kg N ha(-1)) for 13 years (seasons). All treatments received phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and sulphur (S) at 16.0, 14.7 and 4.6 kg ha(-1), respectively, at each planting time in December. Using the ISO/TSBF (Tropical Soils Biology and Fertility Institute) monoliths procedure, macrofauna were collected to a depth of 0.30 m fortnightly from February to mid-May 2016. Lumbricus terrestris and Isoptera were significantly (P < 0.001) affected by organic treatment and seasonal time, while organic treatment alone significantly affected Elateridae. A fluctuating trend characterised Diplopoda, L. terrestris and Isoptera with two general peaks for L. terrestris and a significant Isoptera peak under maize stover. Rainfall significantly influenced L. terrestris and Isoptera abundance, while within-season sampling time explained the observed fluctuations in Diplopoda, Holotrichia serrata, Araneae, Acrididae, and Formicidae. While Araneae was prevalent under maize stover, Elateridae, H. serrata and Araneae showed no distinct pattern in abundance. At low application rate, higher Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were apparent except for maize stover. Increasing application rate of the different organics amplified stimulation, abundance and persistence of macrofauna, and significantly increased diversity relative to the control. Application of N-based mineral fertiliser appeared to be detrimental to selective macrofauna (e.g., L. terrestris, Isoptera and Elateridae). Monte Carlo permutation test identified ammonium nitrate as the most influential and detrimental variable followed by organic resource quality, soil organic carbon (SOC) and application rate. Long-term co-application of organic and inorganic resources thus stimulated macrofaunal populations and maintained diversity. To sustain the productivity of the predominantly maize-based smallholder cropping systems, it is proposed that extension packages promote the inclusion of a minimum of at least 1.2 t carbon ha(-1) annually towards improved soil health.

AB  - Forests are important for biodiversity, timber production and carbon accumulation, but these ecosystem services may be impacted by climate change. Field data collected from individual forest types occurring across a climatic gradient can contribute to forecasting these consequences. We examined how changes in temperature, precipitation and aridity affect ecosystem services in 23 mature Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests in nine climatic regions across a 900 km gradient in British Columbia, Canada. Using Canadian National Forest Inventory methodology, we assessed richness and diversity of plant functional groups, site index, and above- and below-ground carbon stocks. As aridity increased, ecosystem-level tree species richness declined on average from four to one species, Douglas-fir site index declined from 30 to 15 m, and ecosystem carbon storage decreased from 565 to 222 Mg ha(-1). Tree species richness was positively and herb species richness negatively correlated with carbon storage. Carbon storage by ecosystem compartment was largest in aboveground live tree biomass, declining in the following order: mineral soils > coarse woody debris and dead standing trees > forest floor > small and fine woody debris > understory plants. Mineral soil carbon at depths of 0-15 cm, 15-35 cm, and 35-55 cm increased with increasing mean annual precipitation and decreasing aridity. Our results indicate that as aridity increases and precipitation decreases, tree species richness, site index and carbon storage in existing Douglas-fir forests declines. However, assisted or natural migration of Douglas-fir into more humid regions could be associated with more diverse, productive, carbon-rich forests. This study informs carbon stock vulnerability and provides empirical data essential for carbon stock forecasts.

AB  - In summer 2018, Central Europe was hit by an extreme drought event that widely impacted ecosystems and markedly increased tree mortality in forest ecosystems across the continent. As climate models predict an increase in frequency and severity of such events, there is an urgent need to adapt forests in order to maintain the diverse benefits they provide. Soil processes play an essential role in this context and are key for a plethora of terrestrial ecosystem functions, but they are strongly dependent on water availability. Here, we investigated how tree species richness (TSR), composition, and identity in a 13-year-old temperate tree diversity experiment influenced selected ecosystem functions (as important representatives of different ecosystem processes) during the 2018 summer drought. We focused on the stability of soil microbial biomass and standard litter decomposition, as well as tree species-specific mortality rates. Contrary to our expectations, TSR did not generally increase the resistance of soil functions or decrease tree mortality rates. However, the resistance of these functions was determined by tree species identity and community composition. For the resistance of both soil functions (microbial biomass and litter decomposition), we found that TSR effects depended on the presence of certain tree species. Moreover, we found that the performance of a specific tree species in monoculture, Norway spruce, was a poor predictor of its response to drought in tree species mixtures. Taken together, the results of our study demonstrate that the species composition of tree stands determines tree mortality and the resistance of soil functions under drought. This indicates that enhancing multiple ecosystem functions under environmental disturbance requires maintaining diverse forests.

AB  - Despite the importance of earthworms for soil formation, more is needed to know about how Pre-Columbian modifi-cations to soils and the landscape. Gaining a deeper understanding is essential for comprehending the historical drivers of earthworm communities and the development of effective conservation strategies in the Amazon rainforest. Human disturbance can significantly impact earthworm diversity, especially in rainforest soils, and in the particular case of the Amazonian rainforest, both recent and ancient anthropic practices may be important. Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are fertile soils found throughout the Amazon Basin, created by sedentary habits and intensification patterns of pre -Colombian societies primarily developed in the second part of the Holocene period. We have sampled earthworm com-munities in three Brazilian Amazonian (ADEs) and adjacent reference soils (REF) under old and young forests and monocultures.To better assess taxonomic richness, we used morphology and the barcode region of the COI gene to identify juveniles and cocoons and delimit Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs). Here we suggest using Integrated Opera-tional Taxonomical units (IOTUs) which combine both morphological and molecular data and provide a more compre-hensive assessment of diversity, while MOTUs only rely on molecular data. A total of 970 individuals were collected, resulting in 51 taxonomic units (IOTUs, MOTUs, and morphospecies combined). From this total, 24 taxonomic units were unique to REF soils, 17 to ADEs, and ten were shared between both soils. The highest richness was found in old forest sites for ADEs (12 taxonomic units) and REFs (21 taxonomic units). The beta-diversity calculations reveal a high species turnover between ADEs and REF soils, providing evidence that ADEs and REFs possess distinct soil biota. Furthermore, results suggest that ADE sites, formed by Pre-Columbian human activities, conserve a high number of native species in the landscape and maintain a high abundance, despite their long-term nature.

AB  - Insects perform many ecosystem functions, yet their responses to disturbance can be unpredictable. Changes in climate may interact with land use disturbances, and given that arthropod species diversity, abundance, and traits within assemblages vary with habitat structure and climatic variables, ecological function may be impaired. Here, we assessed how dung beetle species richness, abundance, functional diversity, mean body size and body size inequality (which can signal assemblage stress responses) varied with climatic, management and habitat variables on livestock farms and protected areas across a rainfall gradient (138-381 mm/year) in arid/semi-arid shrubland (Karoo, South Africa, an area for which entomological biodiversity is relatively poorly known), during a prolonged drought. Species richness was similar between farms and protected areas, but abundance was greater in protected areas. Farms tend to be dominated by sheep in this region, and the type of dung and paucity of dung diversity, along with use of anthelmintics may explain this reduced abundance. Species richness and abundance increased with mammalian herbivore stocking rates and rainfall. Most recent rainfall best predicted species richness, but abundance was best explained by the long-term measure of rainfall (Mean Annual Precipitation). Functional diversity showed no patterns with the environmental or management variables we measured. Mean body length and size variation did not differ between protected areas and farms, but the spread of beetle sizes was more even as vegetation cover increased and soil clay content decreased. Future climate projections indicate extreme declines in rainfall in this area, and our results suggest that this would dramatically impact dung beetle communities. Maintaining vegetation cover may help mitigate effects of climate change.

AB  - Our study was conducted in the suburban forest of Thessaloniki (Seich Sou), which constitutes one of the most significant suburban forests of Greece and is located northeast of Thessaloniki. In 1997, more than the half of the forest area was destroyed by a wildfire, while recently (May 2019), a significant insect outbreak by the bark beetle Tomicus piniperda was detected. The insect action still goes on, while the infestation has destroyed so far more than 300 ha of forest area. Extensive selective logging and removal of infected trees from the forest were carried out in order to mitigate and restrict the outbreak spread. In the current study, silt-fenced erosion plots were installed on representative locations of disturbed (by fire and insect action) and undisturbed areas, in order to quantify the effect of the above-mentioned forest disturbances on soil erosion and correlate the height and intensity of precipitation with the soil erosion rate. The results show that there was no statistically significant increase in soil erosion in the areas of insect outbreak compared with the control plots. However, there was a statistically significant increase in soil erosion in areas where logging works had been applied as an infestation preventive measure. In addition, the study revealed that 25 years after the forest fire, the erosion rate is still at higher level compared with the undisturbed forest areas. This study could be considered as one of the first attempts to evaluate the impact of an insect outbreak infestation on soil erosion, while there is also a great lack of information concerning the assessment of long-term post-fire effects on the soil erosion of a forest ecosystem.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewBiodiversity is one of the most important features of forest ecosystems. One of the goals of Sustainable Forest Management is to reduce biodiversity disturbance, which can occur as a consequence of timber harvesting. The aim of this review was to define which silvicultural systems and forest operations can have an influence on forest tree biodiversity by summarising the findings of nearly 60 papers published in the last ten years (2013-2022).Recent FindingsIn natural forest ecosystems characterised by a high level of structural complexity, such as uneven-aged tropical forests, selective logging and retention forestry are, in general, suitable forms of intervention that have a limited impact on tree biodiversity. Forest operations, in particular, should be of low intensity and try to simulate as much as possible small-scale natural disturbances. Thinning has proved to be a valid treatment for managing tree biodiversity. However, it is important to shape the magnitude of thinnings according to the management aims. Limited removal is recommended in interventions for maintaining the current structure, and more extensive removal is appropriate in cases when a change in species composition is expected, e.g. in the conversion of planted coniferous stands to uneven-aged mixed or broadleaved stands. In addition, coppicing is suitable for maintaining tree biodiversity due to its effectiveness in fostering the presence of light-demanding tree species. Findings show that it is important to establish the right rotation age, considering that an excessively short period between coppicing interventions can be detrimental to functional biodiversity.Skid trails and landing sites represent suitable areas for the initial establishment of natural regeneration. However, generally, the level of biodiversity on these sites declines with time as a consequence of soil compaction, thus highlighting the importance of the forest infrastructure network planning.In uneven-aged tropical forests, selective logging and retention forestry are the most suitable options for maintaining tree biodiversity. Thinning and coppicing help to manage biodiversity, whilst intensive thinning helps to change species composition. Skid trails and landing sites can support natural regeneration. Recommendations and management options were developed, as well as possible future research directions. The authors recommend that future studies should investigate how much tree biodiversity depends on different levels of harvesting technology applied within the same silvicultural treatment.

AB  - Forest decline and dieback are growing phenomena worldwide, resulting in severe, large-scale degradation of the canopy. This can profoundly alter the provision of trophic resources and microhabitats for canopy-dwelling arthropods.In 2019, we assessed the effect of oak decline on the community of canopy-dwelling Hymenoptera. We selected 21 oak stands and 42 plots, located in three forests in France, presenting contrasting levels of decline. Insects were sampled at the canopy level with green multi-funnel and flight-interception traps.We collected a particularly diverse community of 19,289 insect individuals belonging to 918 taxa, 10 larval trophic guilds and 7 nesting guilds.Oak decline had no effect on the abundance or richness of the overall community but significantly reshaped the community assemblages. Decline had contrasting effects depending on the taxa and guilds considered. Specialist parasitoids were more abundant at intermediate levels of decline severity while generalists were negatively affected. Taxa depending on ground-related resources and microhabitats were promoted. Saproxylic taxa were more abundant while xylophagous insects were negatively impacted.Reduced leaf area index promoted several guilds and the diversity of the overall community. While an increasing tree mortality rate enhanced the abundance and diversity of deadwood resources, it had negative impacts on several Hymenoptera guilds. Our results suggest that micro-environmental changes at the ground level due to canopy decline have major cascading effects on the communities of canopy-dwelling Hymenoptera.Our study highlights the relevance of studying Hymenoptera communities to investigate the outcomes of disturbances on forest biodiversity.
   Hymenoptera dwelling in oak canopies are hyper-diverse.Forest decline reshapes the community of canopy-dwelling Hymenoptera, and trophic and nesting guilds have contrasting responses to decline.Species relying on ground-related resources (floral responses and soil microhabitats) are promoted by decline-induced canopy openness.image

AB  - Shell mounds, or middens, are artificial accumulations of food remains such as shells, sediments, artefacts and remains from daily life and funerary rituals, which were deposited in our study area by groups of Sambaquian fisher-hunter-gatherers. These mounds contain remains, which are representative of the fauna and flora at the time they were formed, enabling the recovery of palaeoenvironmental data related to biodiversity of taxa and biogeography, C-14 dating and analysis of changes in the patterns of marine biodiversity and ocean circulation. This paper uses the Casa de Pedra shell mound rock shelter, located in Sao Francisco do Sul, state of Santa Catarina, southeastern Brazil, to study aspects of the palaeoenvironment through analyses of the archaeological material of the site, which contains well-preserved phytoliths and sponge spicules. Among the phytoliths, those from grasses predominate and some trees and palms were present, with no variation in vegetation type during the period of site occupation, between 5,470 and 4,460 years BP. Despite the general stability of the vegetation, a small increase in the density of the tree cover was identified from the base to the top, which may be related to an increase in precipitation, and is in agreement with other palaeoenvironmental studies carried out in southern Brazil.

AB  - Insect pollination improves the yield of most crop species and contributes to one-third of global crop production. The importance of this ecosystem service in improving agricultural production has largely been overlooked, however, in favour of practices that improve soil conditions such as fertiliser use and supplementary irrigation. Using economic modelling, this study estimates the value of insect pollination under different land-use types in Kenya. Our model assumes that a combination of land-use type and the foraging distance of insect pollinators influences the intensity of pollination and the value of agricultural output. To demonstrate the hypothesised relationships, areas under different land-use types, e.g. forest, grassland and cropland, and their distances from households were used as proxies for insect pollination. Concentric buffer zones representing foraging distances of pollinators from the land-use types were drawn at 250 m, 500 m, 1 000 m, 2 000 m and 3 000 m from the farms, and areas under each land use in the buffer zones were estimated for the years 2004, 2007 and 2010. Using the random-effects model and an output distance-function stochastic frontier model, the land-use areas, other factors of production and climate variables were regressed on the value of agricultural output in each buffer zone to determine their contribution to agricultural output resulting from insect pollination. The results indicate higher crop productivity on farms bordering forests and grasslands. This implies that insect pollinators are important for crop production, and increasing the number of pollinator habitats closer to the farms will increase food production in the tropics.

AB  - Relationships between certain plant species and soil fauna assemblages in severe climatic conditions require scientific attention due to reported climatic changes. We investigated density, diversity, and community structure of soil mites (Mesostigmata) in tree biogroups of Betula pendula, Picea abies, and Pinus sylvestris with microhabitats represented by Calluna vulgaris, Dicranum scoparium, Vaccinium myrtillus, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea plant patches and accumulated litter in humid and cold rock crevices a few meters deep. We analyzed the effects of climatic (light availability, precipitation, temperature) and environmental (litter pH, organic matter thickness, microhabitat type) conditions on mite communities based on 1080 samples collected during two vegetation periods (2004-2005). Results revealed that litter pH was shaped by microhabitat type (plant patches and rock crevices) whereas organic matter thickness depended on tree species and microhabitat type. Also, light availability differed between tree biogroups and microhabitats. This study documented that Mesostigmata abundance was shaped by maximum daily temperature while species richness was also affected by total monthly precipitation, tree species (P. sylvestris) and microhabitat (rock crevices). Results revealed that mite density ranged from 3001 +/- 213 ind./m(2) in the P. abies biogroup to 3310 +/- 350 ind./m(2) in P. sylvestris. On the microhabitat level, mite density ranged from 2571 +/- 170 ind./m(2) in V. myrtillus patches to 4137 +/- 463 ind./m(2) in rock crevices. Total number of recorded species was highest in rock crevices (41 species), and lowest in C. vulgaris (19). In conclusion, results indicated that climatic conditions modulate mite communities on an isolated rocky island. This study documented that maximum daily temperature during the vegetation period affected Mesostigmata abundance, whereas species richness and diversity were also shaped by total monthly precipitation and tree species (P. sylvestris). In addition, the community was also affected by litter acidity, organic matter and tree species.

AB  - Soil Arthropods are a vitally important component of the ecosystem, as their diversity, abundance, and distribution pattern play a vital role in ecosystem sustainability. Their population is expected to vary according to geographical patterns and environmental variables such as temperature, and humidity. For this purpose, we collected soil arthropods from the two regions having different latitudinal patterns: FSD (Faisalabad) and MGRH (Muzaffargarh). The soil faunal samples were collected fortnightly from the mango orchards for two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018. During the whole research, a total of 8301 specimens of (16, 11) orders, (118, 57) species, and (5027, 3274) individuals were recorded from FSD and MGRH, respectively. Order Coleoptera found the maximum abundance in both regions among all orders. Our results showed that the FSD regions had a high abundance of arthropods compared to the MGRH region. In comparison, the different diversity factors and abundance revealed a strong correlation with the abiotic factors. They showed a high pattern of distribution and richness at the FSD region, as low temperature and high humidity were observed in the FSD region that influences the more diversity occurrence of fauna. Our results predicted that the habitat type and environmental factors such as humidity and temperature play a significant role in the distribution pattern of arthropods in any geographical region.

AB  - center dot Nematode abundance and footprint show unimodal patterns with precipitation levels.. MAP governed nematode diversity along the precipitation gradient of agroecosystem.
   center dot Soil pH determined nematode abundance and footprint in low precipitation levels. Precipitation plays a crucial role in global biodiversity change across terrestrial ecosystems.
   Precipitation is proven to affect soil organism diversity in natural ecosystems. However, how precipitation change affects the function of the soil nematode community remains unclear in cropland ecosystems. Here, we tested soil nematode communities from different precipitation sites (300 mm to 900 mm) of the agricultural ecosystem. The abundance of total nematodes, fungivores, and plant parasites, together with the footprint of fungivores was significantly affected by mean annual precipitation (MAP) in cropland ecosystem. Plant parasites diversity and footprint showed negative relationships with MAP. The random forest suggested plant parasite footprint was the most responsive to MAP. The structural equation model revealed that MAP affected nematode abundance and footprint indirectly via soil pH; nematode diversity was affected by MAP directly. We conclude that precipitation could act as the main selection stress for nematode diversity among the large gradient of agricultural ecosystems. However, the soil pH may act as a stress factor in determining nematode community and carbon flow in the soil food web. Our study emphasized that using nematode value by trophic group would provide a deep understanding of nematode response to precipitation in cropland ecosystems.

AB  - The OCBIL theory comprises a set of hypotheses to comprehend the biota of old, climatically buffered, infertile landscapes (OCBILs). Here, we review evidence from the literature to evaluate the extent to which this theory could apply to the biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia. We present geological, pedological and climatic evidence suggesting how the island might qualify as an OCBIL. The predictions of OCBIL theory are then reviewed in the context of New Caledonia. There is evidence for a high rate of micro-endemism, accumulation of relict lineages, a high incidence of dioecy, myrmecochory and nutritional specializations in plants. New Caledonian vegetation also exhibits several types of monodominant formations that reveal the importance of disturbances on the island. Fires and tropical storms are likely to be important factors that contribute to the dynamic of New Caledonian ecosystems. Although naturally infertile, there is archaeological evidence that humans developed specific horticultural practices in the ultramafic landscapes of New Caledonia. Further comparisons between New Caledonia and other areas of the world, such as South Africa and Southwest Australia, are desirable, to develop the OCBIL theory into a more robust and generalized, testable framework and to determine the most efficient strategies to preserve their outstanding biodiversity.

AB  - Plant predation by insects is a major driver of high plant diversity in modern tropical forests. Previous reports of leaf damage in middle-late Paleocene Neotropical rainforests of Cerrejon, Colombia, show that leaf herbivory was abundant but of low diversity, mainly inflicted by generalized feeders. Here, we present and describe plant-insect associations in leaf fossils from the middle-late Paleocene Bogota Formation, central Colombia, to test whether the high abundance and low richness of insect damage typified early evolving Neotropical rainforests. The Bogota flora records the highest richness and frequency of insect-damage associations among comparable Paleocene floras in North America, Patagonia, and Europe, as well as the highest number of leaf mines and galling associations. These results indicate that by the middle-late Paleocene, plant-insect herbivore interactions were much more intense and host-specialized in Neotropical rainforests of the Bogota region than elsewhere. The rich and frequent galling associations, a distinctive feature of the Bogota flora, are consistent with the preferential use of canopy leaves by galling insects seen in modern Neotropical rainforests. Our results also indicate differences in plantinsect associations among Paleocene Neotropical rainforests, perhaps reflecting a geographically heterogeneous ecological recovery from the end-Cretaceous ecological crisis. Plant insect-associations in the Bogota flora also suggest a deep historical context for negative density-dependence as a potential driver (and maintainer) of the high plant diversity observed in modern Neotropical rainforests.

AB  - Various restoration programs have been implemented worldwide to recover degraded ecosystems. Nepal implemented a signature policy- Scientific Forest Management (SciFM)-with the aim of restoring and enhancing forest conditions, as well as increasing employment, timber production and economic growth in the last decade. While SciFM might achieve these objectives, it may conflict with Nepal's own biodiversity and emission reduction policies. So far, various aspects of SciFM, such as stakeholders' opinion, policy issues, and financial analysis have been conducted. However, the effect of SciFM in achieving various restoration objectives remains unexplored. Taking a case of Sal (Shorea robusta) dominated forest which resembles productive forests in the lowlands of Nepal, we evaluated land productivity, carbon, and biodiversity outcomes of SciFM. Employing the methods of policy review (n = 6), literature review (n = 35), expert consultations (n = 15), and forest and soil inventory, we found that SciFM has been beneficial for establishing regeneration of Sal. However, in the short-run, SciFM was found to be counterproductive to achieve national objectives of REDD+ (reducing carbon emissions from forestry sector), biodiversity conservation, and land productivity enhancement. Based on our analysis, we have discussed some learning areas from SciFM practices to align with the restoration objectives at a national and global scale. Implications of the findings in the other parts of the world, who are also implementing intensive forest management programs, are highlighted.

AB  - An alarming and increasing deforestation rate threatens Amazon tropical ecosystems and subsequent degradation due to frequent fires. Agroforestry systems (AFS) may offer a sustainable alternative, reportedly mimicking the plant-soil interactions of the natural mature forest (MF). However, the role of microbial community in tropical AFS remains largely unknown. This knowledge is crucial for evaluating the sustainability of AFS and practices given the key role of microbes in the aboveground-belowground interactions. The current study, by comparing different AFS and successions of secondary and MFs, showed that AFS fostered distinct groups of bacterial community, diverging from the MFs, likely a result of management practices while secondary forests converged to the same soil microbiome found in the MF, by favoring the same groups of fungi. Model simulations reveal that AFS would require profound changes in aboveground biomass and in soil factors to reach the same microbiome found in MFs. In summary, AFS practices did not result in ecosystems mimicking natural forest plant-soil interactions but rather reshaped the ecosystem to a completely different relation between aboveground biomass, soil abiotic properties, and the soil microbiome.

AB  - The long-term contribution of global forest restoration to support multiple dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystem function remains largely illusive across contrasting climates and forest types. This hampers the capacity to predict the future of forest rewilding under changing global climates. Here, 120 studies are synthesized across five continents, and it is found that forest restoration promotes multiple dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystem function such as soil fertility, plant biomass, microbial habitat, and carbon sequestration across contrasting climates and forest types. Based on global relationship between stand age and soil organic carbon stock, planting 350 million hectares of forest under the UN Bonn Challenge can sequester >30 Gt soil C in the surface 20 cm over the next century. However, these findings also indicate that predicted increases in temperature and reductions in precipitation can constrain the positive effects of forest rewilding on biodiversity and ecosystem function. Further, important tradeoffs are found in very old forests, with considerable disconnection between biodiversity and ecosystem function. Together, these findings provide evidence of the importance of the multidimensional rewilding of forests, suggesting that on-going climatic changes may dampen the expectations of the positive effects of forest restoration on biodiversity and ecosystem function.

AB  - Termites play a vital role in litter decomposition, yet a comprehensive global-scale quantitative analysis of their effects and key drivers still needs to be developed. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis using 187 observations to evaluate the impacts and drivers of termite influence on litter decomposition. Our findings revealed that termites enhanced litter decomposition by an average of 41.2% globally, with mean annual precipitation (MAP) being the primary factor driving termite effects. Moreover, termites exert a more substantial influence on woody litter decomposition compared to foliar litter, whereas they play a more influential role in forests than in grasslands, showing a more significant impact on litter placed on the soil surface than underground. Additionally, MAP acts as the sole dominant driver of decomposition in woody litter, while both MAP and mean annual temperature (MAT) are the key factors affecting the termite-drived litter decomposition in the forest. MAP, MAT and elevation were also detected as the dominant factors in regulating the degradation of plant debris when litter is placed on the soil surface or using meshbag to exclude termites. Our results indicated that termites could significantly contribute to litter decomposition, and MAP mainly derives these material recycling processes globally and regionally.

AB  - Alterations in global climate via extreme precipitation will have broadscale implications on ecosystem functioning. The increased frequency of drought, coupled with heavy, episodic rainfall are likely to generate impacts on biotic and abiotic processes across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the demonstrated shifts in global precipitation, less is known how extreme precipitation interacts with biophysical factors to control future demographic processes, especially those sensitive to climate extremes such as organismal recruitment and survival. We utilized a field-based precipitation manipulation experiment in 0.1 ha forest canopy openings to test future climate scenarios characterized by extreme precipitation on temperate tree seedling survival. The effects of planting seedbeds (undisturbed leaf litter/organic material vs. scarified, exposed mineral soils), seedling ontogeny, species, and functional traits were examined against four statistically defined precipitation scenarios. Results indicated that seedlings grown within precipitation treatments characterized by heavy, episodic rainfall preceded by prolonged drying responded similarly to drought treatments lacking episodic inputs. Moreover, among all treatment conditions tested, scarified seedbeds most strongly affected seedling survivorship (odds ratio 6.9). Compared with any precipitation treatment, the effect size (predicted probabilities) of the seedbed was more than twice as important in controlling seedling survivorship. However, the interaction between precipitation and seedbed resulted in a 27.9% improvement in survivorship for moisture-sensitive species. Seedling sensitivity to moisture was variable among species, and most closely linked with functional traits such as seed mass. For instance, under dry moisture regimes, survivorship increased linearly with seed mass (log transformed; adjusted R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.001), yet no relationship was apparent under wet moisture regimes. Although precipitation influenced survival, extreme rainfall events were not enough to offset moisture deficits nor provide a rescue effect under drought conditions. The relationships reported here highlight the importance of plant seedbeds and species (e.g., functional traits) as edaphic and biotic controls that modify the influence of extreme future precipitation on seedling survival in temperate forests. Finally, we demonstrated the biophysical factors that were most influential to early forest development and that may override the negative effects of increasingly variable precipitation. This work contributes to refinements of species distribution models and can inform reforestation strategies intended to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem function under increasing climate extremes.

AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems are driven by different global change factors, such as atmospheric nitrogen deposition and precipitation reduction. Nitrogen deposition and precipitation reduction have a great impact on the aboveand underground processes. Most previous studies mainly focused on the effects of nitrogen deposition and/or precipitation reduction on aboveground processes, while the effects on underground processes were relatively scarce. As an important part of the underground soil food web, soil nematode community occupies different nutritional niches and is sensitive to external disturbances, and it is often used as indicator for studying underground processes. However, we know little about the response of soil nematode community to nitrogen deposition and/or precipitation reduction. Here, we used a 10-year of factorial manipulation by applying nitrogen solution and reducing the amount of precipitation to the soil, and to investigate the responses of soil nematode community to nitrogen deposition and/or precipitation reduction in a temperate forest. We expected that nitrogen addition could promote while precipitation inhibited the activity of soil nematode community. Furthermore, we expected nitrogen addition and precipitation could have interactive effect on soil nematode community. Our results found that nitrogen addition and/or precipitation reduction treatment caused significant changes in the composition of soil nematode community. Nitrogen addition and nitrogen addition combined with precipitation reduction induced negative effects and significantly decreased the abundance and diversity of soil nematode community, while precipitation reduction only decreased the abundance of soil nematode community. Nitrogen addition and precipitation reduction had synergistic effect on soil nematode community with higher trophic levels. Compared with precipitation reduction treatment, the negative effect of nitrogen addition on soil nematode community was more severe. According to the structural equation model (SEM), we found that nitrogen addition and precipitation reduction could affect the abundance of soil nematode community by affecting the plant richness and soil pH. Since the decrease of enrichment index (EI) and the increase of structure index (SI), our research results revealed that nitrogen addition could lead to soil food web in a lower nutrients available condition.

AB  - Introduction: Forests in the Mediterranean basin are currently in decline. Their resilience has been eroded as a result of climate change and anthropogenic impacts, making them vulnerable to increasingly frequent episodes of drought, fire and the spread of pests and diseases. The impact of these natural and anthropogenic events on soil biodiversity is of particular concern, as the soil fungal community plays a key role in ecosystem homeostasis.Objectives and methods: In order to analyse the relationship between soil health status and fungal diversity, soil samples were collected from declining Mediterranean forests of Castanea sativa (chestnut), Quercus ilex (holm oak), Quercus suber (cork oak) and Quercus pyrenaica (Pyrenean oak). A metabarcoding study was carried out by sequencing the ITS genomic region.Results: A total of 674 fungal genera were found. It has not been possible to explain the differences in health status from the fungal genera found exclusively on declining forest soils, as none of them have been described as pathogenic. Healthy chestnut soils were characterized by a high alpha diversity and a higher abundance of the genus Metarhizium. No differentially abundant genera were found in any of the other forest species tested. Declining chestnut soils harbored more abundance of ectomycorrhizae and soil saprotrophs than healthy samples. Ectomycorrhizae were the dominant lifestyle in all oak species regardless of health status, whereas arbuscular mycorrhizae were preferentially found in declining cork oak soils.Discussion: This work highlights the resilience of fungal communities of soil against decline and highlights the need to further investigate its relationship with the forest's ability to cope with the challenges of climate change.

AB  - Biodiversity is a crucial indicator of the health and resilience of ecosystems. Accurate estimation and prediction of biodiversity can support effective ecological management practices. This study aimed to estimate and predict biodiversity based on Environmental Factors (EFs), using Machine Learning (ML) including Deep Learning (DL) algorithms. First, the importance of EFs, including Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP), slope, aspect, and elevation, in influencing biodiversity was evaluated using Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (MRMR) and Recursive Feature Elimination with Relief Feature Selection (RReliefF), and their correlations with multi-spatial biodiversity indices were analyzed. Our findings revealed that MAP was the most important environmental variable in estimating biodiversity, followed by slope, aspect, and elevation. Next, the ability of four ML algorithms (multiple linear regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine) and a deep neural network (DNN) to estimate biodiversity was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (r-square) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) metrics. The DNN model achieved the highest accuracy (r-square: 0.884) among the ML algorithms and was further optimized to determine the optimal level of model complexity. These findings highlight the potential of DNN to effectively estimate biodiversity and suggest that using EF features with DL algorithms can improve our understanding of the relationships between environmental drivers and biodiversity, providing valuable insights for conservation and management decision-making towards sustainable development.

AB  - Global warming causes an increase in precipitation distribution, soil moisture, river and groundwater changes and evaporation, and has negative effects on sectors such as water supply-sanitation, ecosystems and biodiversity, agriculture, health, land use and forestry, urban settlements and infrastructure. Climate change projections show that the availability and accessibility of water resources will be directly affected. Turkey will primarily be affected by the decrease in water resources and drought, which will occur with the increase in temperature and decrease in precipitation. According to the pessimistic scenario, effects such as decrease in river flows and groundwater, increase in evaporation, decrease in soil moisture will occur. If the total water used in different sectors in Turkey is compared to the freshwater source, the water use index is approximately 26% and it is in the position of the country experiencing water stress. There is also a 10% decrease in precipitation and an increase in heavy precipitation in Sakarya province and the sectors that will be affected by these change are primarily water resources, agriculture, urban infrastructure, biodiversity, public health and industry. It is important and necessary to reduce the impact of climate change on water resources and improve the capacity to adapt to changes in order to strengthen water security, reduce disaster risk, and increase the resilience of ecosystems and economies. In this study, within the framework of adaptation studies to climate changes, sectoral effects, risks, fragility and opportunities were evaluated both in general and in Sakarya province, and local solution proposals were presented.

AB  - We investigated the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystem services and their components in two distinct ecosystems: the northern grasslands and southern hills in China. The effects of minimum, average, and maximum temperature, and precipitation at monthly, seasonal, and yearly scales on ecosystem services and their components were studied through stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results showed that in the northern grasslands, an increase in the total ecosystem services value (ESV) was mainly attributed to soil conservation, biodiversity, hydrological regulation, and aesthetic landscape. In the southern hills, an increase in total ESV in each region was mainly attributed to climate regulation, environmental purification, biodiversity, and aesthetic landscape. There were strong correlations between ESVs and fluctuations in temperature and precipitation. In the northern grasslands, temperature was the main driving factor of the values from 11 categories of ecosystem services in Anxi, Tumuji, and Xilingol. However, in West Ordos, precipitation negatively affected the change in ESVs. In the southern hills, ESVs were governed by both precipitation and temperature in Huaying. Precipitation variables were an important factor affecting the ESVs in Cili. There was a stronger correlation between temperature and the majority of ESVs in Danjiangkou, Chongyi, and Lechang than precipitation. This paper provides a basis for a better understanding of the impact of climate change on different ecosystem services, and helps to enhance ESV under climate warming.

AB  - The effects of anomalous weather conditions (such as extreme temperatures and precipitation) on CO2 flux variability in different tropical ecosystems were assessed using available reanalysis data, as well as information about daily net CO2 fluxes from the global FLUXNET database. A working hypothesis of the study suggests that the response of tropical vegetation can differ depending on local geographical conditions and intensity of temperature and precipitation anomalies. The results highlighted the large diversity of CO2 flux responses to the fluctuations of temperature and precipitation in tropical ecosystems that may differ significantly from some previously documented relationships (e.g., higher CO2 emission under the drier and hotter weather, higher CO2 uptake under colder and wetter weather conditions). They showed that heavy precipitation mainly leads to the strong intensification of mean daily CO2 release into the atmosphere at almost all stations and in all types of study biomes. For the majority of considered tropical ecosystems, the intensification of daily CO2 emission during cold and wet weather was found, whereas the ecosystems were predominantly served as CO2 sinks from the atmosphere under hot/dry conditions. Such disparate responses suggested that positive and negative temperature and precipitation anomalies influence Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (ER) rates differently that may result in various responses of Net Ecosystem Exchanges (NEE) of CO2 to external impacts. Their responses may also depend on various local biotic and abiotic factors, including plant canopy age and structure, plant biodiversity and plasticity, soil organic carbon and water availability, surface topography, solar radiation fluctuation, etc.

AB  - China's drylands encompass an area of approximately 6.60 x 106 km2 and are home to around 580 million people, providing crucial ecosystem services. The escalating impacts of global climate change are expected to exacerbate aridity, thereby adversely affecting ecosystem services and human well-being. Hence, there is a crucial need to prioritize the study of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) in drylands and investigate the underlying factors driving EMF changes. We collected field sampling and indoor analysis data, as well as raster level sampling data to obtain indices related to soil nutrients, vegetation, human footprint index (HFI), soil biodiversity index (SBI), and climate (mean annual temperature [MAT], mean annual precipitation [MAP], potential evapotranspiration [PET]), and soil characteristics (soil sand content [Sand], soil moisture [SM], soil pH). EMF was calculated using the averaging approach, and the cluster-multi-threshold approach. We employed the mantel test, mixed-effects model, random forest algorithm, piecewise structural equation model, and variation partition analysis to explore the significance of factors on EMF changes. The findings revealed significant correlations between EMF and all factors except pH and Sand. All factors collectively accounted for 52.7 %-57.4 % of the variation in mono- (the effect on each of the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus functions separately) and multifunctionality. The combined effects of all factors had the greatest contribution (8.1 %-16.3 %) variation in EMF. HFI consistently emerged as the most important factor in controlling EMF variation and proved to be the most significant predictor of EMF changes. All factors examined were significant predictors of EMF change. Our study demonstrated that HFI played the most direct influence on EMF changes, surpassing the impact of any single variable. However, the overall contribution of climate (integrating MAP, MAT, and PET) to EMF change was also extremely important. Therefore, future assessments and predictions of ecological functions in drylands should consider not only the direct effects of climate change but also the integrated analysis of human impact.

AB  - Assessments of ecosystem restoration have traditionally focused on soil and vegetation, often with little consideration of fauna. It is critical to include fauna in such assessments, not just because of their intrinsic biodiversity value but also because of the many ecological roles that animals play in restoration processes. However, a widely accepted framework for specifying faunal standards for restoration is lacking. Here we present such a framework, incorporating: (1) the identification of appropriate reference conditions; (2) the taxa to be targeted for assessment; (3) the attributes of these taxa to be measured; (4) acceptable similarity with reference conditions; and (5) robust sampling methodologies for reliable assessment. We illustrate this framework using the restoration program at Ranger Uranium Mine in the Australian seasonal tropics, which aims to establish an environment similar to the surrounding World Heritage-listed Kakadu National Park, corresponding to "full recovery" according to Society for Ecosystem Restoration's standards. Our case study has especially high restoration standards, but our framework has wide applicability to the specification of faunal standards for ecosystem restoration.

AB  - Aim Deterministic and neutral processes shape the biogeography of fungi. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), an important group of plant root symbionts, remains poorly studied in the Neotropics. Here, we provided the first molecular survey of AMF diversity and tested whether the environment or space shapes AMF biogeography along a 12 degrees latitudinal transect in the Brazilian Caatinga, a unique tropical dry forest ecoregion. Location Caatinga, Brazil. Taxon Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycotina). Methods Soil and root samples were collected across a latitudinal transect of 1500 km within the Brazilian Caatinga. AMF communities were characterized using Illumina LSU amplicon sequencing. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) richness, composition and phylogenetic niche conservatism were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses, and the potential for new taxa discovery was assessed with BLAST analysis against reference and environmental sequences sets. Result Glomeraceae was the most abundant and diverse family, resembling more dry Saharo-Arabian and Australian realms or European croplands than other tropical forests from South America, but 10% of the OTUs could be taxa new to science, especially within Archaeospora, Claroideoglomus, Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Dentiscutata and Redeckera. AMF communities showed strong biogeographical structure inconsistent with a classical latitudinal diversity gradient, which further differed between soil and roots. Soil AMF biogeography best correlated with precipitation; community composition converged and richness increased towards both ends of the latitudinal transect where precipitation increased. Root AMF biogeography correlated to temperature, with decreasing diversity at higher temperatures. We found no evidence of phylogenetic niche conservatism. Main conclusions Niche-based processes driven by regional climate, most importantly precipitation and temperature, shape AMF biogeography across the Caatinga, with niche divergence among closely related AMF taxa. Given the expected future decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature, climate change may strongly affect the unique and yet unknown AMF biodiversity in neotropical dry forests.

AB  - Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and changing precipitation regimes greatly affect the structure and func-tions of terrestrial ecosystems. However, their impacts on the diversity and assembly of soil microbial commu-nities including bacteria, fungi and protists, remain largely unclear. As part of a six-year field experiment in a secondary forest in a warm temperate and subtropical climate transitional zone in China, we aimed to investigate the responses of soil microbial communities to N addition, increased and decreased precipitation. The results showed that N addition had no effect on soil microbial a-or 8-diversity, but reduced the complexity of microbial network. Neither increased nor decreased precipitation influenced soil microbial a-diversity, but decreased precipitation rather than increased precipitation elevated bacterial and protistan community dissimilarities (8-diversity), which could have been largely attributed to species replacement processes through reducing soil water availability. In addition, decreased precipitation weakened microbial complexity and stability, but enhanced the node proportion of protists in the co-occurrence network. Our observations suggest the asymmetric responses of soil microbial 8-diversity to increased and decreased precipitation, and underscore that water rather than N availability, especially drought condition, plays a predominant role in modulating soil microbial beta-diversity. Moreover, the findings imply that global change can strengthen the importance of soil protists and then reshape microbial assembly in forests.

AB  - Globally, the great majority of Anillini species are endogean, adapted to live in the interstices of soil and leaf litter, while the extremely low vagility of these minute ground beetles gives rise to numerous shortrange endemic species. Until recently the Australian Anillini fauna was known only from leaf litter in rain forests and eucalypt forests in the wetter, forested regions of eastern and south eastern Australia, as well as Lord Howe and Norfolk islands. The first hypogean Anillini in Australia (17 species in six genera) were described in 2016 from mineral exploration drill holes in iron-ore bearing rocks of the Pilbara region in Western Australia, representing the first finding of the tribe deep underground in a semi-arid climate region. A further eight new genera and 20 new species are described herein, mostly from the Pilbara region as well as the semi-arid Kimberley and Goldfields regions; all were collected in mineral exploration drill holes.

AB  - As a response to the increased pressure of global climate change on most ecosystems, national and international agreements aim at creating forests that are productive, resilient to climate change, and that store carbon to mitigate global warming. However, these aims are being challenged by increased tree mortality rates and decreased tree growth rates in response to increased incidence of extreme drought events. These phenomena make us aware of a lack of crucial insights into the effects of forest management on the growth and survival of trees, and on carbon storage in both trees and forest soils under increased incidence of drought. Here we compile current knowledge on how forest management and drought impact on tree growth and survival, and above-and belowground carbon storage in forest ecosystems. Based on this, we propose that climate-smart forestry may benefit from controlling stand density at intermediate levels (>60%, e.g.similar to 80%) by applying low levels of tree harvest intensity on a regular base. Furthermore, we propose that the actual optimal density will depend on the tree species, site conditions and management history. As a next step, studies are needed that take an above-and belowground approach and combine forest experiments with mechanistic models on water, carbon and nutrient flows in trees and soils within forests in order to transform current results, which focus on either soil or trees and are often highly-context dependent, to a more generic forest framework. Such a generic framework would be needed to enhance understanding across forest ecosystems on how forest management may promote forest resilience, productivity and carbon storage with increasing drought.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewAs litter decomposition is a fundamental process in forest ecosystems, representing the link between aboveground and belowground biogeochemical processes, we developed an effect size summarisation of the implications of forest management on litter decomposition rate, by applying a multi-level meta-analysis and multivariate mixed-effects meta-analytic linear models. Our aim was to review the findings of the current literature and to understand how forest management, silvicultural treatment, and forest operations could affect litter decomposition rate. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of environmental variables that included stand type, climatic conditions, and the percentage of biomass removal on litter decomposition rate.Recent FindingsWe found a statistically significant reduction in litter decomposition rate associated with clear-cutting, and no statistically significant differences for the overall effects of retention forestry and logging activities (disturbed forest soil in the form of skid trails or strip roads). Concerning the sub-group analysis and multivariate meta-regression, there were no significant effects for stand type (broadleaf, coniferous, or mixed) or climatic conditions (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation). The percentage of biomass removal showed a significant positive correlation with the effect size, thus indicating that higher biomass removal in the framework of retention forestry leads to an increase in litter decomposition rate. Also, the mesh size of the litterbag showed a positive correlation with the effect size, suggesting that there is a probability of a factor of stronger disturbance to large-body decomposer organisms such as microarthropods.Litter decomposition rate is related, among other factors, to soil microclimatic conditions and soil biota. Therefore, this process can be strongly influenced by active forest management, meant as a silvicultural treatment carried out by applying a given harvesting system. In the context of retention forestry, increased light availability seems to be the driving force in shaping increased litter decomposition rates with increasing biomass removal. On the other hand, when a clear-cut is applied, the stronger modification to the edaphic community leads to decreased litter decomposition rates. It is worth noting that the modification may also be related to soil manipulation to favour the establishment of artificial regeneration. The findings, however, showed very large variability, thus suggesting the need for further research on such a complex topic. Multidisciplinary studies that analyse the microclimate and the edaphic biological communities along with the litter decomposition are particularly recommended.

AB  - The soil water regime often controls whether an ecosystem is a source of greenhouse gases such as CO2 or CH4 or is, instead, a carbon sink. The soil water regime of wetland forests is complicated by ecosystem feedback and landscape scale interactions. An in-depth understanding of these processes is needed to optimize the management of such ecosystems to balance timber production, carbon sequestration and biodiversity preservation. To investigate the soil water regime of non-riparian wetland forests, we set up a physically based Hydrus-1D soil water model for two hydric black alder Alnus glutinosa sites in a lowland hemiboreal setting informed by field observations of the soil water. Further, to gain ecohydrological insights, we explored the correlations between modeled long-term soil water parameters and local dendrochronology. We found that, at the clay soil site, the simulated root water uptake had a significant correlation (up to 0.55) with the residual tree-ring chronology. However, in the sandy soil site, the meteorological conditions-air temperature and precipitation-were better predictors for tree radial growth (correlation up to 0.42). In addition, we observed a trend towards dryer conditions during the modeling period, which might enhance the growing conditions for the considered forest stands due to a reduction in soil waterlogging.

AB  - Fossil forests provide some of the most fascinating and compelling records of the geological past. If rapidly preserved in-situ, they yield multifaceted knowledge about the palaeoenvironment and habitat structure, diversity of organisms and their varied interrelationships. Further, fossil forests shed light on palaeoclimaric conditions and raphonomic pathways. Although discovered almost 300 years ago, only during the last decade, the Chemnitz Fossil Forest, central-east Germany, has been recognised as a complex fossil lagersratte represented by outstanding fossil assemblages preserved by pyroclastics. The fossil biota was buried as a T-0 thanarocoenosis resulting from instantaneous entombment by the Zeisigwald Tuff (Leukersdorf Formation, Chemnitz Basin). The eruptions constitute some of the last events of post-Variscan felsic volcanism in Central Europe and resulted in ash falls, pyroclasric surges, and flows, which ultimately covered and preserved the ecosystem. Based on magmatic zircons, the tuff yielded an age of 291 +/- 2 Ma (lace Sakmarian/early Artinskian).
   Fine-crystalline alpha-quartz, chalcedony, moganite, and particularly fluorite, which is restricted to plant fossils, pumice lapilli and vitreous matrix constituents, affected wood petrifaction. Organic remains in fossil wood are limited to scattered anthracite particles. Cathodoluminescence uncovered sire-specific multiphase silicification, including rapid precipitation under oxygen-deficiency in a low-temperature ( < 250 degrees C) hydrothermal environment.
   Attention is focused on two excavations in Chemnitz that recovered abundant new data and opened a unique window into a low-latitude 'wet spot' ecosystem. This spatially restricted habitat sheltered a dense hygrophilous arborescent vegetation of seed plants and cryptogams bur also epiphytes and climbers. The biota also includes a diverse fauna of vertebrates, arthropods and gastropods, several of them documented for the first rime from the Permian. Chemnitz reflects a relatively youthful but already well-established forest bionetwork with a remarkably well-developed trophic pyramid. Highlighted by many trees, still standing upright in their places of growth and rooted in the palaeosol, the Chemnitz Fossil Forest represents the most complete Permian forest biome/ecosystem recorded to date. To illustrate the environmental settings more precisely, palaeontological, pedological and geochemical indicators of deep-rime palaeoclimate have been rested. The ecosystem developed on a palaeosol of low maturity, even though it received annual precipitation of ca. 800-1100 mm. Although the habitat was affected by environmental disturbances and seasonality, conservative hygrophilous forms dominated the multi-aged vegetation. Growth features of woody trees provided excellent natural data archives and afforded reliable information, e.g., severe droughts and lightning strikes recorded as event rings and wound responses in affected trees. Tree-ring sequences were analysed to ascertain both annual growth rates and mean sensitivity and correlate growth increments between the trees. The tree-ring data provided insights into the fourth dimension (time), enabling appraisal of the stages of forest growth. The results yield a high-resolution palaeoenvironmental signal for eight decades during the early Permian and permit the recognition of fossil deadwood for the first time. Surprisingly, the woody trees, medullosan seed ferns, cordaitaleans, and calamitaleans revealed nearly 11-year cyclicity in tree-ring formation despite exhibiting different physiological reactions. The 11-year sunspot cycle, usually affecting atmospheric circulation patterns, was recorded in the trees and demonstrates how abiotic factors affect plant growth. Finally, multidisciplinary research achieved conclusions comparable to analyse modern ecosystems. The Chemnitz Fossil Lagerstatte significantly contributes to understanding the controls of palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironment, and palaeoecological dynamics on a confined wet-forest habitat of subtropical Northern Hemisphere Pangaea.

AB  - Aims Long-term determination of root biomass production upon land-use conversion to biofuel crops is rare. To assess land-use legacy influences on belowground biomass accumulation, we converted 22-year-old Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands and 50+-year-old agricultural (AGR) lands to corn (C), switchgrass (Sw) and restored prairie (Pr) biofuel crops. We maintained one CRP grassland as a reference (Ref). We hypothesized that land-use history and crop type have significant effects on root density, with perennial crops on CRP grasslands having a higher root biomass productivity, while corn grown on former agricultural lands produce the lowest root biomass.
   Methods The ingrowth core method was used to determine in situ ingrowth root biomass, alongside measurements of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). Ancillary measurements, including air temperature, growing season length and precipitation were used to examine their influences on root biomass production.
   Important Findings Root biomass productivity was the highest in unconverted CRP grassland (1716 g m(-2) yr(-1)) and lowest in corn fields (526 g m-2 yr-1). All perennial sites converted from CRP and AGR lands had lower root biomass and ANPP in the first year of planting but peaked in 2011 for switchgrass and a year later for restored prairies. Ecosystem stability was higher in restored prairies (AGR-Pr: 4.3 +/- 0.11; CRP-Pr: 4.1 +/- 0.10), with all monocultures exhibiting a lower stability. Root biomass production was positively related to ANPP (R-2 = 0.40). Overall, attention should be given to root biomass accumulation in large-scale biofuel production as it is a major source of carbon sequestration.

AB  - Soil respiration is of critical importance to the energy balance and element cycling of terrestrial ecosystems. Biodiversity loss and changes in rainfall regimes are predicted to increase, and in so doing have the potential to affect soil C cycling. However, uncertainties remain concerning the effects of tree diversity on soil respiration, and how these effects might be modified by altered water availability. Here, we measured the total soil respiration (R-S) and heterotrophic respiration (R-H) rates during the 2017 to 2019 growing seasons in stands dominated by Populus tremuloides, Pinus banksiana, and their relatively even mixtures under reduced (-25% throughfall), ambient, and added (+25% throughfall) precipitation in a boreal forest of Central Canada. We found that the R-S and R-H were 28% and 26% greater, respectively, in the mixtures than expected from those of monocultures that received ambient water availability, while the R-H/R-S were unaffected by tree mixtures. On average, the addition of water increased Rs and R-H by 19%, and 10%, respectively, with more pronounced increases of Rs in tree mixtures, which resulted in 55% higher Rs in mixtures relative to monocultures. In contrast, water reduction did not affect the Rs but decreased R-H in mixtures. Additionally, the effects of mixtures on R-H increased over the three-year duration of the experiments. Both the Rs and R-H decreased, while the R-H/Rs increased with higher soil fungal to bacterial ratios. Our results revealed that plant species mixtures and water availability interactively influenced soil respiration under natural conditions. We provided novel experimental insights, which indicated that the establishment of diverse forests can increase soil C cycling over time, particularly under increased water availability.

AB  - Understanding the consequences of altered rainfall patterns on litter decomposition is critical to predicting the feedback effect of climate change on atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Although their effect on microbial decomposition has received considerable attention, their effect on litter fragmentation by detritivores, the other dominant decomposition pathway, remains largely unexplored. Particularly, it remains unclear how different detritivore species and their interactions respond to changes in rainfall quantity and frequency. To fill this knowledge gap, we determined the contribution to litter decomposition of two detritivore species (millipede and isopod), separately and in combination, under contrasting rainfall quantity and frequency in a temperate forest. Although halving rainfall quantity and frequency decreased topsoil moisture by 7.8 and 13.1%, respectively, neither millipede- nor isopod-driven decomposition were affected by these changes. In contrast, decomposition driven by both detritivore species in combination was 65.5% higher than expected based on monospecific treatments under high rainfall quantity, but unchanged or even lower under low rainfall quantity. This indicates that although detritivore activity is relatively insensitive to changes in rainfall patterns, large synergistic interactions between detritivore species may disappear under future rainfall patterns. Incorporating interspecific interactions between decomposers thus seems critical to evaluate the sensitivity of decomposition to altered rainfall patterns.

AB  - Understanding biodiversity and biogeographic distribution of soil fauna is an important topic in ecology. While nematode communities have been compared among ecosystems, knowledge remains limited about how environmental factors and nematode distributions are linked at different spatial scales. Here, we employed high-throughput sequencing to compare nematode communities in tropical (Xishuangbanna), subtropical (Ailaoshan), and cold temperate spruce-fir (Lijiang) forest ecosystems with identical spatial sampling. Relationships between nematode communities and environmental factors were analyzed using redundancy analysis (RDA). Our results showed that nematode richness and diversity peaked in Xishuangbanna; however, no significant differences were observed in other two forest ecosystems. Bacterial feeders and Omnivores / Carnivores (Om & Ca) had the lowest relative abundance, but the highest diversity, in Xishuangbanna, with the opposite pattern being detected for fungal and plant feeders. Our data also demonstrated that, for forest ecosystems, climate factors drive nematode communities distributions at the regional scale, while terrain and soil characteristics (including pH and nutrients) drive nematode communities distributions at local scales. This study improves our current understanding of key factors (environmental parameters) responsible for the biogeographical distribution of forest nematode communities at different spatial scales.

AB  - Heavily exploited for its reddish, decay-resistant heartwood, the tallest conifer, Sequoia sempervirens, is a major component of coastal forests from extreme southwestern Oregon to California's Santa Lucia Mountains. Primary Sequoia forests are now restricted to < 5 % of their former distribution, and mature secondary forests with trees over 60 m tall are even scarcer due to repeated logging. Leveraging allometric equations recently derived from intensive work in both forest types, we climbed, measured, and core-sampled 235 trees in 45 locations distributed across the species range to examine growth trends and understand how tall Sequoia are responding to recent environmental changes. Paired samples of sapwood and heartwood collected along the height gradient were used to quantify Sequoia investment in decay resistance. During the 20th century, trees in most locations began producing more wood than expected for their size with this growth surge becoming pronounced after 1970 and ending around 2000. Radial increments-ring widths-correlate with climatic variables related to water availability, and these relationships are strengthening as temperatures rise. Sensitivity to drought increased from north to south along a 6 degrees latitudinal gradient of decreasing precipitation and summer fog frequency. Sequoia trees north of 40 degrees were least sensitive to drought, producing similar biomass annually during dry and wet years, whereas trees farther south produced less biomass during individual drought years. Hotter 21st century drought barely affected Sequoia growth efficiency (biomass increment per unit leaf mass) north of 40 degrees until the fourth consecutive year (2015), when growth efficiency dropped precipitously, recovering within two years. South of 40 degrees, Sequoia trees exhibited steadily declining growth efficiency during the multi-year drought followed by recovery, but recovery did not occur south of 37 degrees despite ample precipitation in 2017. Sequoia growth efficiency is currently highest in secondary forests north of 40 degrees, where trees produce relatively small amounts of heartwood with the lowest decay resistance (least fungicide) while receiving the most nocturnal summer fog. Increasing sink limitations, whereby rising temperatures, drier air at night, and extreme tree height collectively lower turgor pressure to inhibit cambial activity, may reduce Sequoia growth efficiency while contributing to more durable biomass production. Heartwood and fungicide increments are higher in primary than secondary forests across the species range. Crown structural complexity promotes development of vascular epiphytes and arboreal soil habitats in Sequoia forests with sufficient moisture availability. These habitats are lacking in secondary forests and rare in primary forests south of 40 degrees. After logging, restoration of tall Sequoia forests can be achieved via silviculture that maximizes height increments during early stand development and then retains some dominant trees in perpetuity, allowing them to gain full stature, produce increasingly decay-resistant heartwood, and support significant arboreal biodiversity.

AB  - Expansion of oil palm has caused widespread declines in biodiversity and changes in ecosystem functioning across the tropics. A major driver of these changes is loss of habitat heterogeneity as forests are converted into oil palm plantations. Therefore, one strategy to help support biodiversity and functioning in oil palm is to increase habitat heterogeneity, for instance, by retaining forested buffers around rivers when new plantations are established, or maintaining buffers made of mature oil palms ("mature palm buffers") when old plantations are replanted. While forested buffers are known to benefit oil palm systems, the impacts of mature palm buffers are less certain. In this study, we assessed the benefits of mature palm buffers, which were being passively restored (in this case, meaning that buffers were treated with no herbicides, pesticides, or fertilizers) by sampling environmental conditions and arthropods within buffers and in surrounding non-buffer areas (i.e., areas that were 25 and 125 m from buffers, and receiving normal business-as-usual management) across an 8-year chronosequence in industrial oil palm plantations (Sumatra, Indonesia). We ask (1) Do environmental conditions and biodiversity differ between buffer and non-buffer areas? (2) Do buffers affect environmental conditions and biodiversity in adjacent non-buffer areas (i.e., areas that were 25 m from buffers)? (3) Do buffers become more environmentally complex and biodiverse over time? We found that buffers can have environmental conditions (canopy openness, variation in openness, vegetation height, ground cover, and soil temperature) and levels of arthropod biodiversity (total arthropod abundance and spider abundance in the understory and spider species-level community composition in all microhabitats) that are different from those in non-buffer areas, but that these differences are inconsistent across the oil palm commercial life cycle. We also found that buffers might contribute to small increases in vegetation height and changes in ground cover in adjacent non-buffer areas, but do not increase levels of arthropod biodiversity in these areas. Finally, we found that canopy openness, variation in openness, and ground cover, but no aspects of arthropod biodiversity, change within buffers over time. Collectively, our findings indicate that mature palm buffers that are being passively restored can have greater environmental complexity and higher levels of arthropod biodiversity than non-buffer areas, particularly in comparison to recently replanted oil palm, but these benefits are not consistent across the crop commercial life cycle. If the goal of maintaining riparian buffers is to consistently increase habitat heterogeneity and improve biodiversity, an alternative to mature palm buffers or a move toward more active restoration of these areas is, therefore, probably required.

AB  - According to the widely accepted triangle model, global litter decomposition is collectively controlled by climate, litter initial quality, and decomposers. However, the specific contribution of soil arthropods to litter, especially the non-leaf litter, the decomposition of terrestrial ecosystems and its drivers are still unclear. We conducted a global meta-analysis based on 268 pairs of data to determine the contribution and pattern of soil arthropods to branch, stem, and root litter decomposition in farmlands, forests, and grasslands and analyzed the relationship of soil arthropods' decomposition effect and potential drivers. Our results showed that: (1) soil arthropods increased global non-leaf litter mass loss by 32.3%; (2) the contribution varied with climate zone and ecosystem type, with a value of subtropical (53.3%) > temperate (18.7%) > tropical (14.7%) and of farmlands (40.6%) > grasslands (34.3%) > forests (0.6%), respectively; (3) the soil arthropods' decomposition effect gradually decreased with decomposition time, and it was higher in litterbags with a mesh size of 1-2 mm (65.4%) and >2 mm (49.8%) than that of 0.5-1 mm (13.6%); (4) the soil arthropods' decomposition effects were negatively correlated with the litter initial C/N ratio, mean annual precipitation (MAP; p < 0.001), and elevation and was positively correlated with litter weight. In conclusion, soil arthropod promoted global non-leaf litter decomposition, and the contribution varied with climate zone, ecosystem type, and decomposition time as well as litterbag mesh size. Overall, this study improves the understanding of soil arthropods driving global non-leaf litter decomposition.

AB  - Leaf delta(15) N and delta C-13 are important functional traits in biogeographic studies of forest ecosystems. However, little is known about their relationships with soil fungal biodiversity, ectomycorrhizal and plant pathogenic abundance at large scales. In this study, leaf and soil samples were collected from 33 forest reserves along a large range across China to explore the associations between leaf delta N-15 and delta C-13 and soil fungal biodiversity, ectomycorrhizal and plant pathogenic relative abundance, using molecular and stable isotope techniques. Leaf delta N-15 was significantly positively correlated with the soil fungal Shannon index, significantly negatively correlated with the relative abundance of plant pathogens, and significantly positively correlated with the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizas. Leaf delta C-13 was significantly positively correlated with the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizas and significantly inverted unimodal correlated with the relative abundance of plant pathogens. Soil-plant-microbial interactions may contribute to variations in leaf delta N-15, delta C-13, and soil fungal communities among different types of forest ecosystems. Temperature and precipitation were the main factors that affected large-scale latitudinal and longitudinal biogeographic patterns. Leaf delta N-15 was mainly affected by the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi and leaf delta C-13 was affected by the mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. Leaf delta N-15 and delta C-13 may be indicators that reflect soil fungal communities in forest ecosystems.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the interactive influence of tree diversity and water availability on microbial functioning in surface soil (0-10 cm). The study was conducted at two field experiments (ages 4.2 and 9.0 years, respectively) of the TreeDivNet platform that established plantations with a gradient of tree species richness exposed to high and low water availability treatments. Soil microbial biomass, activity, functional diversity and functional identity were estimated using the MicroResp (TM) method. Soil organic carbon and several other variables potentially associated with soil processes (soil moisture, soil and air temperature, soil pH, soil C:N ratio, tree biomass) were also measured. Our results indicate that tree species richness significantly increased soil microbial biomass and, to a lesser extent, soil microbial activity in the high water availability treatment, at both trial sites. However, tree species richness effects on microbial processes were not expressed in the low water availability treatment, contrary to the stress-gradient hypothesis. Tree species richness and water treatment interaction impacted microbial biomass and activity through their effects on microbial functional diversity and identity at one site and air temperature at the other site. In conclusion, the mechanisms through which tree diversity creates bottom-up effects on biological soil processes depend on environmental conditions and time following the establishment of tree communities. Future research relating diversity and water availability effects on soil microbial processes should consider functional traits of tree species and a larger range of trophic levels including herbivores and soil fauna to better understand biodiversity-soil ecosystem function relationships in forest ecosystems.

AB  - North American boreal forests are known to be an important carbon pool in boreal ecosystems, but have experienced extensive tree mortality and carbon loss due to multiple agents of stand-replacing disturbances in recent decades. However, the impacts of these stand-replacing disturbances on forest dynamics are still unknown. We used a recently developed remote-sensing based stand-replacing disturbance product, coupled with aboveground biomass (AGB), gross primary productivity (GPP) and leaf area index (LAI) datasets to estimate the impacts of stand-replacing disturbances (e.g., fires, logging and insect outbreaks) on the carbon balance of western North American boreal forests during 2000-2012. Our results showed that fire, logging and insect outbreaks resulted in AGB losses of 23.4, 16.6, and 4.7 Tg/yr, respectively. In the post-disturbance periods, AGB did not recover to its pre-disturbed levels in the 10th year, which is longer than the recovery time of GPP and LAI. Furthermore, the losses of AGB, GPP and LAI in fire events were the dominant factors for forest recovery after stand-replacing fire. Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD), soil clay content, temperature and precipitation were the important factors for forest recovery after stand-replacing insect outbreaks and stand-replacing logging. When removing the impact of environmental factors, our results showed a smaller magnitude of AGB, GPP and LAI loss relative to the results including these factors, although similar recovery trajectories were observed among the two results. The results have important implications for understanding the effects of stand-replacing disturbances on the carbon dynamics of boreal forests, which is required to adopt effective forest management strategies after disturbance.

AB  - Sustainable forest management (SFM) practices can potentially reverse loss of forest cover due to deforestation, while concomitantly preserving and maintaining biodiversity, and stimulating jobs, income, and forest services. Recent studies found that significant logging residues (LR) (i.e. leaves, branches, and buttress roots) suitable for bioenergy production were often left in the felling area, triggering risks of forest fires and increased CO2 emissions due to wildfires or decomposition processes. For impact assessment of forest management practices, we collected primary harvesting data and estimated net primary productivity (NPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) for 13 forest plots in the Brazilian Amazon. We applied a process-based forestry growth model (BGC-Man) to analyze the impacts on forest dynamics of selective logging and removal of LR, subject to landscape, soil texture, and daily weather. We explored the following selective logging scenarios: the Legal Reserve (i.e. reference) scenario, a scenario with one cutting cycle over the whole period, and a scenario with three timber rotation periods of 30 yr. Two of the later scenarios were complemented with harvesting of the woody LR (o 10 cm) for charcoal production. For each scenario, we computed forest NPP and NEE over a 120 yr time horizon. Results suggest that using woody LR (i.e. 77% of total LR) for charcoal production would result in an economic gain equivalent to 24%-46% of the timber price. Our findings indicate that under scenarios where LR were removed, forest NPP recovered to the reference level and even higher, while income and jobs from harvesting LR for charcoal production were generated. We conclude that SFM could enhance forest productivity and deliver economic benefit from otherwise unexploited LR.

AB  - The potential patterns and processes of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) across global ecosystems are largely unknown, which limits our understanding of how ecosystems respond to drivers. Here we compile a global dataset that consists of 973 unique sites across the forest, grassland, and shrub ecosystems. We identify a critical global pattern of hump-shaped EMF relationship with mean annual precipitation at a threshold of similar to 671 mm, where low and high precipitation patterns are discriminated. We find that climatic and soil factors jointly drive the EMF in low precipitation areas, and climatic factors dominate the EMF in high precipitation regions. However, when comparing across the three dominant ecosystems and precipitation regions, the key driver in EMF differs substantially. Specifically, climatic and soil factors dominate the EMF of low and high precipitation regions across forest ecosystems, respectively. Climatic drivers dominate the EMF under different precipitation conditions across grassland and shrub ecosystems. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of climatic and soil drivers on EMF, which should be considered in ecosystem stability models in response to global climate and land-use change scenarios.

AB  - Seasonally dry tropical forests are strongly affected by anthropogenic disturbance and climate changes, which represent the main threats to soil biodiversity, affecting the activity and functional composition of soil com-munities that provide crucial ecosystem functions and services. However, the effects of these factors and their interactions on soil nematodes, which are bioindicators of soil quality and health, remain poorly understood in the seasonally dry tropical forests. Thus, we investigated the effects of land use and seasonality on the structure and function of nematode components of the soil food web in Caatinga dry forest, north-eastern Brazil. The study was conducted in Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco State, which covers 607 km2 of Caatinga vegetation. Soil samples were collected in dry and rainy seasons in three types of land use: mature forest, agricultural areas, and secondary forest. We quantified the abundance, biomass carbon and metabolic footprint of each functional guild of nematodes. In this study, a total of 104 and 115 nematode genera were identified in the dry and rainy season, respectively. The biomass carbon and metabolic footprints of the total nematode assemblage, and of bacterivores, fungivores and omnivore-predators, were affected by types of land use and seasons. The soil organic carbon and metabolic footprints of nematodes were lower in agricultural areas than in mature forest and secondary forest, and lower in the dry season than in the rainy season. In all types of land use and in both seasons, we verified that most resource assimilation into the soil food web was via the bacterial channel. The enrichment footprint was positively related to the level of soil organic carbon and the structure footprint to the enrichment footprint. In turn, the interactive effect between types of land use and seasonality was observed only for soil organic carbon, biomass carbon of omnivore-predators and the fungal footprint. In general, the differences between types of land use became more significant during the rainy season. In general, our study indicates that change of land use and rainfall in the Caatinga affect the magnitudes of ecosystem functions of functional guilds of nematodes.

AB  - Sweet chestnut is a relevant species in Europe for the production of timber and fruit, alongside environmental effects such as biodiversity of protection against soil erosion. In Portugal, chestnut is cultivated mainly for fruit production, in two areas, in the North and the South of the country, with moderate water deficit and low slope and at altitudes higher than 500 m. The current area (845 ha) of the southern so-called Marvao Protected Designation of Origin, of a fortyfold lower order of magnitude by comparison with the Northern productive area, has a significant expansion potential, given its similarity with contiguous areas in the same region. In this context, the main objective of the present work was the evaluation through geographic information analysis of that expansive potential, by comparison of physiographic profiling of the current production area with contiguous areas. A GIS-based characterization of current and potential chestnut areas in Marvao is presented. The methodology involved (i) digital profiling of the main classes/values of the geographical spatial ecological fingerprint considering topography, soil and microclimate variables in the areas currently occupied with sweet chestnut stands and (ii) the evaluation of the distribution of that environmental fingerprint in the whole Marvao productive area, for extending the cultivation to contiguous areas with a similar ecological fingerprint. An enlarged 9889 ha chestnut area was proposed, allocated for high forest stands aiming at agroforestry fruit production and coppiced stands for timber production and environmental protection, corresponding to 4590 ha and 5299 ha, respectively. Fruit production was proposed to field slopes of 0-4% and 4-8%, and altitudes between 400 m and 500 m. Presumable high-quality sites allocated to temporary dry/irrigated cultivations were also proposed for fruit production, in the same slope classes and altitudes higher than 500 m. Timber production and environmental protection were proposed for slopes within 8-12% and >12% ranges. This selection took into account the logistical feasibility facilitated in lower slopes for intensive mechanized management operations. This methodology permits a future field evaluation of site indexes, productivity, and correlations between environmental variables and stand biometry.

AB  - Soil macroarthropods, as a component of the soil community, directly feel the impact of land use chan-ges. Not only the density but understanding the soil macroarthropods distribution pattern will help in providing an insight into the quality of soil health. The sampling process was carried out using the pitfall trap methods on the forest, logged forest areas, mixed gardens, and monoculture gardens in the tropical rainforest of Bukit Pinang-Pinang Padang, Indonesia. The results showed that the forest as a natural habitat supported the density of soil macroar-thropods among other land use types. The density in the forest, logged forest area, mixed garden, and monoculture garden sequentially is about 20.29, 13.18, 15.2 and 12.21 indv/m2. The presence frequency high value of soil macroar-thropods was found in the forest, and for some soil macroarthropods, such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Araneits, the importance value increases when their habitat is disturbed. The fertile soil in intensive monoculture gardens does not support the individuals' total number, types, and density of soil macroarthropods. On the other side, the dominant soil macroarthropods prefer disturbed soil conditions and will decrease their presence frequency if che-mical compounds are introduced into the soil. Land use change in the Bukit Pinang-Pinang tropical rainforest area causes changes in the distribution pattern of soil macroarthropods. The changing tendency of distribution patterns in fragmented habitats is due to nutrient availability, limited resources and land treatment. Habitat fragmentation affects not only the abundance and density of individuals and types of soil macroarthropods but also the distribution pattern, which not only threatens their existence and the environment but also has the potential to regenerate.

AB  - BackgroundThe nationally determined contribution (NDC) presented by Argentina within the framework of the Paris Agreement is aligned with the decisions made in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on the reduction of emissions derived from deforestation and forest degradation, as well as forest carbon conservation (REDD+). In addition, climate change constitutes one of the greatest threats to forest biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks of native forests have not been incorporated into the Forest Reference Emission Levels calculations and for conservation planning under climate variability due to a lack of information. The objectives of this study were: (i) to model SOC stocks to 30 cm of native forests at a national scale using climatic, topographic and vegetation as predictor variables, and (ii) to relate SOC stocks with spatial-temporal remotely sensed indices to determine biodiversity conservation concerns due to threats from high inter-annual climate variability.MethodsWe used 1040 forest soil samples (0-30 cm) to generate spatially explicit estimates of SOC native forests in Argentina at a spatial resolution of approximately 200 m. We selected 52 potential predictive environmental covariates, which represent key factors for the spatial distribution of SOC. All covariate maps were uploaded to the Google Earth Engine cloud-based computing platform for subsequent modelling. To determine the biodiversity threats from high inter-annual climate variability, we employed the spatial-temporal satellite-derived indices based on Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and land surface temperature (LST) images from Landsat imagery.ResultsSOC model (0-30 cm depth) prediction accounted for 69% of the variation of this soil property across the whole native forest coverage in Argentina. Total mean SOC stock reached 2.81 Pg C (2.71-2.84 Pg C with a probability of 90%) for a total area of 460,790 km2, where Chaco forests represented 58.4% of total SOC stored, followed by Andean Patagonian forests (16.7%) and Espinal forests (10.0%). SOC stock model was fitted as a function of regional climate, which greatly influenced forest ecosystems, including precipitation (annual mean precipitation and precipitation of warmest quarter) and temperature (day land surface temperature, seasonality, maximum temperature of warmest month, month of maximum temperature, night land surface temperature, and monthly minimum temperature). Biodiversity was influenced by the SOC levels and the forest regions.ConclusionsIn the framework of the Kyoto Protocol and REDD+, information derived in the present work from the estimate of SOC in native forests can be incorporated into the annual National Inventory Report of Argentina to assist forest management proposals. It also gives insight into how native forests can be more resilient to reduce the impact of biodiversity loss.

AB  - The objectives were to quantify aboveground, belowground and dead wood carbon pools near Mayoko in the Chaillu massif of Republic of Congo and explore relationships between carbon storage and plant diversity of all growth forms. A total of 190 plots (25 m by 25 m) were sampled (5072 stems, 211 species) and data analysed using recommended central-African forest allometric equations. Mean stem diameter at breast height was 33.6 cm, mean basal area 47.7 m(2) ha(-1) and mean density of individuals 407 ha(-1). Mean aboveground carbon (AGC) ranged from 13.93-412.66 Mg C ha(-1), belowground carbon from 2.86-96.97 Mg C ha(-1) and dead wood from 0.00-7.59 Mg C ha(-1). The maximum AGC value recorded in a plot was 916 Mg C ha(-1). The analysis performed using phytosociological association as basis rather than broad vegetation type is unique. AGC values for undisturbed terra firme forest sites featured among the highest recorded for African tropical forests. Considering only tree diversity, a weak, yet significant, relationship existed between AGC and species richness, Shannon-Wiener index of diversity and Fisher's alpha. However, if diversity of all plant growth forms is considered, no relationship between carbon and plant diversity existed.

AB  - Seasonal dynamics in tropical forests are closely related to the variation in forest canopy gaps. The canopy gaps change continuously in shape and size between the rainy and dry seasons, leading to the variation in the vegetative indicators. To monitor the variation of the canopy gaps, UAVs were used to collect datas in the mentioned tropical forests at an altitude of over 1,000m in Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve, Vietnam with a post-processing image resolution of about 8cm, which allows the detection of relatively small gaps. The analysis results at 10 squares of 1 ha showed a decrease in the area of canopy gaps from the rainy season in September 2019 to the dry season of May 2020. The mixed broad-leaved or broadleaf forest dominates with a greater variation, when the area of the gaps decreases significantly. The variation in forest canopy gaps and vegetative indicators are closely related to the high differentiation of terrain, the seasonal and the dry season climatic characteristics. The fluctuation of the vegetation cover affects the habitats of the species under the forest canopy such as animals, birds and soil fauna. This is one of the scientific bases that contributes to the management and conservation of flora and fauna biodiversity, especially in mountainous tropical forests such as Ngoc Linh Nature Reserve.

AB  - Changes in soil microbial community play an irreplaceable role in regulating nutrient cycling that shapes forest ecosystem responses to climate change. However, if the effect of experimental warming on soil microorganisms depends upon soil water availability, which is closely related to soil depth is generally not well decumented. We conducted an in situ simulation experiment in an oak forest to determine the response pattern of soil microbial community to manipulated drought and warming at different soil depths. The responses of soil microbial communities to reduced precipitation and soil warming were highly dependent upon soil depth. Reduced precipitation remarkably elevated top-soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) in the unwarmed plots but no effects occured in the warmed plots. Soil warming showed positive effects on top-soil MBC and MBN under ambient precipitation, whereas negative ones were found under decreased precipitation. Neither reduced precipitation nor soil warming displayed effects on sub-soil MBC and MBN. Reduced precipitation notably increased soil total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) as well as that of bacterial and gram-negative bacterial only at top-soil in the unwarmed plots. Soil warming showed positive effects on total PLFA, bacterial PLFA, and gram-negative bacterial PLFA at both topand sub-soil under ambient precipitation. We found that the interactive effects of climate change on soil microorganisms varied with soil depth, indicating that multilayer soil models should be considered while assessing the relationship between soil and atmosphere carbon exchange. Further research is expected to explore the long-term response of soil microorganisms in soil vertical profiles to climate change. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Edaphic macrofauna is a biological soil indicator that is rarely applied in the identification of soil quality in coffee farms. The objective was to evaluate edaphic macrofauna and soil physico-chemical properties in four coffee farms at different altitudes. The farms were selected in four hamlets of small-scale coffee farmers. In one-hectare plantations, three monoliths of 25 x 25 cm wide by 30 cm depth were sampled. Soil samples were taken from each plot, then the organic matter (OM) content, hydrogen potential (pH), electrical conductivity (EC) and nitrogen (N) content were determined. There were no differences in macrofaunal diversity for the altitudes studied, but there were differences according to the time of year (rainfall and low water). The maximum Shannon index was 2.2 (rainy season) and 1.1 (dry season). Physico-chemical parameters such as soil pH ranged from 7.8 -8.15 in the lower altitude farms and for the higher altitude farms it was 6.38 -6.65. Soil pH was highly negatively correlated with altitude. Nitrogen was positively correlated with organic matter. Faunal diversity is negatively correlated with season and the presence of microorganisms is influenced by the physico-chemical characteristics of the soil.

AB  - Although spatial variation in climate can directly affect the survival and reproduction of forest insects and the tree species compositions of forests, little is known about the indirect effects of climate on outbreaks of forest insects through its effects on forest composition. In this study, we use structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of climate, water capacity of the soil, host tree density, and non-host density on the spatial extent of Lymantria dispar outbreaks in the Eastern USA over a period of 44 years (1975-2018). Host species were subdivided into four taxonomic and ecologically distinct groups: red oaks (Lobatae), white oaks (Lepidobalanus), other preferred hosts, and intermediate (less preferred) hosts. We found that mean annual temperature had stronger effects than mean annual precipitation on the spatial extent of outbreaks, and that indirect effects of temperature (via its effects on oak density) on defoliation were stronger than direct effects. The density of non-host trees increased with increasing precipitation and, consistent with the 'associational resistance hypothesis', defoliation decreased with increasing density of non-host trees. This study offers quantitative evidence that geographic variation in climate can indirectly affect outbreaks of a forest insect through its effects on tree species composition.

AB  - Forest canopy is densely populated by phyto-, sapro-, and microbiphages, as well as predators and parasitoids. Eventually, many of crown inhabitants fall down, forming so-called 'arthropod rain'. Although arthropod rain can be an important food source for litter-dwelling predators and saprophages, its origin and composition remains unexplored. We measured stable isotope composition of the arthropod rain in a temperate mixed forest throughout the growing season. Invertebrates forming arthropod rain were on average depleted in C-13 and N-15 by 1.6 parts per thousand and 2.7 parts per thousand, respectively, compared to the soil-dwelling animals. This difference can be used to detect the contribution of the arthropod rain to detrital food webs. Low average delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of the arthropod rain were primarily driven by the presence of wingless microhytophages, represented mainly by Collembola and Psocoptera, and macrophytophages, mainly aphids, caterpillars, and heteropterans. Winged arthropods were enriched in heavy isotopes relative to wingless specimens, being similar in the isotopic composition to soil-dwelling invertebrates. Moreover, there was no consistent difference in delta C-13 and delta N-15 values between saprophages and predators among winged insects, suggesting that winged insects in the arthropod rain represented a random assemblage of specimens originating in different biotopes, and are tightly linked to soil food webs.

AB  - Biodiversity-biomass relationships have been debated for decades and remain subject to controversy. Understanding the relationship between biodiversity and biomass will be crucial for soil and water conservation of the whole basin of the Yellow River. The positive effects of biodiversity on aboveground biomass are altered via two fundamental mechanisms-niche complementarity and selection effects-and are modulated by environmental context and community structure in natural communities. Most studies of biodiversity-biomass relationships have focused on grasslands and forests, rather than on shrublands. We combine multiple biotic variables (biodiversity, functional identity and community structural attributes) and environmental context with aboveground biomass across shrubland habitat types (temperate hilly, temperate montane and subtropical montane) at neighbourhood and community spatial scales, to evaluate the effects of these factors on shrubland aboveground biomass, in the Yellow River basin. We found aboveground biomass was influenced primarily by the community-weighted mean plant maximum height, followed by species richness and community-weighted mean specific leaf area. Furthermore, individual plant size inequality, mean annual precipitation and water availability either directly or indirectly influenced aboveground biomass. The biodiversity-aboveground biomass relationship was stronger at the broader spatial scale. Thus, our findings indicate that both niche complementarity and selection effects shape the effects of biodiversity on shrubland aboveground biomass, although selection effects are more important. Moreover, they indicate that water is the most important environmental factor for determining aboveground biomass, and suggest that community structure and spatial scale could influence shrubland aboveground biomass and its response to biodiversity.

AB  - Many marine species are specialized to specific parts of a habitat. In a mangrove forest, for instance, species may be restricted to the mud surface, the roots and trunks of mangrove trees, or rotting logs, which can be regarded as distinct microhabitats. Shifts to new microhabitats may be an important driver of sympatric speciation. However, the evolutionary history of these shifts is still poorly understood in most groups of marine organisms, because it requires a well-supported phylogeny with relatively complete taxon sampling. Onchidiid slugs are an ideal case study for the evolutionary history of habitat and microhabitat shifts because onchidiid species are specialized to different tidal zones and microhabitats in mangrove forests and rocky shores, and the taxonomy of the family in the Indo-West Pacific has been recently revised in a series of monographs. Here, DNA sequences for onchidiid species from the North and East Pacific, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic are used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among Onchidella species, and are combined with new data for Indo-West Pacific species to reconstruct a global phylogeny of the family. The phylogenetic relationships of onchidiid slugs are reconstructed based on three mitochondrial markers (COI, 12S, 16S) and three nuclear markers (28S, ITS2, H3) and nearly complete taxon sampling (all 13 genera and 62 of the 67 species). The highly-supported phylogeny presented here suggests that ancestral onchidiids most likely lived in the rocky intertidal, and that a lineage restricted to the tropical Indo-West Pacific colonized new habitats, including mudflats, mangrove forests, and high-elevation rainforests. Many onchidiid species in the Indo-West Pacific diverged during the Miocene, around the same time that a high diversity of mangrove plants appears in the fossil record, while divergence among Onchidella species occurred earlier, likely beginning in the Eocene. It is demonstrated that ecological specialization to microhabitats underlies the divergence between onchidiid genera, as well as the diversification through sympatric speciation in the genera Wallaconchis and Platevindex. The geographic distributions of onchidiid species also indicate that allopatric speciation played a key role in the diversification of several genera, especially Onchidella and Peronia. The evolutionary history of several morphological traits (penial gland, rectal gland, dorsal eyes, intestinal loops) is examined in relation to habitat and microhabitat evolutionary transitions and suggests that the rectal gland of onchidiids is an adaptation to high intertidal and terrestrial habitats.

AB  - The conversion of natural areas into agricultural systems and silviculture is the greatest threat to biodiversity in tropical ecosystems such as the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). This landscape transformation could lead to the loss of native species, including ants that cannot tolerate the new environment dominated by exotic plant species, such as Eucalyptus spp. The present study aims to investigate ant diversity and their functional groups to verify which vegetation and landscape variables explain their changes in a neglected formation of Cerrado (Campos Murundus) surrounded by Eucalyptus forests planted. We sampled ants in 29 sites, which presented a gradient of richness, average plant heights, and distances from Eucalyptus plantations and permanent protected areas (PPAs). We found 83 ant species from six functional guilds (arboreal, Camponotini, epigeic omnivorous, higher Attini, lower Attini and specialist predators). Plant richness best explained the diversity of ants. Higher distance from Eucalyptus plantations also positively explained the frequency of functional groups, whereas higher distance from the PPAs negatively explained the frequency of Camponotini species. Our study showed that vegetation (plant richness) and landscape variables help to understand ant diversity in a Eucalyptus-dominated landscape. This reaffirms the importance of preserving the vegetation and their associate fauna in Campos Murundus by increasing the extent of conservation of this threatened biome.

AB  - Recently, human activities have impacted biodiversity-rich forest in western Rwanda, creating a need to enhance restoration activities of degraded lands in the region. To evaluate the effects of reforestation activities on the community composition of soil-litter ants, research was conducted in Gishwati tropical montane forest, located in northern-western part of Rwanda. The ant fauna was studied in reforested lands dominated by regenerated native species and exotic tree species. Further, a primary forest made of native trees served as a reference. In each forest type, nine sampling points were used to sample ants. Ant specimens were collected using pitfalls, hand sampling and Winkler extractor. They were identified to subfamilies, genus and species levels using dichotomous keys, and also statistically analysed for species richness, diversity, evenness and community composition. We collected a total of 2,481 individuals from 5 subfamilies, 18 genera and 35 species. Higher abundance, diversity and species richness were found in soil-litter under natural primary and secondary forests dominated by regenerated native plant species compared to exotic tree forest. The ant community composition analysis indicated higher similarities in ant species sampled under primary native forest and secondary forest dominated by regenerated native species. Reforestation by regenerating native species may be given priority in restoration of degraded lands due to their importance in species richness and species diversity.

AB  - Old-growth forests play essential roles in maintaining biodiversity and providing ecosystem services. While heterogeneity produced by various natural disturbances and micro-topography is an integral part of old-growth forest ecosystems, the effects of such natural disturbances and heterogeneity on arthropod diversity in oldgrowth forests are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated how the heterogeneity produced by treefalls, landslides, and streams influences ground beetle diversity in an old-growth beech forest in the Tadami Biosphere Reserve, Japan. Fourteen plots composed of five forest interior, three treefall gaps, three landslides, and three along a stream were established, with 15 pitfall traps installed in each plot. Traps were opened for two days in each season. The results showed that canopy openness was the highest in landslide gaps, whereas litter depth was the lowest along the stream. Species richness was lowest along the stream but was similarly high in the other three habitat types. The activity density of beetles was also lowest along the stream, but highest in the landslide gaps. Landslide gaps and streams had distinct species compositions and several indicator species, respectively, indicating that soil disturbances involved in landslides and repeated overflow by snowmelt and heavy rain along the stream provide specific environmental conditions that differ from the forest interior and treefall gaps. This study demonstrates that heterogeneity derived from natural disturbances and streams enhances biodiversity in old-growth forests. These findings can be used to develop management measures that mimic natural disturbances in order to conserve biodiversity in managed forests.

AB  - Simple Summary Vegetable crops are grown in Nigeria for their edible fruits, leaves, and succulent shoots and roots. The vegetables include okra, tomatoes, chilli peppers, cucumbers, green amaranth, carrots and onions. Insect pest infestations and damages to these crops can greatly limit their availability for human consumption if unchecked. The insect pests include foliage beetles, caterpillars, aphids, fruit flies, stink bugs, and grasshoppers. Vegetable growers have many different chemical and non-chemical methods that can be used to mitigate insect damage to vegetable crops including the application of synthetic insecticides, modification of cultural practices, use of resistant varieties, application of botanicals and conservation practices for natural enemies of the insect pests, and these are presented in this review. By combining as many pest management tools as practicable, the insect pest problems of vegetables in Nigeria can be reasonably managed in a sustainable manner. Insect pest infestations and damage can limit the production of vegetables in the farming systems in Nigeria. This review looks at integrated insect pest management as a possible panacea for resolving insect pest issues in vegetable crops. The main vegetable crops which include okra, tomatoes, chilli peppers, cucumbers, green amaranth, carrots and onions are highlighted. The major insect pests of the various vegetables which include foliage beetles, caterpillars, aphids, fruit flies, stink bugs, and grasshoppers are also mentioned. The various control measures that have been empirically verified for the mitigation of the impact of these insect pests, including the application of synthetic insecticides, modification of agronomic practices, use of resistant varieties, application of botanicals, biological and mechanical controls, are discussed. Studies which have been carried out attempting to integrate two or more of the control strategies for better insect pest control are also reviewed. Strategies that can be put in place for the integrated pest management of vegetable insect pests in Nigeria are considered. Among the IPM (Integrated Pest Management) practices instituted for the mitigation of pest infestations on vegetable crops in Nigeria, intercropping of suitable vegetables in combination with the application of aqueous extracts of Azadirachta indica and Piper guineense seeds under good farm hygiene and sanitation proved to be most successful.

AB  - The increasing microplastics (MPs) pollution and continuous acid rain coincide in many areas of the world. However, how MPs interact with acid rain is still unclear. Herein, we conducted a microcosm experiment to decipher the combined effect of polyethylene (PE) MPs (1%, 5%, and 10%) and acid rain (pH 4.0) on the agricultural soil ecosystem of Southern China, in which edaphic property, microbial community, enzymatic activity and CO2 emission were investigated. The results showed that PE MPs significantly decreased soil water retention and nitrate nitrogen content regardless of acid rain. Soil total nitrogen significantly decreased under the co-exposure of 10% PE MPs and acid rain. However, PE MPs did not alter soil microbial biomass, i.e., the content of microbial biomass carbon, total phospholipid fatty acids, with or without acid rain. 10% PE MPs and acid rain treatment significantly increased the activity of catalase and soil CO2 emission. PE MPs addition did not affect the temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil CO2 emission regardless of acid rain. These findings suggest that MPs may interact with acid rain to affect soil ecosystems, thus underscoring the necessity to consider the interaction between MPs and ambient environmental factors when exploring the impact of MPs on the soil biodiversity and function.

AB  - Transformative change is required to achieve conservation of the globe's natural resources. Ambitious forest restoration can help achieve this change. Restoration success depends on trees persisting through multiple stressors, with drought standing out as one of utmost importance. However, research tends to focus on tree inciting factors of tree decline, like drought, whilst ignoring the fundamental importance of context, potentially leading to the wasted restoration effort. Indeed, the propensity of trees to succumb to, or resist, drought depends on whether they are predisposed to fail or succeed. Here, I argue that this predisposition crucially depends on the nature and characteristics of the former land use at the restoration site and propose a research agenda that will help enable the successful upscaling of forest restoration ambitions by revealing the land-use history-determined conditions under which tree species are likely to succeed in an era of environmental challenges.

AB  - We assessed the diversity and composition of fungal communities in different functional tissues and the rhizosphere soil of Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies stands along the latitudinal gradient of these tree species distributions in Europe to model possible changes in fungal communities imposed by climate change. For each tree species, living needles, shoots, roots, and the rhizosphere soil were sampled and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that the latitude and the host tree species had a limited effect on the diversity and composition of fungal communities, which were largely explained by the environmental variables of each site and the substrate they colonize. The mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation had a strong effect on root fungal communities, isothermality on needle fungal communities, mean temperature of the warmest quarter and precipitation of the driest month on shoot fungal communities, and precipitation seasonality on soil fungal communities. Fungal communities of both tree species are predicted to shift to habitats with a lower annual temperature amplitude and with increasing precipitation during the driest month, but the suitability of these habitats as compared to the present conditions is predicted to decrease in the future.

AB  - Little is known about the bioaccumulation and trophic transfer of total mercury (THg) and methyl-mercury (MeHg) via food webs in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in subtropical forest ecosystems. In the present study, THg and MeHg were determined as well as the carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope composition in samples of soils, plants, invertebrates, and songbird feathers to construct food webs in a remote subtropical montane forest in Mt. Ailao, southwest China and assess the bioaccumulation, biomagnification, and trophic transfer of Hg. Results showed that the trophic levels (TLs) of all consumers ranged from 0.8 to 3.3 and followed the order of songbirds > spiders > omnivorous insects > herbivorous insects > plants, and THg and MeHg exhibited a clear biomagnification up the food chain from plants-herbivorous/omnivorous insects-spiders-songbirds. The lowest MeHg concentration was observed in pine needles ranged from 0.104 to 0.949 ng g(-1) with only a 1.6% ratio of MeHg to THg (MeHg%), while the highest MeHg concentrations ranged from 425 to 5272 ng g(-1) in songbirds with MeHg% values of up to 96%. High values of trophic magnification slope (TMS) for THg (0.22) and MeHg (0.38) were observed in plant-invertebrate-songbird food chain, verifying the significant bioaccumulation of Hg, particularly MeHg, in the remote subtropical forest ecosystem. This study confirmed the production and efficient biomagnification of MeHg in remote subtropical montane forest and the significant bioaccumulation of MeHg in terrestrial top predators.

AB  - The Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) is an ecological security shelter for southeastern China and East Asia. It is necessary to develop scientific land-use management strategies in the Three-River Headwaters Region to achieve the goal of sustainable land development. This study selected six vital ecosystem services (ESs) for the study area namely, water supply, carbon sequestration, soil retention, sand fixation, hydrological regulation, and flood mitigation to quantify and map the spatiotemporal distributions of these ecosystem services during 2000-2018. We also mapped the spatial distribution of biodiversity protection importance in the Three-River Headwaters Region using the MaxEnt model. We further identified the priority conservation areas through the combination of biodiversity and six ecosystem services with different area thresholds and compared the conservation efficiencies in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and the current protected areas in the Three-River Headwaters Region. In addition, we evaluated the relationships between ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance and the impacts of eleven environmental factors (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index, elevation, slope, temperature, precipitation; wind speed, solar radiation, the proportion of forest land, the proportion of grassland, the proportion of cropland, and the proportion of wetland) on them. Finally, we identified the functional zones based on the ecosystem services-biodiversity bundles and proposed the corresponding management schemes. The results showed that the spatial distributions of six ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance in the Three-River Headwaters Region were not spatially congruent. With the changes in the area thresholds in extracting priority conservation areas, the protection focus in the Sanjiangyuan National Park and the current protected areas should be updated accordingly. We identified eight ecosystem services-biodiversity bundles in the Three-River Headwaters Region and divided them into five ecological functional zones, based on which then the corresponding zoning optimization management schemes in each bundle and function zone were proposed. Comprehensive consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity protection importance is insightful for other regions to conserve biodiversity and exploit natural resources simultaneously.

AB  - It is already well known that the effects of tree diversity on aboveground wood productivity depend on tree species identity and site conditions and thus can vary among different tree mixtures and forest sites. The effects of species diversity, specifically on belowground productivity and dynamics, have rarely been studied, so po-tential interactions with species identity and/or site conditions are largely unknown.Sequential soil coring was applied in mature pure and mixed stands of European beech, Norway spruce, and Douglas-fir in two regions of northern Germany to investigate the potential site, species, and mixing effects on fine root productivity, mortality, and turnover rates. In these ecologically and economically important species mixtures, a strong effect of site conditions on all fine root variables was found. In particular, more fine root growth was observed at the less favorable site conditions than at the more favorable ones. Species identity and interaction between site conditions and species identity were additional explanatory factors, whereat beech showed the strongest effect by site conditions. No overyielding was observed when fine root productivity was plotted against area potentially available (APA), nor were mortality or turnover. However, at specific soil depths, a mixing effect, caused mainly by beech, was observed for all variables and for both species mixtures.This study suggests that site conditions and species identity rather than species mixture are essential in explaining fine root dynamics and that increasing tree species diversity may not guarantee higher belowground productivity. However, in the face of climate change and the demand for wood as a natural and renewable resource, an admixture of Douglas-fir to pure European beech stands seems to be a reasonable alternative to an admixture of spruce, a species that is already seriously suffering by drought and bark beetle attacks.

AB  - Compared to most other forest ecosystems, circumpolar boreal and subarctic forests have few tree species, and are prone to mass outbreaks of herbivorous insects. A short growing season with long days allows rapid plant growth, which will be stimulated by predicted warming of polar areas. Emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) from soil and vegetation could be substantial on sunny and warm days and biotic stress may accelerate emission rates. In the atmosphere, BVOCs are involved in various gas-phase chemical reactions within and above forest canopies. Importantly, the oxidation of BVOCs leads to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. SOA particles scatter and absorb solar radiation and grow to form cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and participate in cloud formation. Through BVOC and moisture release and SOA formation and condensation processes, vegetation has the capacity to affect the abiotic environment at the ecosystem scale. Recent BVOC literature indicates that both temperature and herbivory have a major impact on BVOC emissions released by woody species. Boreal conifer forest is the largest terrestrial biome and could be one of the largest sources of biogenic mono- and sesquiterpene emissions due to the capacity of conifer trees to store terpene-rich resins in resin canals above and belowground. Elevated temperature promotes increased diffusion of BVOCs from resin stores. Moreover, insect damage can break resin canals in needles, bark, and xylem and cause distinctive bursts of BVOCs during outbreaks. In the subarctic, mountain birch forests have cyclic outbreaks of Geometrid moths. During outbreaks, trees are often completely defoliated leading to an absence of BVOC-emitting foliage. However, in the years following an outbreak there is extended shoot growth, a greater number of leaves, and greater density of glandular trichomes that store BVOCs. This can lead to a delayed chemical defense response resulting in the highest BVOC emission rates from subarctic forest in the 1-3 years after an insect outbreak. Climate change is expected to increase insect outbreaks at high latitudes due to warmer seasons and arrivals of invasive herbivore species. Increased BVOC emission will affect tropospheric ozone (O-3) formation and O-3 induced oxidation of BVOCs. Herbivore-induced BVOC emissions from deciduous and coniferous trees are also likely to increase the formation rate of SOA and further growth of the particles in the atmosphere. Field experiments measuring the BVOC emission rates, SOA formation rate and particle concentrations within and above the herbivore attacked forest stands are still urgently needed.

AB  - Agriculture is known to strongly influence soil functioning. Nevertheless, its long-term effects remain not well documented in the Mediterranean region, which has a long history of human land use. The "Parc Naturel Regional du Luberon" is a good illustration of these land use changes, as its territory is now covered with forests of differing ages and histories. This study investigates the effect of past land use (agricultural terraces) on microarthropods of current forest soils. In this way, Acari and Collembola of soils from ancient forests, recent forests (developed before 1958), and very recent forests (developed after 1958) were analysed. Different pedoclimatic conditions (Meso-Mediterranean vs. Supra-Mediterranean) and two contrasted seasons (winter and summer) were taken into account in mesofauna responses. A negative effect of past agricultural land use was observed on soil microarthropod abundance in very recent forests only, whatever the pedoclimatic conditions. After at least 60 years of reforestation, this negative effect was no longer observed, indicating a recovery of these communities. Land use legacy effect on oribatid mites in post-agricultural forests depended on the pedoclimatic conditions considered, suggesting that the recovery of microarthropod communities takes more time under more arid conditions. Microarthropods can be considered as good bioindicators of past land use effects depending on pedoclimatic conditions in forest soils.

AB  - As compared to temperate and boreal forests, the majority of tropical forests are biodiverse, structurally-complex and high-functioning ecosystems, yet their potential attributes are vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances and environmental factors. Here, we hypothesize that the biological, structural and functional attributes of tropical forests respond to water-related climatic and soil nutrient-related factors. Thus, we quantified 27 forest attributes and 20 environmental factors across 189 plots of Sri Lankan tropical forests. Our results suggest that environ-mental conditions were characterized by both water-related and temperature-related factors, and as such, both coarse-textured and compacted-structured soils determined soil conditions. Forest conditions were characterized by high species-functional diversity, structural complexity and aboveground biomass-related functions. We found strong positive effects of water-related climatic factors (particularly mean annual precipitation) followed by temperature-related climatic factors (i.e., growing degree days) but negligible positive to negative effects of textured-related (i.e., gravel contents) and nutrient-related (i.e., bulk density) soil factors on most of the bio-logical, structural and functional attributes. Overall the biodiversity and carbon stocks of Sri Lankan tropical forests are likely to increase with water-energy balance and improved soil conditions, and thus, studied forests could offset a substantial quantity of anthropogenic carbon emissions to achieve carbon neutrality which can have both regional and global significance if protected from anthropogenic disturbances. Broadly, this study suggests that conservation practices should consider multiple environmental and biotic attributes of the tropical forests during forest management which can have a win-win situation for biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

AB  - Tropical forests provide important ecosystem services and biodiversity for the world. With human activities and economic growth, tropical forests are becoming the primary sources of new plantations, making tropical regions hotspots of ecosystem service degenerations and biodiversity losses. Understanding the driving forces of ecological consequences is the key to local sustainable development and human well-being improvements. Therefore, we spatially quantified the changes in ecosystem services in tropical China in the past twenty years by remote sensing and InVEST model. The driving forces were further investigated by using Geodetector. We found that: 1) in the past twenty years, the area of evergreen broad-leaved forests, coniferous forests, and rubber forests have increased by 13.01%, 43.39%, and 101.23%, respectively. The shrublands and agricultural lands are the major contributors to these increased areas; 2) with the area increasing of forests, carbon storage and soil retention have increased by 9.40% and 0.30%, while nitrogen export and water yield have decreased by 43.30%, and 12.27%. This pattern of increase in carbon storage and soil retention was found in the highlands, while not in the lowlands, where large areas of evergreen broad-leaved forests have been converted to rubber forests; 3) NDVI was highly correlated to the carbon storage (q value = 0.201) and nitrogen export (q value = 0.109), while slope and precipitation mainly affected the soil retention (q value = 0.253) and water yield (q value = 0.073), respectively. This study provides a reference for ecological protection and management in tropical China.

AB  - Selective logging is one of the main human activities that are drastically modifying tropical forests around the world. Reduced-impact logging emerged as a rational model of timber harvesting that reduces the impacts on the ecosystems and contributes to the conservation of natural resources. Nevertheless, this type of activity may still alter the forest structure, nutrient cycling, soil drainage, and other important ecosystem processes. Here, we aimed at testing the effects of selective logging on litter deposition in central Brazilian Amazonia. We estimated litter production during one dry and one rainy season in 11 sites logged between 2003 and 2017 and one unlogged site. Mean litter deposition was greater during the dry season. Although litter deposition rates varied between a few study sites, this variation was independent of the time after logging. The results suggest that the low logging intensity in the study site (16.8 m(3)/ ha) had no intense impacts on litter deposition. Reduced-impact logging may be an alternative for the use of forest resources in Amazonian forests without compromising nutrient cycles.

AB  - Extreme events such as hurricanes repeatedly affect coastal areas in several tropical regions of the world. The economic and biodiversity losses caused by these extreme events are considerable. Mexico's coasts are exposed to hurricanes annually. A hydrological characterization and regionalization of the storms caused by the rain fields generated by all the hurricanes that touched the Mexican coast from 1966 to 2017 were carried out. Adimensional Huff curves are proposed to get precipitation hyetograms from which the erosion factor of a storm is obtained, using the universal soil loss equation (USLE). The results made it possible to get the typical precipitation hyetograms in the forests and protected areas before, during, and after the impact of a hurricane. The proposed hydrological regionalization made it possible to estimate the rainfall intensity in 30 min to characterize the start of rain erosion. The method proposed in this research was applied in the 177 natural protected areas (25,628,239 ha) as well as in the 370 voluntarily designated areas for conservation (399,643 ha) in Mexico. It is concluded that, with the regionalization and the proposed equations, it is possible to get typical hurricane precipitation hyetograms, which would allow us to detail the forest management plans in forests, ecological reserves, and protected areas of Mexico.

AB  - Soil organic nitrogen (N) cycling processes constitute a bottleneck of soil N cycling, yet little is known about how tree species composition may influence these rates, and even less under changes in soil water availability such as those that are being induced by climate change. In this study, we used a 12-year-old tree biodiversity experiment in southwestern France to assess the interactive effects of soil water availability (half of the blocks seasonally irrigated to double precipitation) and tree species composition (monocultural vs. mixed plots of coniferous Pinus pinaster, and of broadleaf Betula pendula). We measured gross protein depolymerisation rates using a novel high-throughput isotope pool dilution method, along with soil microbial biomass carbon and N to calculate microbial biomass-specific activities of soil organic N processes. Overall, high soil water availability led to a 42% increase in soil protein depolymerisation rates compared to the unirrigated plots, but we found no effect of species composition on these soil organic N cycling processes. When investigating the interactive effect of tree species mixing and soil water availability, the results suggest that mixing tree species had a negative effect on soil organic N cycling processes in the non-irrigated blocks subject to dry summers, but that this effect tended to become positive at higher soil water availability in irrigated plots. These results put forth that soil water availability could influence potential tree species mixing effects on soil organic N cycling processes in dry conditions. HighlightsTree species (with different litter C:N ratios) had little effect on protein depolymerisationIncreasing water availability via irrigation accelerated depolymerisation ratesNo interactive effect between tree species mixing and water availability, although trends emergedPositive trend of mixing under high water availability and negative trend under low water

AB  - Wildfires have complex impacts on forests, including changes in vegetation, threats to biodiversity, and emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which exacerbate climate change. The influence of wildfires on animal habitats is particularly noteworthy, as they can lead to significant changes in native environments. The extent of these alterations in species and habitats plays a crucial role in shaping forest ecology. Drought, disease, insect infestations, overgrazing, or their combined effects can amplify the negative effects on specific plant genera and entire ecosystems. In addition to the immediate consequences of plant mortality and altered community dynamics, forest fires have far-reaching implications. They often increase flowering and seed production, further influencing ecological communities. However, one concerning trend is the decline in the diversity of forest biological species within fire-affected areas. Beyond their ecological impacts, wildfires emit substantial quantities of greenhouse gases and fine particulates into the atmosphere, triggering profound changes in climate patterns and contributing to global warming. As vegetation burns during these fires, the carbon stored within is released, rendering large forest fires detrimental to biodiversity and the emission of CO2, a significant contributor to global warming. Measuring the global impact of wildfires on ecological communities and greenhouse gas emissions has become increasingly vital. These research endeavors shed light on the intricate relationships and feedback loops linking wildfires, ecosystem inhabitants, and the evolving climate landscape.

AB  - Land use change is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss, mostly due to habitat change and fragmentation. Belowground fungal diversity is very important in terrestrial ecosystems, however, the effect of land use change on soil fungal community is poorly understood. In this review, a total of 190 studies worldwide were analyzed. To monitor the effect of land use change, different fungal parameters such as richness, diversity, community composition, root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, spore density, ergosterol, and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) content and AM fungal glomalin related soil protein (GRSP) were studied. In general, results from analyzed studies often showed a negative response of fungal quantitative parameters after land use change from less-intensive site management to intensive site management. Land use change mostly showed significant shifts in fungal community composition. Considering land use change types, only 18 out of 91 land use change types were included in more than 10 studies, conversion of primary and secondary forest to various, more intensive land use was most often represented. All these 18 types of land use change influenced fungal community composition, however, the effects on quantitative parameters were mostly inconsistent. Current knowledge is not sufficient to conclude general land use impacts on soil fungi as the reviewed studies are fragmented and limited by the local context of land use change. Unification of the methodology, detailed descriptions of environmental factors, more reference sequences in public databases, and especially data on ecology and quantitative parameters of key fungal species would significantly improve the understanding of this issue.

AB  - The exploitation of non-timber forest products has been proposed as a sustainable way to exploit tropical forests, but such an opportunity remains to be proved. Here, we examine the impact of intensive acai palm (Euterpe oleracea) management on the seed rain and soil seed bank in an estuarine forest landscape with a long history of forest management by locals in the Amazon region. Seed rain (100 80 cm(2) collectors) and soil seed bank (100 30 cm(2) samples) were monitored through a year across 20 forest stands, covering a gradient of acai stem density (50-3575 acai stems per ha). Seed rain and bank were dominated by acai seeds (85.5%-85.8%) and by excluding them, seed rain and bank were low density and species poor, capturing a tiny subset from the local (17.91%-19.40%) and landscape woody flora (11.82%-14.55%). Moreover, autochthonous and vertebrated-dispersed predominated as well as those from tree species considered useful by locals. Overall, acai stem density positively affected acai seed abundance in the seed rain and negatively affected seed pools in the bank in relation to abundance of seeds and vertebrated dispersed, while adult tree species richness and density and accessibility to forest stands were associated with more diversified seed pools. Thereby, forest stands are exposed to different levels of acai management (high vs. low intensity) supported taxonomically distinct seed pools. Our results suggest that acai intensification disturbs seed rain and soil seed bank with potential impacts on forest regeneration and the forest integrity standards required to consider acai fruit production as sustainable according to current legislation.

AB  - Intensively managed monoculture plantations are increasingly replacing natural forests across the tropics resulting in changes in ecological niches of species and communities, and in ecosystem functioning. Collembola are among the most abundant arthropods inhabiting the belowground system sensitively responding to changes in vegetation and soil conditions. However, most studies on the response of Collembola to land-use change were conducted in temperate ecosystems and focused on shifts in community composition or morphological traits, while parameters more closely linked to ecosystem functioning, such as trophic niches, received little attention. Here, we used stable isotope analysis (C-13 and N-15) to investigate changes in the trophic structure and use of food resources by Collembola in Jambi province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region that experienced strong deforestation in the last decades. Isotopic values of Collembola from 32 sites representing four land-use systems were analyzed (rainforest, rubber agroforest, rubber (Hevea brasiliansis) and oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) monoculture plantations). Across Collembola species Delta C-13 values were highest in rainforest suggesting more pronounced processing of litter resources by microorganisms and consumption of these microorganisms by Collembola in this system. Lower Delta C-13 values, but high Delta C-13 variation in Collembola in oil palm plantations indicated that Collembola shifted towards herbivory and used more variable resources in this system. Small range in Delta N-15 values in Collembola species in monoculture plantations in comparison to rainforest indicated that conversion of rainforest into plantations is associated with simplification in the trophic structure of Collembola communities. This was further confirmed by generally lower isotopic niche differentiation among species in plantations. Across the studied ecosystems, atmobiotic species (Symphypleona and Paronellidae) occupied the lowest, whereas euedaphic Collembola species occupied the highest trophic position, resembling patterns in temperate forests. Some species of Paronellidae in rainforest and jungle rubber had Delta N-15 values below those of leaf litter suggesting algivory (Salina sp.1, Callyntrura sp.1 and Lepidonella sp.1), while a dominant species, Pseudosinella sp.1, had the highest Delta N-15 values in most of the land-use systems suggesting that this species at least in part lives as predator or scavenger. Overall, the results suggest that rainforest conversion into plantation systems is associated with marked shifts in the structure of trophic niches in soil and litter Collembola with potential consequences for ecosystem functioning and food-web stability.

AB  - Worldwide, forestry must face several challenges during the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. The decline of biodiversity and ecosystem services, ongoing deforestation, climate change, and biological invasions must be mitigated with forest restoration and by applying sustainable forest management. Experiences with the integration of non-native tree species into forest management in many parts of the world show benefits but also trade-offs regarding sustainability. In Central Europe, Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco], originating from Northern America, has been introduced by forestry and managed for more than one and a half centuries. Growth characteristics, drought tolerance, and timber quality are major reasons which make this tree species attractive for forestry and wood industry. Whether Douglas fir might be invasive with potential trade-offs regarding biodiversity, uncontrolled regeneration, and spread is not yet fully understood and controversially debated. We investigated the regeneration of Douglas fir in the Spessart mountains, a vast woodland in south-western Germany which has a considerable cover of anthropogenic coniferous afforestations. We sampled the regeneration of Douglas fir by differentiating height growth classes in various forest-stand types, taking the distance from mature mother trees, abiotic site conditions (e.g., water balance and soil properties), light supply, forest-stand characteristics, ground vegetation, and browsing pressure into account. Also integrating the individual regeneration of the accompanying tree species, we applied multivariate analyses. Most of our investigated variables did not show a significant correlation with Douglas fir regeneration. However, results point to a positive relationship of spontaneous Douglas fir regeneration at moist and light sites as well as in close distance to potential seed trees. The analysis of the current invasion potential did not reveal a major risk under the given site conditions in the study area.

AB  - Forest provides services, directly linked to micro and macro environment, water and soil resources, plants and animals' diversity, food production and security and energy resources. This study contributes to other studies and growing literature on climate change impacts and adaptation strategies in the Congo Basin forest, particularly Cameroon's forest region. Mambioko has a four-season climate, with annual precipitation of 2000-3000 mm and temperature variations of 21.8-30.8 degrees C, most of its agriculture is rainfed. It has an evergreen or semi-deciduous rainforest corresponds to the ""humid"" and "low- and medium-altitude sub-humid" eco-floristic zones. This study is carried out to identify and assess climate change impacts on the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities in Mambioko community forest in Cameroon. Primary data were collected from 85 households; key informants, and focus group discussions and were supplemented with secondary data from a desk review of relevant literature. The study shows that climate change impacts the major livelihood activities of forest-dependent communities through prolonged drought, erratic rainfall patterns, and variability in rainfall intensity. Four of the critical activities of local communities impacted by climate change are agriculture, hunting, fishing and collecting non-timber forest products. People respond to the negative impacts by adopting simple irrigation systems, crop diversification, alternative livelihood activities, and increasing their farm sizes. This study concludes that future interventions to help forest-dependent communities cope with climate change impacts will require pursuing alternative non-climate-dependent livelihood activities, increasing access to climate information, and adopting sustainable agricultural and forest management practices.

AB  - Insect herbivory on seedling leaves is one of the most important factors driving seedling growth and mortality in natural forests, which sets the pivotal roles of insect herbivory in affecting natural forest regeneration and species composition. The intensity of herbivory can be influenced by multiple biotic and abiotic factors affecting leaf detection or consumption by insect herbivores. However, the relative importance of these biotic and abiotic factors in affecting insect herbivory and their interactions remain largely unknown in species-rich forests. We measured insect herbivory on seedling young leaves across 600 1 m x 1 m seedling plots in a subtropical forest. Effects of nine seedling traits, neighboring plant compositions, soil moisture, and light availability on young leaf damage by insect herbivores were assessed with generalized linear mixed-effects models. We found that seedling traits associated with plant size (young leaf area and seedling height), leaf nutrition or defense (leaf thickness, carbon content, and stem specific length) explained more of the variation in insect herbivory than the biotic and abiotic environmental factors. Young leaf coloration (delayed greening degree) exhibited contrasting effects on leaf damage at wet vs. dry sites, so did seedling trait diversity (functional dispersion, FDis). The risk of insect herbivory increased with leaf redness and decreased with seedling FDis at wet sites, while the opposite trends were observed at dry sites. Our study advances the understanding on the driving factors of insect herbivory on seedling leaves in species-rich forests and suggests that the alleviating effects of plant diversity on insect herbivory were stronger at wet conditions.

AB  - Assessing ecosystem services supply is an efficient way to facilitate ecosystem management, but there is no clear way to link ecosystem services to sustainable management decision-making. This study links sustainable supply of ecosystem services to sustainable management goals to evaluate the conservation value of dry forests. Hence, 11 ecosystem services (water yield, timber production, fruit production, carbon sequestration, soil retention, pollination, aesthetic, tourism, heritage, soil organic matter and habitat provision) were quantified in three dry forest communities. Evergreen forest communities were more successful in supplying ecosystem services than other ones. Pearson correlation analysis showed that water yield and carbon sequestration had a trade-off relationship with pollination (P < 0.001). Total ecosystem services of plant communities were estimated by considering both trade-off and synergy relationships between ecosystem services. Precipitation (R-2 = 0.465) and leaf lifespan (R-2 = 0.422) were the main ecological drivers of ecosystem services based on Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Criteria importance through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) showed that water yield and carbon sequestration services had the highest weights for sustainable management. Maximizing economic and social benefits was also the most important sustainable management criterion. The importance of plant communities for conservation was determined by integrating the relative importance of ecosystems for sustainable supply of services and the importance of services for sustainable management. The comprehensive approach presented in this study not only ecologically contributes to the ecosystem health and supports the sustainable supply of ESs, but also meets other goals of sustainable management and supports management decision-making towards optimization of sustainable supply of ESs.

AB  - The concept of sustainable livelihood garnered a prominent status in humanitarian and international development organizations that aim to calculate and build a livelihood for agroforestry farmers. However, it is difficult to measure and analyze as well as visualize the data of livelihood improvement from agroforestry (AF). This paper comparatively assessed 400 smallholder farmers' livelihood through AF and conventional farming (CF) systems in the Northern Irrigated Plain of Pakistan. The findings showed that AF has a mixed impact on farmers' livelihood capital, including human, physical, natural, financial and social capital. Specifically, AF significantly improved financial capital in terms of timber, non-timber and fuel wood income. Furthermore, the physical capital (buffalo plough, generators and sprinklers), natural capital (the extent of cultivated land and land ownership; the number of households (HHs) growing vegetables, fruit crops and medicinal crops) and social capital (the number of social groups that HHs involved and number of HHs sharing crop seeds) of AF farmer HHs were significantly improved compared to those of CF farmers. However, the results show that financial capital gain through crop income, HHs owning high-value vehicles (tractors) and farmers trust and collective activities were significantly higher in CF farmers than AF ones. Therefore, to enhance the contribution of AF to rural livelihood, advanced extension services and government involvement on research planning and implementing are needed.

AB  - Ants and termites reach high abundances in the tropics and substantially affect the environment through a range of their activities. Because of foraging and decomposition of organic matter at their nesting sites, these locations show fundamentally altered soil properties compared to the adjacent soil. However, such changes are typically studied only within one species or taxon and in one habitat type. Consequently, it is not clear how these effects vary across different taxa and in relation to anthropogenic habitat change. In this study we assess the impacts of different mound-building taxa across a gradient of tropical habitat change in SE Asia comprising primary forest, logged forest and oil palm plantation. To do this we analysed chemical soil properties of mounds of multiple taxa of social insects, with some taxa spanning the full habitat change gradient, and where taxa differ in their mound construction type. Our results show that soils in mounds and adjacent soils have consistently different properties. However, these patterns differ both between social insect taxa and across habitat types. Specifically, mounds of soil-feeding termites Dicuspiditermes spp. were substantially enriched in basic soil nutrients such as C, N, P, especially in oil palm, while mounds of the leaf litter-feeding termite Macrotermes gilvus were depleted. Ant mounds did not show a clear pattern. This indicates that different social insect taxa in a particular habitat affect soil properties in differing ways, and furthermore that such impacts can change when a habitat is anthropo-genically altered. Our research highlights the importance of termites for driving the heterogeneity of soil properties and nutrient redistribution across tropical landscapes.

AB  - Precipitation and temperature in the subalpine region have increased dramatically in recent decades due to global warming, and human disturbances have continued to impact the vegetation in the region. Seed bank plays an important role in population recovery, but there are few studies on the synergistic effects of human disturbances and climate change on seed bank. We analyzed the synergistic effects of human disturbances and climate change on seed bank sam-ples from 20 sites in the subalpine coniferous forest region using grazing and logging as the disturbance intensity gradi-ent and precipitation and temperature as climate variables. The species diversity of aboveground vegetation all changed significantly (p < 0.05) with precipitation, temperature and disturbance level, while the seed bank richness and density did not. Furthermore, the species composition of the seed bank varied significantly less than that of the aboveground vegetation at different levels of disturbance (p < 0.001). Thus, seed bank showed a strong buffering capacity against the risk of local extinction caused by environmental changes that shift the species composition and diversity of above-ground vegetation. In addition, soil and litter are important influences controlling seed bank density in subalpine forests, and the results of structural equation modelling suggest that both disturbance and climate change can indirectly regulate the seed bank by changing the physicochemical properties of soil and litter. We conclude that increases in precipitation and temperature driven by climate change can buffer the negative effects of disturbances on the seed bank.

AB  - In searching of biological methods which can be included in the integrated management of the large pine weevil Hylobius abietis in the reforestations, the small- and large-scale field trials were carried out in 2014-2016 to evaluate the potential of using different species of entomopathogenic nematodes from the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis to reduce the damage and population of this pest. The experiments were conducted in 2014-2016 in central Poland on one year clearcuts with Pinus sylvestris L. stumps left after harvesting 90-110-year-old Scots pine stands. In the small-scale trials, the soil around the 30 stumps was sprayed with a suspension of Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser), S. feltiae (Filipjev), Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Poinar) and H. downesi Stock, Griffin and Burnell. In the large-scale trials, the treatments were carried out an the area of 1 ha, and the stumps were sprayed with S. carpocapsae and H. downesi. In all applications, the nematodes were applied at a dose of 3.5 million infective juveniles per stump. The roots of experimental stumps were collected 4 weeks after treatment. After the roots debarking, the large pine weevil larvae were isolated and the percentage of insects parasitized by nematodes were assessed. The results of small-scale treatments indicated low parasitism of H. abietis larvae (5-25%) by the applied nematodes. The highest mortality of H. abietis larvae (11-25%) was observed in the roots of P. sylvestris stumps treated with H. downesi. Large-scale applications of the nematodes S. carpocapsae and H. downesi resulted in parasitazion of up to 17% of H. abietis larvae developing in treated stumps. These applications did not affect the extent of damage caused by H. abietis beetles to P. sylvestris seedlings in the experimental plots. Presumably, the low level of H. abietis parasitism was influenced by the weather conditions unfavourable for nematode development, i.e., lack of precipitation leading to the decreased moisture of forest litter and soil. The results are discussed in the context of abiotic factors that may influence the effectiveness of nematode applications in reforested areas.

AB  - Amazonian rainforests, once thought to be pristine wilderness, are increasingly known to have been widely inhabited, modified, and managed prior to European arrival, by human populations with diverse cultural backgrounds. Amazonian Dark Earths (ADEs) are fertile soils found throughout the Amazon Basin, created by pre-Columbian societies with sedentary habits. Much is known about the chemistry of these soils, yet their zoology has been neglected. Hence, we characterized soil fertility, macroinvertebrate communities, and their activity at nine archeological sites in three Amazonian regions in ADEs and adjacent reference soils under native forest (young and old) and agricultural systems. We found 673 morphospecies and, despite similar richness in ADEs (385 spp.) and reference soils (399 spp.), we identified a tenacious pre-Columbian footprint, with 49% of morphospecies found exclusively in ADEs. Termite and total macroinvertebrate abundance were higher in reference soils, while soil fertility and macroinvertebrate activity were higher in the ADEs, and associated with larger earthworm quantities and biomass. We show that ADE habitats have a unique pool of species, but that modern land use of ADEs decreases their populations, diversity, and contributions to soil functioning. These findings support the idea that humans created and sustained high-fertility ecosystems that persist today, altering biodiversity patterns in Amazonia.

AB  - Warming temperatures are increasing rainfall extremes, yet arthropod responses to climatic fluctuations remain poorly understood. Here, we used spatiotemporal variation in tropical montane climate as a natural experiment to compare the importance of biotic versus abiotic drivers in regulating arthropod biomass. We combined intensive field data on arthropods, leaf phenology and in situ weather across a 1700-3100 m elevation and rainfall gradient, along with desiccation-resistance experiments and multi-decadal modelling. We found limited support for biotic drivers with weak increases in some herbivorous taxa on shrubs with new leaves, but no landscape-scale effects of leaf phenology, which tracked light and cloud cover. Instead, rainfall explained extensive interannual variability with maximum biomass at intermediate rainfall (130 mm month(-1)) as both 3 months of high and low rainfall reduced arthropods by half. Based on 50 years of regional rainfall, our dynamic arthropod model predicted shifts in the timing of biomass maxima within cloud forests before plant communities transition to seasonally deciduous dry forests (mean annual rainfall 1000-2500 mm vs. <800 mm). Rainfall magnitude was the primary driver, but during high solar insolation, the 'drying power of air' (VPDmax) reduced biomass within days contributing to drought related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Highlighting risks from drought, experiments demonstrated community-wide susceptibility to desiccation except for some caterpillars in which melanin-based coloration appeared to reduce the effects of evaporative drying. Overall, we provide multiple lines of evidence that several months of heavy rain or drought reduce arthropod biomass independently of deep-rooted plants with the potential to destabilize insectivore food webs.

AB  - Grasslands play a very important role in the water and carbon cycle of arid and semi-arid areas, where they are the main type of steppe globally. With this said, research into grassland ecological processes mostly consists of single-factor controlled experiments such as precipitation, temperature or grazing, and few studies have investigated the effects of synergistic interactions between multiple factors on grassland hydrological, soil and vegetation processes. In this study, we set up a prohibited grazing area in a typical area of the Xilingole Steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. Vegetation (species richness (SR), above-ground biomass (AGB), below-ground biomass (BGB), etc.), precipitation and the soil moisture of 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm depths were observed continuously from 2015 to 2018. The results indicate that the species number in areas where grazing is prohibited is higher than where it is grazed, and the number and species of dominant species changes with grazing prohibition time. The AGB and BGB of prohibited areas is higher than grazed areas, and the variance rate of AGB increased rapidly (20% and 45%) at the first 2 years and then stabilized (52% and 55%), but BGB's variance rate increased slowly from 12% to 20%. The soil moisture content in the study area is higher in the surface layer than in the deeper layers. In the grazing prohibition zone, the above ground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) were both significantly correlated with volumetric water content (VWC) at the 0.01 level. In grazing areas, there was no significant correlation between AGB and soil moisture, and the coefficient of determination between BGB and VWC was 0.6127 (p < 0.01). SR did not have a significant relationship with soil moisture but indirectly response to it through BGB, especially in prohibited site. These results are important for understanding water cycle processes, grazing management and address food security issues across steppe in arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - The response of plants to a warming climate could have a large feedback on further climatic change. This feedback is especially important for tropical forests, where the global peak in plant productivity and biodiversity occurs. Here we test the response of tropical forest tree seedling growth, photosynthesis and herbivory to 3 years of in situ full-soil profile warming. We studied six species, three of which are known nitrogen-fixers and we hypothesized that the warming response of growth will be mediated by nutrient availability to plants. Across species, growth was significantly lower in warmed soil compared to soil at ambient temperature, and the same pattern was observed for light-saturated photosynthesis, pointing toward a growth decline associated with decreased C fixation. Within species, the relative growth decline was significant for two species, Inga laurina and Tachigali versicolor, both of which are N-fixers. Together our results suggest a growth decline may have resulted from a negative effect of warming on N-fixation, rather than via changes in nutrient mineralization from soil organic matter, which was unchanged for N and increased for P during the dry-to-wet season transition. Overall, our study demonstrates that belowground warming causes species-specific declines in the growth and photosynthesis of seedlings, with a suggestion-requiring further investigation-that this growth decline is larger in N-fixing species.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Given the increase in infrastructure construction, ecological restoration techniques need to be scientifically assessed so that appropriate measures can be taken. However, the specific effects of these techniques are often confounded by multiple ecological stressors, and robust evaluations of their effects are rare. Here, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 68 peer-reviewed publications to quantitatively evaluate the ecological impacts of roadside slope restoration techniques and explored potential mechanisms using linear regression and random-forest models. We found that roadside slope restoration techniques generally enhanced restoration effectiveness, but the recovery rate differed over space and time. Relative to the degraded reference group, the synthetic technique (63.10%) and species selection (62.09%) had more positive impacts on restoring slopes than erosion control (44.82%), seed spraying (43.55%), and substrate amelioration (12.96%). Additionally, we found that vegetation condition, soil quality, and species diversity were negatively correlated with restoration time, implying that recovery might not be stable during early restoration periods. Our findings highlighted the importance of biodiversity for restoration success, but the negative relationship between species diversity, precipitation, and age highlighted the potential risks of losing biodiversity during restoration. Finally, the importance of soil substrate but difficulty in restoring it suggested that restoration actions should stress soil substrate amelioration. Generally, this study provides evidence-based references to support decision making and ensure the effectiveness and sustainability of future slope restoration efforts.

AB  - Ethiopia's forest fires are causing biodiversity loss and ecosystem destruction, highlighting the need for preventative measures. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the future impact of climate on forest fires in Ethiopia. Hence, this study primarily examines the past and future climate patterns and their potential impact on occurrence of wildfires. Climate data from the baseline (1980-2020) were projected for the future period (2021-2099) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios using R-software. The trends in climate were analysed using Anclim and Weather-Datatool software. To estimate the occurrence of fire, Keetch-Byram-Drought-Index was calculated using climate data and antecedent soil moisture. The result of the study indicates a projected increase in temperature, with variation in precipitation. A moderate fire risk is projected in 2021-2039 that increases to moderate-to-high probability in 2040-2069 and 2070-2099. In the future, the annual severity of fires will be 27.2-27.8% moderate and 3.3-7.8% high. The highest risk of fire will be experienced in the dry season, more in the 2070-2099 under RCP8.5 scenario. Based on the analysis this study concludes that climate change is expected to have an impact on the occurrence of wildfires. The study emphasizes the importance of taking proactive measures for effective fire management.

AB  - The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is focussing attention and resources on restoration globally. Nowhere is this more crucial than in tropical forests that harbor immense biodiversity, but have also undergone widespread defores-tation over the past few decades. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate how biodiversity features respond to for -est restoration across the Brazilian Atlantic Forest (BAF), one of the most threatened biodiversity hotspots in the world. We assembled biodiversity in different metrics of structure and diversity features of three taxonomic groups (vascular plants, soil microorganisms, and invertebrates), generating a dataset with 2370 observations from 76 primary studies. We quantified the incomplete recovery of biodiversity (i.e., the rate of recovery to a pre-disturbance state) occurring during the restoration process, which we called the 'recovery gap'. Our results revealed that forests undergoing resto-ration in the BAF show a recovery gap of 34% for structure features and 22% for diversity features in comparison to reference reforests, considering all taxonomic groups investigated. For vascular plants, soil microorganisms, andinvertebrates the recovery gap ranged between 46 and 47%, 16-26%, and 4-7%, respectively. Overall, the recovery gap was influenced by the interaction of restoration actions (i.e., the past land use, restoration age and restoration approach - active and passive restoration), however, structure features responded more sensitively to the time elapsed since restoration started, while the recovery gap for diversity features depended more on the past land-use. Our study can help guide the prioritization of the aforenamed taxonomic groups in restoration, the regulation of potential biodiversity offsetting policies in the BAF, and understanding how coupled biodiversity features respond to the interaction of environmental conditions and restoration actions in a high fragmented tropical landscape.

AB  - Monitoring the provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES) in social-ecological systems is a major challenge. Most tools usually tackle the problem by modelling individual ES, but do not perform a holistic analysis of a dynamic and integrated system. We developed a discrete-event model (DORIAN) and explored its potential for assessing biodiversity and multifunctionality of a mountain ski resort subjected to a changing climate. We represented this social-ecological system as a network comprising 16 binary components and 51 processes that define component interactions. We identified 22 economy- and ecology-related ES, depending on the presence/absence of components. We simulated six scenarios representing different economic, environmental and climatic situations and calculated a score (the sum of proxies for biodiversity or ES), corresponding to the level of biodiversity and multifunctionality. Results showed that climate change reduced the system's multifunctionality and increased the number of degraded states, as well as the trajectories from healthy to degraded states. With increasing levels of biodiversity, only ecology-related ES were boosted at low biodiversity levels, while both high levels of ecology- and economy-related ES were maintained at high biodiversity levels. This result demonstrates the importance of conserving high biodiversity in a social ecological system, for an optimal "biodiversity - multifunctionality" win-win strategy.

AB  - Along with habitat transformation, climate change has profound impacts on biodiversity and may alter ecosystem services on which human welfare depends. Many studies of the carbon cycle have focused on lowland tropical forests; however, upland forests have been less explored despite their pivotal role in carbon sequestration. Here, I synthesized the state of knowledge on the allocation of carbon in its different stocks (aboveground, belowground, and soil) as well as in its main fluxes (plant decomposition, respiration, and litterfall) in tropical upland ecosystems of the planet. In November 2020, a systematic review was carried out to identify references published from 2000 to 2020 through a combination of key terms in Google Scholar and Scopus databases, thus analysing bibliographic, geographical, methodological, and carbon cycling information of the global upland tropics (between 23.5 degrees N-23.5 degrees S). After analysing a total of 1967 references according to inclusion-exclusion criteria, 135 references published in the last 20 years were selected. Most of the studies were conducted in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest of South America. The main factors studied were elevation and forest type. Forest structure and soil variables were largely associated when studying carbon cycling in these ecosystems. Estimations of carbon stocks comprised three-fourths of the total studies, while the remaining fraction focused on carbon fluxes. Aboveground biomass and carbon in soils were highly investigated, while plant decomposition and respiration were the components that received the least attention. Even though in the last 20 years there was a slight increase in the number of studies on carbon cycle in tropical upland forests, I found bias associated with the biomes and ecoregions studied (especially in the Andes). Elevation was the main factor examined but other essential aspects such as the successional gradient, landscape management, diversity- productivity relationship, faunal and microbial effect, trophic cascades, and Gadgil effect require more attention. The inclusion of different litter species and origins (i.e. roots and stems) and theoretical frameworks including home-field advantage, substrate-matrix interaction, and phenology-substrate match may provide explanatory mechanisms to better understand litter decomposition over these forests. Despite respiration being a paramount link that is closely tied to above- and belowground compartment, this flux constitutes one of the important gaps to fulfil in future research. For a comprehensive understanding of the carbon cycle in upland forests, it is necessary to obtain information on its main fluxes and integrate them into climate change mitigation plans.

AB  - The soil nematode fauna of five locations situated in Parque Nacional del Agua (PNA) in Costa Rica is characterized and analyzed. Four ecosystems were sampled in each location: primary (undisturbed) forest, secondary (naturally regenerated) forests, tree plantations (cleared and replanted with timber trees), and pastures (cleared of trees). Five soil samples of 100 g were analyzed in each location and ecosystem, resulting in a total of 100 samples. One hundred and thirty-one nematode genera were identified, and their abundance and biomass were estimated and analyzed by means of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and redundancy analysis (RDA). The observed nematode abundance was 1237 +/- 520 specimens per soil sample for the whole survey, similar to previously reported from tropical soils. Dominance-diversity curves, based on nematode abundance, follow a similar 'hollow curve' pattern, with only 20 of the genera representing 84.6% of the total abundance, and only 12 of the genera representing 88% of the total biomass. Helicotylenchus, tylenchids, criconematids, Belondira, Longidorus, Xiphinema, Monotrichodorus, Prismatolaimus and Steinernema are important in the assemblages due their abundance or biomass in the different samples. Monotrichodorus and Discocriconemella appear related to undisturbed ecosystems, and they could have potential as disturbance indicators. Biomass-based dominance-diversity curves have similar qualitative and quantitative behavior to those observed in abundance distribution, but the dorylaims, Aporcelinus and Aporcelaimoides, which represented only the 0.35% of the abundance, having a major part of the total biomass (4.33%). NMDS analysis segregated locations into two groups, sampled sites were arranged according to the life zone where they belong. Ecosystems were segregated into natural ecosystems and plantations but having overlapping zones. Whereas RDA analysis indicated that organic matter and Cu are the most relevant edaphic variables for explaining the distribution of nematode assemblages, however few genera appear important in the ordination, Mesocriconema, Longidorus, Xiphinema and Belondira between them.

AB  - The richness of specialized herbivores and their host plants in a Brazilian dry forest was inventoried to evaluate if soil types and seasonality are important factors determining the composition of gall-inducing insects and their host plants in Caatinga environments on a local scale. This study recorded 12 different morphotypes of gall distributed among eight host species belonging to five botanical families. Both soils and seasonality influenced the number of species and individuals of host plant, and the richness of gall-inducing insect. The greatest richness of gall-inducing insects and their host plants was observed during the rainy season in the Caatinga vegetation on soils of sedimentary origin, which is considered to have low fertility as regards phosphorus content. Our results corroborate the hypothesis of soil fertility which predicts that the richness of gall-inducing insects will be higher on infertile soils and demonstrate the importance of substrate and seasonality for the richness of gall-inducing insects in Caatinga on a local scale.

AB  - Global increases in intensive forestry have raised concerns about forest plantation effects on water, but few studies have tested the effects of plantation forest removal and native forest restoration on catchment hydrology. We describe results of a 14-year paired watershed experiment on ecological restoration in south central Chile which documents streamflow response to the early stages of native forest restoration, after clearcutting of plantations of exotic fast-growing Eucalyptus, planting of native trees, and fostering natural regeneration of native temperate rainforest species. Precipitation, streamflow, and vegetation were measured starting in 2006 in four small (3 to 5 ha) catchments with Eucalyptus globulus plantations and native riparian buffers in the Valdivian Coastal Reserve. Mean annual precipitation is 2500 mm, of which 11% occurs in summer. Streamflow increased, and increases persisted, throughout the first 9 years of vigorous native forest regeneration (2011 to 2019). Annual streamflow increased by 40% to >100% in most years and >150% in fall and summer of some years. Streamflow was 50% to 100% lower than before treatment in two dry summers. Base flow increased by 28% to 87% during the restoration period compared to pre-treatment, and remained elevated in later years despite low summer precipitation. Overall, these findings indicate that removal of Eucalyptus plantations immediately increased streamflow, and native forest restoration gradually restored deep soil moisture reservoirs that sustain base flow during dry periods, increasing water ecosystem services. To our knowledge this is the first study to assess catchment streamflow response to native forest restoration in former forest plantations. Therefore, the results of this study are relevant to global efforts to restore native forest ecosystems on land currently intensively managed with fast-growing forest plantations and may inform policy and decision-making in areas experiencing a drying trend associated with climate change.

AB  - Collaborations between ecosystem ecologists and engineers have led to impressive progress in developing complex models of biogeochemical fluxes in response to global climate change. Ecology and engineering iteratively inform and transform each other in these efforts. Nested data streams from local sources, adjacent networks, and remote sensing sources together magnify the capacity of ecosystem ecologists to observe systems in near real-time and address questions at temporal and spatial scales that were previously unobtainable. We describe our research experiences working in a Costa Rican rainforest ecosystem with the challenges presented by constant high humidity, 4300 mm of annual rainfall, flooding, small invertebrates entering the tiniest openings, stinging insects, and venomous snakes. Over the past two decades, we faced multiple challenges and learned from our mistakes to develop a broad program of ecosystem research at multiple levels of integration. This program involved integrated networks of diverse sensors on a series of canopy towers linked to multiple belowground soil sensor arrays that could transport sensor data streams from the forest directly to an off-site location via a fiber optic cable. In our commentary, we highlight three components of our work: (1) the eddy flux measurements using canopy towers; (2) the soil sensor arrays for measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of CO2 and O(2 )fluxes at the soil-atmosphere interface; and (3) focused investigations of the ecosystem impact of leaf-cutter ants as "ecosystem engineers" on carbon fluxes.

AB  - Oil palm (OP) plantations are gradually replacing tropical rainforest in Malaysia, one of the largest palm oil producers globally. Conversion of lands to OP plantations has been associated with compositional shifts of the microbial community, with consequences on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While the impact of the change in land use has recently been investigated for microorganisms involved in N2O emission, the response of the aerobic methanotrophs to OP agriculture remains to be determined. Here, we monitored the bacterial community composition, focusing on the aerobic methanotrophs, in OP agricultural soils since 2012, 2006, and 1993, as well as in a tropical rainforest, in 2019 and 2020. High-affinity methane uptake was confirmed, showing significantly lower rates in the OP plantations than in the tropical rainforest, but values increased with continuous OP agriculture. The bacterial, including the methanotrophic community composition, was modified with ongoing OP agriculture. The methanotrophic community composition was predominantly composed of unclassified methanotrophs, with the canonical (Methylocystis) and putative methanotrophs thought to catalyze high-affinity methane oxidation present at higher relative abundance in the oldest OP plantation. Results suggest that the methanotrophic community was relatively more stable within each site, exhibiting less temporal variations than the total bacterial community. Uncharacteristically, a 16S rRNA gene-based co-occurrence network analysis revealed a more complex and connected community in the OP agricultural soil, which may influence the resilience of the bacterial community to disturbances. Overall, we provide a first insight into the ecology and role of the aerobic methanotrophs as a methane sink in OP agricultural soils.

AB  - Among all proxy archives, tree rings are highly promising indicator of ecological and environmental processes due to their high climatic sensitivity, better annual resolution, and large spatial coverage. Seasonal importance of soil moisture dynamics and impact of drought events on tree growth development and carbon sequestration potential in tropical moist forests was assessed using the teak tree ring width index and instrumental climate data from Aizawl, Mizoram. Present analysis suggests that soil moisture during months of the early growing season with low precipitation is crucial for determining the growth of teak trees in the Northeast region of India. Results of the present study reflected the impact of remote atmospheric climate regulation modes such as El Nin similar to oSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Sea surface temperature (SST) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) on site climate. Results indicate that the increasing moisture stresses in the region may cause the survival risk for the other forest vegetation having low adaptability to climate change stresses with the inability to make niche shifts. Increasing the number of tree ring studies linked with eco-physiological parameters of tree growth is recommended to better visualize the level of stresses on the trees in the moist tropical forests. This information will be useful in developing better management plans for biodiversity conservation in the tropical region.

AB  - Tropical forests are the world's most structurally complex ecosystems, providing key functions like biomass accumulation, which is linked to this complexity. Tropical forests are also exposed to chronic, non-severe winds, yet their effect on forest structural complexity is understudied. Here we examine drivers of forest structural complexity in Puerto Rico with a particular focus on chronic wind exposure. We used airborne light detection and ranging data collected in 2016 to quantify canopy height and rugosity (variation in height) in similar to 20,000, 0.28 ha forested sites stratified by forest age. We used random forest models to analyze variation in canopy height and rugosity as a function of chronic wind exposure, forest age, mean annual precipitation, elevation, slope (in degrees), soil type, soil available water storage, and exposure to a previous hurricane. Canopy height was driven by precipitation, forest age, and chronic wind exposure, decreasing by 2.12 m (16%) on average in wind-exposed forests across all forest ages. Canopy height increased by 4.0 m (41%) on average in forests aged 25-66 years, and by 4.0 m between sites with 1000 and 2000 mm y-1 precipitation. Canopy rugosity was driven by canopy height, precipitation, forest age, and elevation, increasing log-linearly with canopy height and precipitation, decreasing with elevation, and was highest in younger forests. Chronic wind exposure did not drive variation in canopy rugosity. Our results suggest that chronic wind exposure plays an integral role in limiting canopy height, potentially reducing aboveground carbon accumulation in older tropical forests.

AB  - Forests simultaneously provide multiple ecosystem services (ESs), but the trade-off and synergy among them were uncertain. Biotic and abiotic variables regulate forest ecosystem service multifunctionality (EMF); however, quantifying the relative contribution of them to EMF in natural forests at large scale was still limited. We examined the trade-off in ecosystem services and the drivers of EMF of natural temperate forests in northeast China. Six facets of ESs were derived based on 2227 national forest inventory sample plots, that is, water conservation, soil conservation, stand productivity, tree species diversity, carbon storage and soil fertility maintenance. Structural equation model was applied to quantify the driving forces of EMF including mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), total nitrogen (TN), soil pH (pH), stand age (Age), additive stand density index (aSDI), stand structural diversity (SSD) and tree species richness (SR). Our results indicated that the RMSD (root mean square deviation) values of the 15 ES pairs ranged from 0.13 to 0.25, and the trade-offs between biodiversity and other five ESs were high, with RMSD values greater than 0.2. We provided clear evidence that stand density was the most important driver of EMF, which affected the EMF indirectly through tree size diversity and species richness. Understanding the contribution of these factors to EMF can help to design sustainable forest management practices in northeast China aiming to foster and preserve multifunctionality.

AB  - Habitat loss affects the nature of biotic interactions in all ecosystems and at all levels of the food web. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to soil nematodes in tropical habitats despite their important role in ecosystem functioning worldwide. Here, we analyzed the influence of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on the absolute and relative density and composition (i.e., trophic guilds) of soil nematode communities associated with the rhizosphere of the tropical herb Heliconia collinsiana in continuous mature forests and human-induced secondary forests. We compared nematode densities based on the following feeding guilds: bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores and predators. Thereafter, we classified herbivorous nematodes into genera and described soil properties in both habitat types including pH, electrical conductivity, and organic matter content. Herbivores were significantly the most abundant feeding guild for both habitats represented by Criconemella spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Meloidogyne spp., which showed no significant differences in density between habitats. Relative but not absolute nematode density differed between habitats, with fungivore nematodes being significantly lower in secondary forests. No significant differences in soil properties were detected. Overall, our results suggest that forest disturbance affects the nematode community associated with the rhizosphere of H. collinsiana which may affect forest succession and the dynamics of the soil biota. Our study contributes to the understanding of biotic interactions in conserved and disturbed tropical habitats.

AB  - Dry forests are the most threatened biome across the global tropics. Despite their massive conversion into agricultural landscapes, local farmers often retain disperse trees and palms within grazing pastures. Understanding how on-farm tree cover in the dry neotropics impacts the environmental and productive functions of pastures is key for biodiversity conservation and the development of climate-resilient production systems.We studied tree composition of 23 dry cattle pastures in Yucatan, Mexico. We assessed the effects of palms, N(2-)fixing trees and non-N-2-fixing trees on microsite environmental conditions, bare soil cover and the performance of grasses and woody plants in their understory during the dry and wet seasons of 2018 and 2019.We found that 45% of the total pool of tree species of the native dry forest is conserved in the pastures of Yucatan. Palms were the most abundant overstory functional group with a relative abundance of 45%, followed by N-2-fixing trees and non-N-2-fixing trees with 33% and 22%.Palms and trees ameliorated the impact of seasonal drought on grasses but slowed down their recovery during the wet season. Palms had overall higher positive effects on grass greenness and height than N-2-fixing trees and non-N-2-fixing trees and these effects were higher during the driest season. Palms decreased bare soil less than trees. Shrubs and tree seedlings tended to increase in the understory of all functional groups as the canopies of palms and trees became denser.Synthesis and applications. Climate warming and the alteration of precipitation regimes are expected to compromise pasture and cattle productivity worldwide. Our results show that fostering the maintenance of a diversity of native palms and trees has positive effects on the functioning of cattle pastures, especially during dry periods. A larger appreciation and understanding of the facilitative effects of remnant palms and trees on pastures during seasonal droughts may help developing more climate-resilient livestock systems that maintain productivity during dry conditions while contributing also to tree biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Mountain forests are important carbon stocks and biodiversity hotspots but are threatened by increased insect outbreaks and climate-driven forest conversion. Soil microorganisms play an eminent role in nutrient cycling in forest habitats and form the basis of soil food webs. Uncovering the driving factors shaping microbial communities and functioning at mountainsides across the world is of eminent importance to better understand their dynamics at local and global scales. We investigated microbial communities and their climatic and local soil-related drivers along an elevational gradient (800-1700 m asl) of primary forests at Changbai Mountain, China. We analyzed substrate-induced respiration and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in litter and two soil layers at seven sites. Microbial biomass (C-mic) peaked in the litter layer and increased towards higher elevations. In the litter layer, the increase in C-mic and in stress indicator ratios was negatively correlated with Ca concentrations indicating increased nutritional stress in high microbial biomass communities at sites with lower Ca availability. PLFA profiles in the litter layer separated low and high elevations, but this was less pronounced in soil, suggesting that the litter layer functions as a buffer for soil microbial communities. Annual variations in temperature correlated with PLFA profiles in all three layers, while annual variations in precipitation correlated with PLFA profiles in upper soil only. Furthermore, the availability of resources, soil moisture, Ca concentrations, and pH structured the microbial communities. Pronounced changes in C-mic and stress indicator ratios in the litter layer between pine-dominated (800-1100 m) and spruce-dominated (1250-1700 m) forests indicated a shift in the structure and functioning of microbial communities between forest types along the elevational gradient. The study highlights strong changes in microbial community structure and functioning along elevational gradients, but also shows that these changes and their driving factors vary between soil layers. Besides annual variations in temperature and precipitation, carbon accumulation and nitrogen acquisition shape changes in microbial communities with elevation at Changbai Mountain.

AB  - Natural regeneration of trees may provide a cost-effective way to restore degraded tropical dry forests, but the factors predominantly affecting natural regeneration success are poorly understood. We performed a multifactor analysis of natural regeneration in an Afromontane forest in Northern Ethiopia. Inventory plots of 400 m(2), each with a nested 9 m(2) subplot, were systematically established. All trees larger than 5 cm DBH and natural regeneration were identified and recorded in the plots and subplots, respectively. Variables describing climate, topography, soil, vegetation, and indications of local human degradation were collected. Determinants of regeneration presence and abundance were analyzed using Hurdle negative binomial regressions. Sixty-nine woody species were represented in the regeneration, with an average regeneration density (SE) of 14,700 (51) ha(-1). The presence of regeneration was positively associated with canopy cover (p < 0.001), distance to the road network (p = 0.04), precipitation (p = 0.003) and tree species diversity (p = 0.03), and negatively with Northing (p = 0.003). The regeneration abundance was positively associated with soil quality (p = 0.001), canopy cover (p = 0.04), and precipitation (p = 0.01). Including the abundance of dominant species in the tree canopy and regeneration layers in the regression model did not affect the presence of natural regeneration, but it clearly affected regeneration abundance. In such a model, the regeneration abundance was positively associated with Euclea racemosa seedlings abundance and negatively associated with the basal area of Dodonaea angustifolia (p = 0.02) and Rhus natalensis (p = 0.04). In this model, forest degradation (p = 0.01) negatively affected the late-successional species regeneration but not the regeneration of the drought-resistant light-demanding species. The low representation of late-successional trees species in the natural regeneration calls for active restoration intervention.

AB  - Purpose High-diversity communities may mitigate the impact of environmental changes on soil erosion owing to the compositional, structural, and functional diversity of their species. In this field study, we explored the relative contributions of these biodiversity components to soil erosion and the mitigating effects of each index under environmental changes (e.g., rainfall intensity). Methods We investigated the compositional (species diversity and evenness), structural (tree diameter and height diversity), and functional diversity (functional richness, evenness, and divergence) of 12 plant communities on Hainan Island, where biodiversity loss is severe. We measured soil erosion in each community using erosion plots under different rainfall intensities. The direction and relative contribution of biodiversity indices to soil erosion were analyzed. Results Except for the functional evenness, high values of biodiversity indices were associated with significantly reduced soil erosion regardless of rainfall intensity, and the relative contribution of tree height diversity was greater than that of other biodiversity indices. In addition, multiple biodiversity factors alleviated the adverse effects of increased rainfall intensity on soil erosion, but plant structural diversity had a greater positive effect than compositional and functional diversity, predominantly because of tree height diversity. Conclusions The results confirmed that the consideration of multiple biodiversity components provides an improved understanding of the relationship between biodiversity loss and soil erosion. We emphasize that protection of tree height diversity may not only effectively reduce current soil erosion, but also resist the adverse impact of increased rainfall intensity on soil erosion in the future.

AB  - Increases in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes influence the structure, function, and resilience of Caribbean forests. Trees in such forests harbor diverse fungal endophytes within leaves and roots. Fungal endophytes often are important for plant health and stress responses, but how their communities are impacted by hurricanes is not well known. We measured forest disturbance in Carite State Forest in Puerto Rico ca. 16 months after the passage of Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm. In three sites, each comprising three plots representing a local gradient of hurricane disturbance, we evaluated soil chemistry and used culture-free analyses to measure richness, phylogenetic diversity, and composition of endophyte communities in leaves and roots. We found that endophyte richness did not vary significantly among plant families or as a function of soil chemistry. Instead, leaf endophytes peaked in richness and decreased in phylogenetic diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance. Root endophytes did not show such variation, but both leaf- and root endophyte communities differed in species composition as a function of disturbance across the forest. Locations with less disturbance typically hosted distinctive assemblages of foliar endophytes, whereas more disturbed locations had more regionally homogeneous endophyte communities. Together, our results show that changes in endophyte richness and phylogenetic diversity can be detected in aboveground tissues more than a year after major storms. In turn, pervasive shifts in endophyte community composition both aboveground and belowground suggest a subtle and lasting effect of hurricanes that merits further study, potentially contributing to the promotion of spatially heterogeneous endophyte assemblages at a landscape scale in these diverse island forests.

AB  - Plant communities and fungi inhabiting their phyllospheres change along precipitation gradients and often respond to changes in land use. Many studies have focused on the changes in foliar fungal communities on specific plant species, however, few have addressed the association between whole plant communities and their phyllosphere fungi. We sampled plant communities and associated phyllosphere fungal communities in native prairie remnants and post-agricultural sites across the steep precipitation gradient in the central plains in Kansas, USA. Plant community cover data and MiSeq ITS2 metabarcode data of the phyllosphere fungal communities indicated that both plant and fungal community composition respond strongly to mean annual precipitation (MAP), but less so to land use (native prairie remnants vs. post-agricultural sites). However, plant and fungal diversity were greater in the native remnant prairies than in post-agricultural sites. Overall, both plant and fungal diversity increased with MAP and the communities in the arid and mesic parts of the gradient were distinct. Analyses of the linkages between plant and fungal communities (Mantel and Procrustes tests) identified strong correlations between the composition of the two. However, despite the strong correlations, regression models with plant richness, diversity, or composition (ordination axis scores) and land use as explanatory variables for fungal diversity and evenness did not improve the models compared to those with precipitation and land use (Delta AIC < 2), even though the explanatory power of some plant variables was greater than that of MAP as measured by R-2. Indicator taxon analyses suggest that grass species are the primary taxa that differ in the plant communities. Similar analyses of the phyllosphere fungi indicated that many plant pathogens are disproportionately abundant either in the arid or mesic environments. Although decoupling the drivers of fungal communities and their composition - whether abiotic or host-dependent - remains a challenge, our study highlights the distinct community responses to precipitation and the tight tracking of the plant communities by their associated fungal symbionts.

AB  - Tropical Cyclone Yaas inflicted substanntial damage on Bhitarkanika National Park (BNP), an eminent wildlife sanctuary housing a vast diversity of flora and fauna, during its occurrence in 2021. The park has experienced a heightened frequency of cyclonic activity in recent years. This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of Tropical Cyclone Yaas on the mangrove forest within BNP, utilizing a broad array of physical, biological, and ecological indices. The assessment method employed in the study encompasses various indicators, such as ecological (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI, Enhanced Vegetation Index - EVI, Leaf Area Index - LAI, Normalized Difference Water Index - NDWI, and Normalized Difference Salinity Index - NDSI), biological (Chlorophyll content and Gross Primary Productivity - GPP), and physical (flood monitoring and precipitation) measures. Our findings elucidate the destructive consequences of Cyclone Yaas on the mangrove forest, inflicting significant ecosystem loss attributable to the extreme precipitation and high wind speeds. The biophysical, ecological, and biological indicators reveal profound effects on the local ecosystem, manifested through a decline in vegetation vigor and alterations in soil conditions, notably marked by an increase in salinity.

AB  - Species may co-occur due to responses to similar environmental conditions, biological associations, or simply because of coincident geographical distributions. Disentangling patterns of co-occurrence and potential biotic and abiotic interactions is crucial to understand ecosystem function. Here, we used DNA metabarcoding data from litter and mineral soils collected from a longitudinal transect in Amazonia to explore patterns of co-occurrence. We compared data from different Amazonian habitat types, each with a characteristic biota and environmental conditions. These included non-flooded rainforests (terra-firme), forests seasonally flooded by fertile white waters (varzeas) or by unfertile black waters (igapos), and open areas associated with white sand soil (campinas). We ran co-occurrence network analyses based on null models and Spearman correlation for all samples and for each habitat separately. We found that one third of all operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were bacteria and two thirds were eukaryotes. The resulting networks were nevertheless mostly composed of bacteria, with fewer fungi, protists, and metazoans. Considering the functional traits of the OTUs, there is a combination of metabolism modes including respiration and fermentation for bacteria, and a high frequency of saprotrophic fungi (those that feed on dead organic matter), indicating a high turnover of organic material. The organic carbon and base saturation indices were important in the co-occurrences in Amazonian networks, whereas several other soil properties were important for the co-exclusion. Different habitats had similar network properties with some variation in terms of modularity, probably associated with flooding pulse. We show that Amazonian microorganism communities form highly interconnected co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks, which highlights the importance of complex biotic and abiotic interactions in explaining the outstanding biodiversity of the region.

AB  - 1. Mangrove forests, one of the highest carbon density ecosystems, are very different from other forests as they occupy saline and tidal habitats. Although previous studies in forests, shrublands and grasslands have shown a positive effect of biodiversity on plant biomass and carbon storage, it remains unclear whether this relation to biodiversity also exists in mangrove forests.
   2. Here, we evaluate the possible effects of mangrove species diversity, structural characteristics and environmental factors on mangrove biomass production and carbon storage, using survey data from 234 field plots of 30 transects in the mangrove forests along the coastlines of Hainan Island, China, during 2017 and 2018.
   3. We found that mangrove species diversity had a positive effect, not only on mangrove biomass production but also on soil carbon storage. This positive effect was more strongly evident in the forest communities than in either the shrub communities or forest-shrub mixed communities, with the forest type having the biggest mangrove biodiversity and carbon storage. Besides, the diversity effect was affected by structural characteristics, namely, mangrove biomass increased exponentially with tree stem diameter and decreased with tree density. Furthermore, we observed a resource-dependent mediation of the mangrove ecosystem when linking diversity to biomass. The areas with high soil Nitrogen content and Mean annual precipitation (MAP) showed higher mangrove biomass and carbon storage. This suggests that the spatial pattern of mangrove carbon storage and diversity was driven by both climate factors (MAP) and soil fertility (soil N).
   4. To our knowledge, this is the first study based on an intensive field survey that has verified the positive effect of biodiversity on mangrove biomass and carbon storage. Our findings suggest that mangrove forests with greater diversity also have higher carbon storage capacities and conservation potential. Thus, biodiversity conservation is crucial for mangroves to mitigate the greenhouse effect. Our findings strengthen the understanding of the diversity effects on mangrove ecosystem services and have important implications for mangrove restoration and conservation.

AB  - Forage cactus (Opuntia spp. and Nopalea spp.) is a crop tolerant to drought, high temperatures, and less fertile soils, which favors its cultivation in arid and semi-arid regions and production of cladodes to animal feed. Intercropping may improve water use efficiency and increase agricultural production sustainability. The aim of this research was to evaluate the growth and yield of forage cactus genotypes intercropped with timber species under semi-arid conditions. Three forage cactus genotypes, erect prickly pear 'Orelha de ElefanteMexicana' [O. stricta (Haw.) Haw.], 'Miuda' [N. cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck: syn. O. cochenillifera (L.) Mill.], and 'Baiana' [N. cochenillifera (L.) Salm-Dyck] in three cropping systems (monocropping; intercropped with Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC.; and intercropped with Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth.) were studied. All species were irrigated with treated domestic effluent water. Plants were evaluated after 2 yr of cultivation. The forage cactus intercropped with timber species had lower cladode weight, dry matter yield, and lower carrying capacity than forage cactus in monocropped system regardless of genotype. These results suggest that timber species may inhibit the yield of forage cactus, and intercropping is not recommended. In addition, there was no significant difference in the performance of forage cactus when intercropping with M. caesalpiniifolia and P. juliflora. The P. juliflora had greater growth performance when compared with M. caesalpiniifolia intercropped with Miuda and Orelha de Elefante Mexicana. However, when intercropped with the Baiana, the growth of P. juliflora and M. caesalpiniifolia are similar to each other.

AB  - Habitat quality is a key indicator for assessing the biodiversity-maintenance functions of ecosystem services. The issue of habitat quality changes in semi-arid and arid areas has been becoming serious, but there are few deep investigations of habitat quality in these regions, such as studies of the temporal and spatial changes of habitat quality and its driving forces. This study focuses on the agro-pastoral ecotone of northern Shaanxi with vulnerable biodiversity. By using the Fragstats software, the InVEST model, and the Geo-detector model, we analyzed land-use data collected from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, and we explored the landscape pattern index, the spatial and temporal variation of habitat quality, and the influence of its drivers. GDP, population density, precipitation, temperature, land use, NDVI, elevation, and slope were detected by Geo-detector. The research results show that: (1) Arable land and grassland were the dominant land types from 1990 to 2020, and there was significant mutual circulation between arable land and grassland. Forest area increased by 24%. Many other land-use types were transformed into construction land, and construction land increased by 727% compared with the base period. (2) Landscape heterogeneity increased in the study region, shown by the fractured structure of the overall landscape and by the aggravated human disturbance of the landscape. (3) Average habitat quality underwent a trend of oscillation. Regarding spatial distribution, habitat quality was higher in the east than in the west. (4) The influencing factors of habitat quality monitored by Geo-detectors show that the driving force of land use on habitat quality was the strongest, followed by precipitation and vegetation coverage. Elevation, slope, GDP, and population density had the least influence on habitat quality. The bi-factor interaction enhanced habitat quality to different levels. This study is critical to the conservation of biodiversity and to ecological civilization construction in arid and semi-arid regions.

AB  - Vegetation composition and structural diversity are important for biodiversity conservation and forest carbon storage.. Less attention has been paid to tropical forest vegetation characteristics and the carbon stock across different pools in Nigeria. This study presents the results of a rapid assessment and exploratory estimate of the woody species composition, biomass and carbon stock of six plots in order to gain quantitative insight into the carbon pools in the lowland forests across Southwest (SW) Nigeria. Using plot level quadrat (25 x 25 m) approach, this study explores the structural characteristic and carbon stock potential of the tropical natural forest.. Woody species composition, density, girth-size, height, basal area, and carbon stock from five major pools and their impact on total carbon storage were determined. A total of 89 woody species with mean density of 770.67/ha were enumerated and species structural composition, biomass and carbon stock differed among the investigated plots. Plots III and IV had the highest total number of species and woody density. The species diversity also varies across the plots, and ranged between 2.01 in Plot VI to 2.91 in Plot III. Although majority of the species present in Plots I, II, IV, and VI have lower species importance value index and smaller girth sizes, there were still few individuals with high girth-size. Above and below ground pools suggest that the study area has the capacity of storing between 145.17 to 745.57 Mg C ha(-1) of carbon. Carbon stock estimate of the aboveground pool (1,593.89 MgC/ha) was higher than the belowground pool (595.19 MgC/ha) and carbon contribution from litter (0.0203 MgC/ha) and herb (0.0067 MgC/ha) was quite low. Overall, these findings have shown that despite the ongoing anthropogenic disturbance, SW Nigeria tropical forest has considerable potential carbon sequestration.

AB  - The sensitivity of the photosynthetic response of Amazonian forests to ENSO-induced drought events is more strongly related to background seasonality in precipitation, soil conditions and species composition than drought intensity, according to remote sensing and statistical analysis.
   Amazon forests have experienced multiple large-scale droughts in recent decades, which have increased tree mortality and reduced carbon sequestration. However, the extent to which drought sensitivity varies across Amazonian forests and its key controls remain poorly quantified. Here, we analyse satellite remotely-sensed Solar Induced Fluorescence anomalies to investigate responses in Amazon forest photosynthetic activity to the 2015-2016 El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought. Using multivariate regression analysis, we examine the relative importance of ENSO-associated climate anomalies, background climate and soil characteristics in controlling basin-wide forest photosynthetic activity differences. Our model explains 25% of forest photosynthetic response and indicates background climate and soil conditions had a greater influence than the climatic anomalies experienced. We find marked sensitivity differences across Amazonia, with North-Western forests being the most sensitive to precipitation anomalies, likely relating to variation in forest species composition and background water stress. Such factors should be considered in climate change impact simulations.

AB  - Background: Biodiversity supports multiple ecosystem services, whereas species loss endangers the provision of many services and affects ecosystem resilience and resistance capacity. The increase of remote sensing techniques allows to estimate biodiversity and ecosystem services supply at the landscape level in areas with low available data (e.g. Southern Patagonia). This paper evaluates the potential biodiversity and how it links with ecosystem services, based on vascular plant species across eight ecological areas. We also evaluated the habitat plant requirements and their relation with natural gradients. A total of 977 plots were used to develop habitat suitability maps based on an environmental niche factor analysis of 15 more important indicator species for each ecological area (n = 53 species) using 40 explanatory variables. Finally, these maps were combined into a single potential biodiversity map, which was linked with environmental variables and ecosystem services supply. For comparisons, data were extracted and compared through analyses of variance.
   Results: The plant habitat requirements varied greatly among the different ecological areas, and it was possible to define groups according to its specialization and marginality indexes. The potential biodiversity map allowed us to detect coldspots in the western mountains and hotspots in southern and eastern areas. Higher biodiversity was associated to higher temperatures and normalized difference vegetation index, while lower biodiversity was related to elevation and rainfall. Potential biodiversity was closely associated with supporting and provisioning ecosystem services in shrublands and grasslands in the humid steppe, while the lowest values were related to cultural ecosystem services in Nothofagus forests.

AB  - Tropical forests are recognized for their role in providing diverse ecosystem services (ESs), with carbon uptake the best recognized. The capacity of tropical forests to provide ESs is strongly linked to their enormous biodiversity. However, causal relationships between biodiversity and ESs are poorly understood. This may be because biodiversity is often translated into species richness. Here, we argue that focusing on multiple attributes of biodiversity-structure, composition, and function-will make relationships between biodiversity and ESs clearer. In this review, we discuss the ecological processes behind ESs from tropical humid and subhumid forests of South America. Our main goal is to understand the links between the ESs and those three biodiversity attributes. While supporting and regulating services relate more closely to forest structure and function, provisioning services relate more closely to forest composition and function, and cultural services are more related to structure and composition attributes. In this sense, ESs from subhumid forests (savannas) differ from those provided by the Amazon Forest, although both ecosystems are recognized as harboring tremendous biodiversity. Given this, if anthropogenic drivers of change promote a shift in the Amazon Forest toward savanna-the savannization hypothesis-the types of services provided will change, especially climate regulating services. This review emphasizes the importance of deeply understanding ecosystem structure, composition, and function to better understand the services ecosystems provide. Understanding that anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity occur through these three main attributes, it becomes easier to anticipate how humans will impact ESs.

AB  - Oak decline presenting symptoms of tracheomycosis have been observed globally over long periods of time. Since the 1990s, oak decline has been considered to be a multifactorial process where abiotic predisposing factors play a significant role. Nevertheless, biotic factors, such as subcortical insects and fungal pathogens, may influence the decline process, as some insect species transmit spores of tracheomycotic pathogens. We investigated biotic agents (subcortical insects, Ophiostoma spp. and Phytophthora spp.) in six declining oak stands located within mesophytic and thermophytic zones in the Czech Republic, where five dry years occurred from 2015 to 2019. The spectrum of insect pests of oak stands was investigated using two methods: reared from logs from each stand and window traps. The presence of Ophiostoma fungi was assessed from cultivated woodblocks; Phytophthora pathogens were isolated from soil samples. In total, 2931 subcortical insect individuals were captured during the 2021 vegetation period. The most species-rich group of the subcortical insect complex involved in oak decline consisted of the families Cerambycidae: Xylotrechus antilope; Curculionidae: Scolytus intricatus, Xyleborus monographus; and Buprestidae: Agrilus biguttatus, A. sulcicollis. The presence of Ophiostoma was detected in all stands with different intensities between tree parts. Several important oak pests were positively correlated with the occurrence of Ophiostoma. On the contrary, from all soil samples, Phytophthora plurivora was found at only one studied oak stand. Based on the results, a new modified model of biotic and abiotic factors involved in the oak decline is proposed.

AB  - Madagascar is known for its high diversity and endemism of fauna and flora. Fungi, however, have been largely overlooked in diversity and evolution studies on the island, and whether fungi exhibit the same patterns as animals and plants has yet to be further examined. We collected fungal sporocarps and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) roots during three opportunistic surveys in five forests in Madagascar and generated a dataset of fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) DNA sequences. We analyzed them together with all publicly available fungal ITS DNA sequences and identified 620 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from Madagascar, 10% of which contained only sequences from our surveys. Two hundred and ninety-two OTUs belonged to EcM species with /russula-lactarius, /boletus, /tomentella-telephora, /cortinarius, and /amanita being the most abundant EcM lineages. Overall, 60% of all fungi and 81% of the EcM species from Madagascar appear to be endemic. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis using all the OTUs in Amanitaceae, Boletaceae, and Russulaceae families to elucidate their relative timing of arrival in Madagascar. We found that most EcM species from Madagascar in the three families diverged less than 22 million years ago (mya), long after the separation of India and Madagascar (88 mya), which is consistent with a dispersal mediated process of arrival to the island. Our study provides the first comprehensive view of the overall DNA-based fungal diversity in Madagascar and the current state of knowledge of EcM fungi based on DNA sequences, useful for further ecological and evolutionary studies.Abstract in Malagasy is available with online material.

AB  - Regeneration of tropical forest occurs naturally and mainly through early secondary succession by soil seed banks. Here, we analyzed seed bank variation in density and diversity along a degradation gradient. We also explored the relationship (similarity in composition) between the seed and seedling banks and the overstory vegetation. The investigated forests were located at Dja Fauna Reserve and its surroundings, south-eastern Cameroon. We sampled 33 one-ha forest plots scattered in a protected area, in a logging concession and in community forests. Within each plot, we inventoried the seed bank in the litter and in four successive soil layers of 5 cm depth interval, and the standing vegetation. Seed density significantly varied with sampling depth but not between land use types. A total of 181 morphospecies were identified. Trees species accounted for 46% of seeds with pioneer species dispersed by animals dominating the seed bank. Species diversity and composition strongly varied with the sampling depth; the litter seed bank was more similar in composition to the soil seed bank than to the seedling bank, sapling, and forest stands. We highlighted the presence of a dense and diverse seed bank in each land use type. We also showed the differentiation of each sampling depth in terms of species composition, thus revealing their complementarity in the dynamics of natural regeneration. The dominance of pioneers in the seed bank and weak relationship with the overstory are universal for tropical forests and logically follow from forest succession after disturbance.

AB  - Since the birth of soil science, climate has been recognized as a soil-forming factor, along with parent rock, time, topog-raphy, and organisms (from which humans were later kept distinct), often prevalent on the other factors on the very long term. But the climate is in turns affected by soils and their management. This paper describes the interrelationships between climate - and its current change - and soil, focusing on each single factor of its formation. Parent material gov-erns, primarily through the particle size distribution, the capacity of soil to retain water and organic matter, which are two main soil-related drivers of the climate. Time is the only unmanageable soil-forming factor; however, extreme cli-matic phenomena can upset the soil or even dismantle it, so as to slow down the pathway of pedogenesis or even make it start from scratch. Topography, which drives the pedogenesis mostly controlling rainfall distribution - with reper-cussions also on the climate - is not anymore a given factor because humans have often become a shaper of it. Indeed humans now play a key role in affecting in a plethora of ways those soil properties that most deal with climate. The abundance and diversity of the other organisms are generally positive to soil quality and as a buffer for climate, but there are troubling evidences that climate change is decreasing soil biodiversity. The corpus of researches on mutual feedback between climate and soil has essentially demonstrated that the best soil management in terms of climate change mitigation must aim at promoting vegetation growth and maximizing soil organic matter content and water retention. Some ongoing virtuous initiatives (e.g., the Great Green Wall of Africa) and farming systems (e.g., the conservation agriculture) should be extended as much as possible worldwide to enable the soil to make the greatest contribution to climate change mitigation.

AB  - Invasive plants affect ecosystems across various scales. In particular, they affect the quality and quantity of litter, which influences the composition of decomposing (lignocellulolytic) fungal communities. However, the relationship among the quality of invasive litter, lignocellulolytic cultivated fungal community composition, and litter decomposition rates under invasive conditions is still unknown. We evaluated whether the invasive herbaceous Tradescantia zebrina affects the litter decomposition in the Atlantic Forest and the lignocellulolytic cultivated fungal community composition. We placed litter bags with litter from the invader and native plants in invaded and non-invaded areas, as well as under controlled conditions. We evaluated the lignocellulolytic fungal communities by culture method and molecular identification. Litter from T. zebrina decomposed faster than litter from native species. However, the invasion of T. zebrina did not alter decomposition rates of either litter type. Although the lignocellulolytic fungal community composition changed over decomposition time, neither the invasion of T. zebrina nor litter type influenced lignocellulolytic fungal communities. We believe that the high plant richness in the Atlantic Forest enables a highly diversified and stable decomposing biota formed in conditions of high plant diversity. This diversified fungal community is capable of interacting with different litter types under different environmental conditions.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the effect on litter decomposition of the geographical and land-use gradient from the dry Cerrado in Mato Grosso to the southern Amazonian rainforest in Par ' a, Brazil. The study area also rep-resents a gradient of land-use intensification, reaching from the southern Cerrado region which had the most active land use change and agricultural intensification in the past to the northern rainforest region where agricultural use is currently intensifying. We assessed the effects on litter decomposition of climate (seasonality: rainy vs dry), litter quality (litter type: standard maize litter vs local habitat litter), disturbance (land-use: forest vs pasture vs cropland), soil organisms (soil fauna: inclusion vs exclusion), and original land cover/vegetation gradient (region: savanna vs transitional zone vs rain forest). Our results showed that the contribution of the different soil organism groups (mesh size) to litter decomposition was strongly influenced by the change in land -use, but also by the original land-cover/vegetation of the region. The overall effect of climate seasonality on decomposition was particularly pronounced at higher latitudes, whereas at lower latitudes only minimal effects were found.

AB  - Sacred groves are areas of native forest that have been protected by the local people for centuries through socio-cultural and religious practices. Many of these sites are critical biodiversity hotspots. Hence, religious beliefs and myths are considered as the primary factor for their conservation in the majority of studies. In this review, we use Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) to identify the driver of tree species richness in sacred groves at a large spatial scale in Indian subcontinent by selecting 218 sacred groves from 33 research papers and 12 doctoral theses. Six variables were selected to explain tree species richness: grove area (hec.), survey method, site elevation (m), average annual precipitation (mm), annual mean temperature (degrees C) and religion of the community associated with sacred grove. Our findings indicated that the tree species richness in groves is influenced by multiple variables (except religion), and the relationship with area, and average annual rainfall was positive and significant (P < 0.05). Individual model with religion showed considerable uncertainty being below the null model. Floristic surveys reported slightly higher diversity of tree species than plot-based sampling. We recommend that larger sacred groves be prioritised for conservation and management as they support greater tree diversity.

AB  - Among worldwide tropical forest ecosystems, the Atlantic forest of Brazil stands out as a highly fragile area and a biodiversity hotspot, with a high degree of endemism. The Capara?o National Park is an important conservation area for this biome, where recent studies have found new species of animals and plants, including endemic and highly vulnerable ones. We analyzed interannual and seasonal trends in vegetation for Capara?o National Park and its buffer zone, using data from MODIS vegetation indices between the years 2001 and 2019. Our methods included both parametric (linear trend and linear correlation) and non-parametric (Mann-Kendall) analyses of interannual trends, wavelet transform, and seasonal trends analysis. We also studied the correlation of the vegetation index data with the variability of monthly rainfall data from the TRMM satellite. We generated linear regression analyses, with precipitation as the independent variable and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as the dependent variable, and repeated this procedure for time lags from 0 to 3 months. In accordance with the findings of the temporal profiles and Mann Kendall trend method identified a prevalence of decreasing trend in the values of vegetation indices in Capara?o National Park, with values higher than 90% of the regions where the result was significant, for the EVI and 80% for the NDVI. For the buffer zone, there is an increasing trend for the NDVI and EVI, with values higher than 50% of the regions where the result was significant. In most of the area, a positive slope was found in the buffer zone, while in the Caparao? National Park the slope was predominantly negative. The r values indicated tendencies predominantly positive for the buffer zone and predominantly negative for the area within the park. 66.9% of the results were positive trends for ndvi in the buffer zone, and 51.7% for EVI, both for r value and slope. In the park area, this trend was negative in 68.9% of the area for ndvi in both methods; 93.8% for the EVI and 93.9% for the NDVI. These differences may be evidence of how vegetation responds to disturbances, once the vegetation in the buffer zone is fragmented and does not have the same protection as vegetation in the park area. The native vegetation in study area shows seasonal similarities, as detected by seasonal trend analysis and wavelets transform. The existence of two annual cycles is a common feature to the biome of Atlantic forest. R values for the correlation of precipitation with vegetation indices indicate high dependence of vegetation on precipitation in the study area. Values in the 0.4 to 0.8 class, represented almost 80% of the buffer zone for the NDVI and 90% for the EVI. For Capara?o National Park, this class accounted for 27% and 38% of the area for the NDVI and EVI, respectively. Vegetation in the protected area was less dependent on rainfall, which can be attributed to the fact that it can better meet its water needs through available water in the soil. In addition, due to anthropogenic pressures and a high degree of forest fragmentation, vegetation in the buffer zone may have less advanced successional stages. Our results collaborate with the range of vegetation studies in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. This methodology can be applied to larger areas around the world to provide information on vegetation trends conditions and influence of climatic variables.

AB  - As a land use management system, agroforestry has environmental, economic and societal benefits over conventional agriculture or forestry. Important benefits of combining tree growth with agricultural crops and/or forage production systems include higher biodiversity through more diverse habitats, the control of runoff and soil erosion, the augmentation of soil water availability, the creation of microclimates, carbon sequestration and provision of a more diverse farm economy. As the climate changes, north eastern Germany is likely to be particularly prone to severe effects from droughts and wind erosion in the future. However, the area of land under agroforestry makes up less than 2% of the total agricultural area in Germany. Through qualitative interviews with key actors, this study analyzed the benefits of, potentials for and barriers to implementing agroforestry systems in the federal state of Brandenburg. Results showed that agroforestry systems have significant potential in relation to several benefits, particularly the mitigation of soil erosion and stabilization of microclimate regimes. Additionally, agroforestry has the potential to provide wood for energy production or material uses. Although a small but highly innovative and interlinked community exists, administrative barriers and high start-up costs currently hamper the transition from conventional agriculture to agroforestry systems.

AB  - Ecological agriculture (E.A.) protects soil, water, and the climate, ensuring nutritious food. It encourages biodiversity and prohibits chemical inputs or hybrids. Agricultural development strategy should prioritize the development of water, land, forests, biodiversity, agricultural infrastructure, research and extension, technology transfer, investment, and unified management to bring about significant changes in agriculture. Agricultural practices have resulted in deforestation, biodiversity loss, ecosystem extinction, genetic engineering, irrigation issues, pollution, degraded soils, and related waste. Food producers increasingly use artificial neural networks (ANN) at most agricultural production and farm management stages. A new EA-ANN method, including agriculture, has been widely employed to solve categorization and prediction tasks. In addition to maintaining natural resources, sustainable agriculture helps preserve soil quality, reduces erosion, and conserves water. Ecological farming uses ecological services, including water filtering, pollination, oxygen generation, and disease and insect management. ANN increases harvest quality and accuracy of evaluating the economy by enhancing productivity. Agriculture's prediction and economic profitability are focused on the energy optimization afforded by ANN. Ecological knowledge is assessed in light of commercial markets' inability to provide sufficient environmental goods. Future agriculture can include robotics, sensors, aerial photos, and global positioning systems. The proposed method uses supervised artificial learning to read the data and provide an output based on effectively classifying the natural and constructed environment. The probability distribution implemented in ANN is a function specifying all possible values and probabilities of a random variable within a specific range of values. The mathematical model assumes that EA-ANN utilizes machine learning on an internet of things platform with bio-sensor assistance to achieve ecological agriculture. Microbial biotechnology is activated, and the best option for EA-ANN is calculated for an effective data-driven model. This ensures profitability and limits the impacts of manufacturing, such as pollution and waste, on the environment. Various agricultural strategies can result in environmental concerns. The EA-ANN methodology is used to make accurate predictions using field data. Agricultural workers can use the results to plan for the future of water resources more effectively.

AB  - Biodiversity and ecosystem functions are highly threatened by global change. It has been proposed that geodiversity can be used as an easy-to-measure surrogate of biodiversity to guide conservation management. However, so far, there is mixed evidence to what extent geodiversity can predict biodiversity and ecosystem functions at the regional scale relevant for conservation planning. Here, we analyse how geodiversity computed as a compound index is suited to predict the diversity of four taxa and associated ecosystem functions in a tropical mountain hotspot of biodiversity and compare the results with the predictive power of environmental conditions and resources (climate, habitat, soil). We show that combinations of these environmental variables better explain species diversity and ecosystem functions than a geodiversity index and identified climate variables as more important predictors than habitat and soil variables, although the best predictors differ between taxa and functions. We conclude that a compound geodiversity index cannot be used as a single surrogate predictor for species diversity and ecosystem functions in tropical mountain rain forest ecosystems and is thus little suited to facilitate conservation management at the regional scale. Instead, both the selection and the combination of environmental variables are essential to guide conservation efforts to safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

AB  - Deciding how to establish woodland in forest restoration is not straightforward as different outcomes may be obtained from different establishment approaches, each with cost implications and degree of success limitations attached. Planning restoration requires knowledge of site conditions, including how sites are likely to respond under climate change. For objectives of production and high timber quality it is likely that ground preparation will be used, and planting with forest reproductive material (FRM) of known traits, such as: high survival and growth in establishment, drought tolerance adequate for climate projections, good resistance to pests and pathogens. For objectives associated with biodiversity, carbon sequestration, water supply protection, soil protection, natural regeneration could be a less costly solution with a limited amount of assisted translocation of selected FRM to improve resilience. If objectives are for rewilding forest areas, a degree of natural colonisation perhaps with translocation of some FRM could be a solution. Ignoring site conditions and suitability of available sources of FRM for forest restoration is likely to provide unexpected results with a mix of open ground, scrub and scattered trees resulting from climate, herbivore, and browsing impacts. The recent B4EST EU Horizon 2020 project examined progress in novel rapid approaches for testing the quality of FRM from existing genetic trials. Here we review the work of B4EST to show the opportunities from transformative tree breeding in forest restoration schemes, including: new climate projection ensembles at high temporal and spatial resolution to develop norms of reaction and transfer models with genetic components; multi-environment genotype-phenotype associations and multi-locus genotype-environment associations in identifying drivers of local adaptation; techniques for genomic selection using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to derive functional traits from polygenic associations; work on seed orchard site and climate specific FRM and zones for deployment; and work on some of the forest ecosystem service benefits derived at a landscape scale. We conclude that tree-breeding will provide robust forest restoration for planting, and rewilding (assisted natural regeneration), and if not "ignoring" but instead assisting natural colonisation processes - tree breeding may improve long-term forest resilience under environmental change.

AB  - The distribution of the often dominant in density and biomass epi-endogeic and endogeic earthworm species in forests of the Northwest Caucasus was estimated based on a large array of field data and GIS modeling of modern potential areas. Quantitative accountings of earthworms were conducted annually from 2014 to 2019 in different types of forests: sticky alder forest, small-leaved forests, broadleaf forests (hornbeam and beech forests), coniferous-deciduous forests, dark coniferous forests, and pine forests (792 geographic locations). It is shown that the native species of the Caucasian fauna dominate in the number and biomass from piedmont to high mountain forests. The most widespread species that is found in all types of forests from low to high mountains and makes the main contribution to the biomass of earthworms is the Crimean-Caucasian subendemic Dendrobaena schmidti. Peregrine species of epi-endogeic and endogeic earthworms inhabit sticky alder forest, small-leaved, broadleaf and pine forests in which they inhabit together with native species, while not dominating either in numbers or in biomass among other species. Dark coniferous forests are inhabited mainly by the native endogeic species D. schmidti and A. jassyensis. Maxent modeling shows that the species of the endogeic earthworm group have wider potential areas than epi-endogeic species. The most significant bioclimatic factors that make the greatest contribution to the distribution: amount of precipitation in the driest month, altitude above the sea level, isothermality.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that biodiversity promotes ecological stability in changing environments. However, understanding diversity-stability relationships and their underlying mechanisms across large-scale tree diversity and natural environmental gradients are still controversial and largely lacking. We used thirty-nine 0.12 ha longterm permanent forest plots spanning China's various forest types to test the effects of multiple abiotic (climate, soil, age and topography) and biotic factors (taxonomic and structural diversity, functional diversity and community-mean traits, and species asynchrony) on biomass stability and its components (mean biomass and biomass variability) over time. We used multiple analytical methods to identify the best explanatory variables and complicated causal relationships for community biomass stability. Our results showed that species richness increased biomass stability by promoting species asynchrony. Structural and functional diversity had a weaker effect on biomass stability. Forest age and structural diversity increased mean biomass and biomass variability significantly and simultaneously. Communities dominated by tree species with high wood density had high biomass stability. Soil nitrogen enhanced biomass stability directly and indirectly through its effects on mean biomass. Soil nitrogen to phosphorus ratio increased biomass stability via increasing species asynchrony. Precipitation indirectly increased biomass stability by affecting tree diversity. Moreover, the direct and indirect effects of soil nutrients on biomass stability were greater than that of climate variables. Our results suggest that species asynchrony is the main mechanism proposed to explain the stabilizing effect of diversity on community biomass, supporting two mechanisms, namely, the biodiversity insurance hypothesis and complementary dynamics. Soil and climate factors also play an important role in shaping diversity-stability relationships. Our results provide a new insight into how tree diversity affects ecosystem stability across diverse community types and large-scale environmental gradients.

AB  - Glaciers cover nearly 10% of the Earth's surface and are unique biomes dominated by microbial communities that support key ecosystem processes. The melting of glaciers is among the most conspicuous consequences of global climate change, with impacts on microbial ecology and associated biogeochemistry. However, we are still missing an integrative understanding of microbial biodiversity from divergent habitats associated with glaciers. Here, we compiled global microbiome metadata from 93 representative glaciers over 180 locations and used random forest, microbial ecological networks and structural equation modelling to evaluate the biodiversity and environmental factors associated with the glacier microbiomes of seven contrasting habitats: water, epilithic biofilm, cryoconite, mat, ice, sediment and permafrost soil. The results showed that microbial diversity largely changed across habitats, with the highest in permafrost soil, followed by sediment, ice, mat, cryoconite, water and epilithic biofilm. More importantly, we provided critical evidence that the environmental and climatic factors associated with the microbiomes of glaciers varied with glacier habitats. Microbial diversity in water was highly correlated with latitude, cryoconite microbial diversity was significantly (p = 0.01) correlated with pH, and permafrost soil and sediment microbial diversity were mainly explained by temperature (17.05% and 13.37% respectively). Using ecological association network analysis, we identified some tightly linked common microbial taxa (e.g. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes) that were present in all the habitats and were vulnerable to climatic factors, such as temperature and precipitation. This study demonstrated that microbial diversity, drivers and co-occurrence patterns differ among glacier habitats globally, and diverse habitat-dependent glacier microbiomes could serve as early warning sentinels for the study of life on glaciers and its potential future in a warming world.

However, despite the multiple SPS's benefits to soil and ecosystem, there is a paucity of comprehensive studies revealing the potential soil health (SH) restoration through SPS. Here, by developing an overall SH index using local native vegetation (Amazon rainforest) as a reference, we aimed to assess SH changes induced by the land transition from the traditional livestock production system to the SPS in the Colombian Amazon region. A chronosequence conformed by three areas: (i) native vegetation, (ii) traditional pasture and (iii) silvopastoral system was established in two study sites located in the Colombian Amazon, specifically in Caqueta State, the second hotspot of deforestation in the Amazon Basin. The results indicated high soil compaction and loss of macrofauna diversity and richness due to pasture management, causing a loss of 9% of soil capacity to function. In contrast, by integrating 31 soil indicators, our SH assessment revealed that SPS was an effective strategy for the recovery of SH, impacting positively multiple soil functions related to nutrient dynamics, water retention and supply, and biological activity.

AB  - Livestock grazing of drylands supports millions of livelihoods worldwide; however, overgrazing causes severe biodiversity loss and degrades ecosystem functions. Understanding the effects of grazing intensity, aridity, and soil microbes is required for sustainable management. Here, we focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in soils and roots and examined their relationship with ecosystem multifunctionality under livestock grazing of Mongolian grasslands with different aridity levels. Above-and below-ground plant biomass were used to measure ecosystem-service multifunctionality, excluding annual plants that are unfavorable for ecosystem function and rangeland management. In both mountain forest steppe (mean annual precipitation = 207.7 mm) and steppe-desert steppe transition zone (mean annual precipitation = 128.4 mm), ecosystem multifunctionality was decreased by livestock grazing, as indicated by palatable plant shoot biomass. In line with the multifunctionality, the dominant plant species, Stipa krylovii, and AM plant biomass were decreased by livestock grazing. The Berger-Parker dominance index of soil AM fungi and Simpson's diversity had a positive and negative relationship with multifunctionality, respectively, indicating that dominant AM fungi rather than AM fungal diversity in soil are key for maintaining multifunctionality. Root and soil AM fungal communities were significantly different with dominance of Rhizophagus operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in roots and Claroideoglomus OTUs in soil. However, the similarity between soil and root AM fungal communities increased with livestock grazing. Correlation analysis between palatable plant biomass and relative abundance of dominant AM fungal OTUs identified indicator virtual taxa that decreased (VTX00325 in roots, and VTX00165, VTX00214, and VTX00222 in soil) or increased (VTX00100, VTX00130, and VTX00295 in soil) with grazing intensity. The OTUs that were increased by grazing may be r-selected, grazing-tolerant AM fungi that accept a low C supply and supply few nutrients to plants. Our results suggest that grassland management focusing on ecosystem-service multi functionality via control of AM plants, including S. krylovii and their co-dominant dominant AM fungi, in ungrazed grasslands are key for sustainable rangeland management in Mongolia.

AB  - In this chapter we present the current state of research on the contribution of the gut microbiome to the degradation of dietary sources of carbon in three social insects: termites, honeybees and herbivorous ants. Insects from these groups can face similar dietary challenges, and an emerging body of research illustrates that their gut microbes have provided symbiotic solutions for the degradation of a variety of carbon sources. Termites, particularly 'lower' termites have a diet enriched in perhaps the most recalcitrant molecule found in the diet of social insects-lignocellulose. Lower termites have a diverse (>400 species/gut) community of protists and bacteria that work together with endogenous host cellulases to provision acetate to the host. Honeybees, feeding on pollen, pollen-rich beebread and nectar, have a relatively simple gut microbiome (8-10 bacterial species). Recently it has been demonstrated that some of these bacteria possess pectinases and an assortment of other sugar- and flavonoid-degrading enzymes and may provision the host with several molecules, including butyrate. In leaf-cutter ants, feeding on their fungal cultivar, bacteria may be involved in the depolymerization of chitin and fermentation of citrate to acetate. In Cephalotes turtle ants, metagenomic studies have shown that some gut bacteria encode genes for the degradation of recalcitrant polysaccharides found in pollen and, possibly, other foods from their generally cryptic diets. Across these social insect hosts, faithful symbioses with specialized microbes were enabled by modifications to social behaviour that facilitated faithful spread of microbes within colonies and across generations.

AB  - Nematodes are the most abundant multi-cellular animals in soil, influencing key processes and functions in terrestrial ecosystems. Yet, little is known about the drivers of nematode abundance and diversity in forest soils across climatic zones. This is despite forests covering approximately 30% of the Earth's land surface, providing many crucial ecosystem services but strongly varying in climatic conditions and associated ecosystem properties across biogeographic zones. Here, we collected nematode samples from 13 forests across a latitudinal gradient. We divided this gradient into temperate, warm-temperate and tropical climatic zones and found that, across the gradient, nematode abundance and diversity were mainly influenced by soil organic carbon content. However, mean annual temperature and total soil phosphorus content in temperate zones, soil pH in warm-temperate zones, and mean annual precipitation in tropical zones were more important in driving nematode alpha-diversity, biomass and abundance. Additionally, nematode beta-diversity was higher in temperate than in warm-temperate and tropical zones. Together, our findings demonstrate that the drivers of nematode diversity in forested ecosystems are affected by the spatial scale and climatic conditions considered. This implies that high resolution studies are needed to accurately predict how soil functions respond if climate conditions move beyond the coping range of soil organisms.

AB  - Social wasps are widely distributed in Brazil, and their distribution is closely related to the type of habitat and vegetation structure. Veredas (palm swamps) occur on moist soils and are characterized by an almost total predominance of buriti palms (Mauritia flexuosa). The insect fauna of these environments is poorly known, especially in Central Brazil. Some data on the diversity of the social wasps are available for the state of Mato Grosso, although its Veredas have not been surveyed up to now. In the present study, we investigated the wasp species composition in six Vereda environments over a 24-month sampling period, between August 2017 and July 2019. The specimens were collected using a sweep net, which was deployed along 200-m transects that were subdivided into 10 plots of 3 m(2). To attract the wasps, we used a backpack sprayer to spray each plot with insect attractant made from five spoonfuls of granulated sugar and one spoonful of salt, dissolved in 5 liters of water. After spraying the plot, we waited 10 minutes before initiating the surveys, which lasted 10 minutes per plot, for a total of 200 minutes of sampling per palm swamp. A total of 1072 social wasp specimens were collected, representing 11 genera and 37 different species. The most abundant species were Polybia cf. ruficeps xantops (Richards, 1978), Agelaia pallipes (Olivier, 1792); Polybia rejecta (Lepeletier, 1836), and Mischocyttarus mattogrossoensis Zikan, 1935, which together accounted for 57% of the specimens collected over the 24 months of the study period. The total species richness estimated for the Vereda environments was 39.88 +/- 0.627, approximately 41% of the 88 wasp species of the subfamily Polistinae found in the Cerrado of eastern Mato Grosso.

AB  - Background. Plant litter decomposition is a key process in carbon and nutrient cycling. Among the factors determining litter decomposition rates, the role of soil biota in the decomposition of different plant litter types and its modification by variations in climatic conditions is not well understood.
   Methods. In this study, we used litterbags with different mesh sizes (45 mm, 1 mm and 4 mm) to investigate the effect of microorganisms and decomposer microarthropods on leaf and root litter decomposition along an altitudinal gradient of tropical montane rainforests in Ecuador. We examined decomposition rates, litter C and N concentrations, microbial biomass and activity, as well as decomposer microarthropod abundance over one year of exposure at three different altitudes (1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 m).
   Results. Leaf litter mass loss did not differ between the 1,000 and 2,000 m sites, while root litter mass loss decreased with increasing altitude. Changes in microbial biomass and activity paralleled the changes in litter decomposition rates. Access of microarthropods to litterbags only increased root litter mass loss significantly at 3,000 m. The results suggest that the impacts of climatic conditions differentially affect the decomposition of leaf and root litter, and these modifications are modulated by the quality of the local litter material. The findings also highlight litter quality as the dominant force structuring detritivore communities. Overall, the results support the view that microorganisms mostly drive decomposition processes in tropical montane rainforests with soil microarthropods playing a more important role in decomposing low-quality litter material.

AB  - Cultivation leads to a considerable loss of soil nutrients and microbial population. Previously, only the soil physico-chemical properties were achieved attention to assess the status of soil nutrients but nowadays, the role of soil biodiversity are also considered in sustaining the soil fertility and crop production. Therefore, the present study evaluated the impact of different land use patterns on soil health including physical, chemical and biological properties along the altitudinal gradient in Indian Central Himalaya. The soil samples were collected from five predominant agricultural land uses including (1) open cropland (OpC), (2) cropland with multiple tree species (C + mT), (3) cropland with single tree species (C + sT), (4) Homegardens (HG) and (5) Agriculturally discarded land (ADL). The various physico-chemical and biological properties of the soils were determined with the standardized methods. The physico-chemical properties showed the significant differences with land use systems and altitudinal variation. Among the different systems, the highest values of soil phosphorus and phosphorus stock were recorded in C + mT system (0.042% and 0.73 t ha(-1)) whereas lowest in ADL system (0.033% and 0.59 t ha(-1)). The range of microbial biomass phosphorus and microbial quotient varied from 18 (OpC) to 25 mu gg(-1) (C + mT) and 4.92 (OpC) to 6.18% (ADL), respectively. The highest microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) was recorded in the lower altitudinal region of Tarai and lowest was recorded in the higher altitudinal region. Across the seasons, it was maximum recorded during the rainy and minimum during the winter season. Soil MBP showed the significant correlation with altitudes, systems, abiotic variables, physico-chemical properties of soil and vegetation. This study concludes that tree based systems should be preferred as an agriculture management practices to promote microbial diversity, their activities and soil quality enhancement in the Central Himalayan region.

AB  - Brejos de Altitude are enclaves of higher altitude humid forests in the semiarid lowlands of the North-eastern of Brazil. They present unique characteristics in terms of soil and air humidity, temperature, vegetation cover, and biodiversity. Due to these conditions, many cattle ranchers and farmers develop activities that have caused habitat loss and fragmentation of biodiversity. In this study, we aimed to describe the diversity of conidial fungi that occur in the leaf litter of the riparian vegetation in a Brejo de Altitude in Pernambuco, Brazil. Decomposing leaf material was collected from the forest floor in the dry and rainy periods of 2019, incubated in moist chambers and observed daily for fungal structures, for up to 45 days, under dissecting microscope and light microscope. Eighty-four taxa of fungi were identified, totaling 335 occurrences. The air and soil temperature, and precipitation showed an influence on the fungal community. Species richness was greater in the dry period and abundance was greater in the rainy period. The multivariate analyses revealed differences in the conidial fungi community between the dry and rainy periods. A high richness of leaf litter conidial fungal was uncovered in this area of humid forest surrounded by the semiarid vegetation of Caatinga.

AB  - Simple Summary The novel use of carbon-rich biochar as a soil amendment in forest systems may be beneficial in the restoration of disturbed sites due to its ability to increase soil water holding capacity, potentially reduce drought stress in surrounding vegetation and aid in long-term carbon sequestration. As biochar is utilized in forest management, it is necessary to establish the potential effects that it may have on insects and other invertebrate assemblages. The results of recent laboratory studies demonstrate a potential for negative impacts on insects. Examining direct exposure of insects to biochar in a laboratory experiment may help us understand what effects biochar may have on insects that come into direct contact with the material. Along with direct exposure, biochar applications in the field would result in the surface and possible contamination of insect nutrient sources. To determine the impacts of ingesting biochar, we reared Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata, on synthetic diet to examine the insect's survival and longevity. The use of biochar as a soil amendment in forest ecosystems can be beneficial in the restoration of degraded soils. Forest insects such as the Douglas-fir tussock moth, Orgyia pseudotsugata (McDonnough) (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), may be exposed to biochar when the material is applied. Two experiments were conducted using biochar either (1) applied to the surface of the diet at three rates (0, 5, and 10 mg) or (2) incorporated into synthetic diet at four rates (0, 10, 20, and 40% volume/volume). The objective of both experiments was to determine if biochar on the surface or incorporated into a synthetic diet affected development and survival of O. pseudotsugata larvae. In both experiments, there was a significant decrease in estimated time to larval mortality in all biochar treatments compared to untreated controls. In the surface-applied biochar experiment, there was a significant difference in larval weight gain at day 12 between the control and 10 mg biochar treatments. In the experiment with biochar incorporated into the diet, mean larval weight at day 12 was highest in the low (10%) biochar treatment compared to all other treatments, although weight gain was only significantly different between the low- and high-concentration (40%) biochar treatments. Our results suggest that larvae, feeding on a low amount of biochar in the synthetic diet, may respond by engaging in compensatory feeding behavior. Fewer surviving larvae in the biochar treatment groups may contribute to the lack of significance found in the comparison of weight gain at day 24 in each experiment.

AB  - The effects of climate change on oaks Quercus spp. constitute a main environmental concern for the conservation of temperate forests. In this context, we assessed the consequences of longer droughts on the interactions between the holm oak Quercus ilex L. and its main acorn pests. Infested acorns were prematurely abscised before reaching their potential size. The volume of the acorns attacked by Cydia fagiglandana (Lepidoptera) was smaller than those attacked by Curculio elephas (Coleoptera); however, their weight did not differ because Curculio larvae consumed more cotyledon. For the same reason, embryo survival likelihood was not lower in Cydia acorns despite their smaller size. Delays of late summer rain reduced infestation by Curculio, as soil hardness hampers adult emergence from their underground cells. By contrast, late and scarce precipitations benefited Cydia; rainfall might hamper adult flight and eggs/L1 larvae survival. There was not a "zero-sum" effect, because the decrease of Curculio infestation rates was not fully compensated by an increase of Cydia. Under the longer droughts projected for the Mediterranean Basin, our results predict lower infestation rates and higher acorn survival likelihood. However, further studies including other environmental factors are needed to better forecast the net consequences for holm oak fitness.

AB  - Questions While positive effects of tree diversity on tree community biomass have often been reported in mature stands, the debate on whether diversity effects may be detectable at the seedling level persists, with opposing outcomes found so far. We still lack a comprehensive evaluation of the biodiversity effects (so-called 'complementarity' and 'selection' effects), as well as the phenotypic drivers at play, underlying early-community biomass. Even less is known about whether such biodiversity effects may change under water-limited conditions. Location Seeds from four tree species coexisting in a Mediterranean forest (Spain). Methods We built experimental tree seedling assemblages with three diversity levels - monocultures, two-species and four-species mixtures - and under two soil moisture conditions. We quantified the extent to which species richness, species identity, community-weighted mean (CWM) and functional dissimilarity (FD) influence complementarity and selection effects. We computed CWM and FD for seven functional traits related to water and light acquisition; and we calculated the complementarity and selection effects from above- and below-ground biomass measures at the community level. Results Our results showed that complementarity drove the greater biomass in more diverse assemblages at the seedling stage. This pattern was largely favored by a particular species, Quercus faginea, with distinct phenotypic traits (great height, lateral ramification and root biomass with high dry matter content), which induced a positive effect of CWM on community biomass. Moreover, our study showed that the water deficit limited the production of above-ground biomass without interacting with the community's species richness. Conclusion Our study provides evidence that positive biodiversity effects on community biomass occur early, at the seedling stage, and it highlights the essential role that certain tree species play from their initial development stages by favoring spatial resource partitioning. Our work motivates future studies to apply integrated approaches in assessing both the community-wide and species-specific effects to understand the biodiversity-biomass relationship.

AB  - This paper examines the chemical composition of Scots pine litterfall in north taiga pine forests in background conditions and under the impact of emissions from the Severonikel copper-nickel industrial complex. In forests exposed to industrial airborne pollution, the content of fertilizer elements (Ca, Mg, Mn, and Zn) in coniferous litterfall decreases, while the content of heavy metals (Ni and Cu) and values of stoichiometric C/P and N/P ratios increase. This indicates that the quality of plant material to be decomposed by soil biota declines. In background conditions, intrabiogeocoenotic differences in the chemical composition of coniferous litterfall are manifested in a higher content of K and P (supplied with crown and trunk waters) under tree crowns; in intercrown spaces, concentrations of Fe, Zn, Ni, and Cu are higher due to background airborne pollution. In defoliating forests, coniferous litterfall under tree crowns contains more Ca, Mg, K, Mn, P, N, and S due to the intensive leaching of fertilizer elements from tree crowns by acidic precipitation and, as in the case of sulfur, due to its inflow with acidic precipitation. The elevated content of N, P, and K in coniferous litterfall of defoliating forests can be determined by high concentrations of these mobile elements in living needles falling off ahead of normal phenological terms. In background conditions, seasonal variability of the chemical composition of coniferous litterfall in defoliating forests is manifested in high Ca and Mn concentrations in needles due to their accumulation there by the end of the warm season. In sparse technogenic forests, Mg and K accumulate in coniferous litterfall by the end of the growing season, which indicates a disturbance of retranslocation processes under the impact of pollution. In all studied pine forests, the content of Fe and Zn in litterfall significantly decreases by the end of the warm season; in forests exposed to airborne pollution, the content of Ni and Cu decreases as well. This can be explained by their antagonism with Mn and leaching from needles by acidic precipitation during the warm season.

AB  - The Neotropics is one of the most diverse regions of the globe in terms of plants and animal species. Regarding the microbial world, however, little is known about the diversity and biogeography patterns of microorganisms in the Neotropics. The biogeography of several microbial taxonomic groups is still missing and/or incomplete, such as the protists. Despite the hard taxonomic identification of protists, the advance of molecular techniques (e.g., metabarcoding) have allowed to better explore the distribution of several protistan groups. Our goal here was to summarize the available information of Neotropical protists, focusing on metabarcoding studies, to explore what these data evidence on their ecology and biogeography. For this, we reviewed the findings from all articles that focused on or included the terrestrial protists using a metabarcoding approach and identified the gaps and future perspectives in this research field. We found that Neotropical protistan diversity patterns seem to be, at least in part, congruent with that of macro-organisms and, different than plants and bacteria, just weakly explained by environmental variables. We argue that studies with standardized protocols including different ecoregions are necessary, such as temperate forests, grasslands, and savannas from Southern of SouthAmerica and NorthernAtlantic Forest, to fully characterize the ecology and biogeography on Neotropical protists. Furthermore, dismembering evolutionary lineages and functional guilds of protists are important to better understand the relationship between diversity, dispersal abilities, and functionality of particular taxa of protists in their habitats.

AB  - AimTo evaluate the interaction between climate and biome structure when explaining changes in species richness of soil-associated communities due to tree plantations developed in different biomes. Compare the response of plants, soil invertebrates and soil microorganisms, and to test whether they should be considered sensitive-coupled biotas. LocationContinental South America. Time Period1996-2023. Major Taxa StudiedPlants, soil invertebrates and soil microorganisms. MethodsThrough a meta-analysis, the change in species richness (i.e. response ratio) associated with tree plantations was evaluated in 127 points of study across South America, considering soil-associated communities of plants, invertebrates and microorganisms. The influence of biome structure (open vs. closed habitats) on the response ratio, and its interaction with the actual evapotranspiration (AET) and temperature seasonality was evaluated. Differentiated responses of different taxa were tested by comparing models with and without an interaction term referring to the taxon studied. The regional agricultural cover and plantation age were considered as anthropogenic variables. ResultsModels containing the AET were better at explaining the trend of change in species richness than those with temperature seasonality. The response of the change in species richness was oppositely related to the AET in open and closed biomes. Plants presented a higher loss in species richness than soil invertebrates and microorganisms. The three taxa were positively associated with AET, while seasonality was not relevant in any case. Both anthropogenic variables significantly lessened the change in species richness in all models. Main ConclusionsThe structural contrast between the anthropogenic habitat and the biome where it is developed is a key factor influencing the response of soil-associated communities to tree plantations. Nevertheless, its influence must be assessed together with climatic and anthropogenic variables given that their interaction can explain different geographical trends in the change in species richness across regions.

AB  - Rainforest conversion and expansion of plantations in tropical regions are associated with changes in animal communities and biodiversity decline. In soil, Collembola are one of the most numerous invertebrate groups that affect the functioning of microbial communities and support arthropod predators. Despite that, information on the impact of changes in land use in the tropics on species and trait composition of Collembola communities is very limited. We investigated the response of Collembola to the conversion of rainforest into rubber agroforestry ("jungle rubber"), rubber, and oil palm plantations in Jambi Province (Sumatra, Indonesia), a region which experienced one of the strongest recent deforestation globally. Collembola were sampled in 2013 and 2016 from the litter and soil layer using heat extraction, and environmental factors were measured (litter C/N ratio, pH, water content, composition of microbial community and predator abundance). In the litter layer, density and species richness in plantation systems were 25%-38% and 30%-40% lower, respectively, than in rainforest. However, in the soil layer, density, species richness, and trait diversity of Collembola were only slightly affected by land-use change, contrasting the response of many other animal groups. Species and trait composition of Collembola communities in litter and soil differed between each of the land-use systems. Water content and pH were identified as main factors related to the differences in species and trait composition in both litter and soil, followed by the density of micro- and macropredators. Dominant species of Collembola in rainforest and jungle rubber were characterized by small body size, absence of furca, and absence of intense pigmentation, while in plantations, larger species with long furca and diffuse or patterned pigmentation were more abundant. Overall, land-use change negatively affected Collembola communities in the litter layer, but its impact was lower in the soil layer. Several pantropical genera of Collembola (i.e., Isotomiella, Pseudosinella, and Folsomides) dominated across land-use systems, reflecting their high environmental adaptability and/or efficient dispersal, calling for studies on their ecology and genetic diversity. The decline in species richness and density of litter-dwelling Collembola with the conversion of rainforest into plantation systems calls for management practices mitigating negative effects of the deterioration of the litter layer in rubber plantations, but even more in oil palm plantations.

AB  - Globally, mountains have suffered enormous biodiversity loss and habitat degradation due to climate change and human activities. As an agent of biodiversity, evaluating habitat quality (HQ) change is an indispensable key step for regional ecological security and human well-being enhancement, especially for fragile mountain ecosystems in arid areas. In this study, we aimed to propose an integrated framework coupled with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST)-HQ module to improve the effectiveness and accuracy of HQ estimation. We highlighted the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang as an example to validate the model, as it is a typical representative of mountain ecosystems in the temperate arid zone. Specifically, we aimed to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of HQ over the past two decades and investigate its influencing factors using a geographical detector model. The results show that, first, grassland and unused land were the main land-use types in the study area. The land-use transitions were mainly concentrated in grassland, woodland, water body, and unused land. Second, the total area of very important habitats and general habitats accounted for over 70% of the Tianshan Mountains. The average HQ decreased from 0.5044 to 0.4802 during 1995-2015. Third, the HQ exhibited significant spatial differentiation, and the Ili River Valley and Kaidu River Basin were the hot spots, while the south and east of the Tianshan Mountains were the cold spots. Habitat quality was strongly related to the terrain gradient, with an inverted "U" type. Protected areas of different categories played a vital role in biodiversity conservation. Finally, soil type, land-use change, precipitation, temperature, and grazing intensity were the dominant factors in response to HQ change for both the total Tianshan Mountains and sub-regions, followed by elevation, the relief degree of the land surface, gross domestic product, population density, and distance to tourism attractions. The interaction effects of the influencing factors were improved compared to the effects of the individual factors in each zone. Furthermore, these results provide decision-making criteria for formulating a scientific and systematic protection of ecology and restoration planning systems to enhance the capacity to address climate change.

AB  - The Mediterranean Region constitutes a biodiversity hotspot and its forests have provided multiple ecosystem services (ES) to human societies for millennia. In the last decades, many Mediterranean forests have undergone a decreasing level of direct human pressure and a growing exposure to environmental stress factors (e.g. wildfires and droughts). However, the degree to which these processes have affected the provision of ES remains largely unexplored. We used an extensive database of 3417 permanent plots (period 1990-2015, 25 years) from the Spanish National Forest Inventory in Catalonia (North-Eastern Spain) and a range of four ecological models to measure and estimate changes in five different ES: wild mushrooms production, timber volume increment, water provision, carbon sequestration and erosion mitigation. We then assessed general trends in ES, their spatial-temporal patterns and searched for potential trade-offs in their delivery. Using mixed-effects models, we explored the differences among three biogeographical regions, as well as the effect of different environmental and site level drivers, including descriptors of stand structure and development, the legacies of management practices and disturbances, as well as the influence of historical climate conditions and their recent anomalies. Our results show a general decline of timber volume increment, water provision and carbon sequestration, along with an increase in erosion mitigation across inland and montane regions. Fitted model parameters suggest a predominant role of stand structure in driving changes in forest ES supply in the study area. In particular, stands with high basal areas were associated with steeper declines in most ES, whereas high mean tree diameter generally contributed to ES increases. Finally, our results showed a series of potential trade-offs among temporal changes in ES that were not reflected in exclusively static analyses, highlighting the relevance of including the temporal dimension in regional assessments of ES. Future forest management and planning could better account for overall ES value as well as expected changes in their future provision, paving the way to landscape planning that balances these two essential components of forest ES.

AB  - The 6.7 M ha Tongass National Forest in southeast Alaska, USA, supports a world-class salmon fishery, is one of the world's most intact temperate rainforests, and is recognized for exceptional levels of carbon stored in woody biomass. We quantified biomass and soil organic carbon (C) by land use designation, Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs), young and productive old-growth forests (POGs), and 77 priority watersheds. We used published timber harvest volumes (roundwood) to estimate C stock change across five time periods from early historical (1909-1951) through future (2022-2100). Total soil organic and woody biomass C in the Tongass was 2.7 Pg, representing -20% of the total forest C stock in the entire national forest system, the equivalent of 1.5 times the 2019 US greenhouse gas emissions. IRAs account for just over half the C, with 48% stored in POGs. Nearly 15% of all C is within T77 watersheds, >80% of which overlaps with IRAs, with half of that overlapping with POGs. Young growth accounted for only similar to 5% of the total C stock. Nearly two centuries of historical and projected logging would release an estimated 69.5 Mt CO 2 e, equivalent to the cumulative emissions of similar to 15 million vehicles. Previously logged forests within IRAs should be allowed to recover carbon stock via proforestation. Tongass old growth, IRAs, and priority watersheds deserve stepped-up protection as natural climate solutions.

AB  - A predictive understanding of interactions between vegetation and climate has been a grand challenge in terrestrial ecology for over 200 years. Developed in recent decades, continental-scale monitoring of climate and forest dynamics enables quantitative examination of vegetation-climate relationships through a data-driven paradigm. Here, we apply a data-intensive approach to investigate forest-climate interactions across the conterminous USA. We apply multivariate statistical methods (stepwise regression, principal component analysis) including machine learning to infer significant climatic drivers of standing forest basal area. We focus our analysis on the ecoregional scale. For most ecoregions analyzed, both stepwise regression and random forests indicate that factors related to precipitation are the most significant predictors of forest basal area. In almost half of US ecoregions, precipitation of the coldest quarter is the single most important driver of basal area. The demonstrated data-driven approach may be used to inform forest-climate envelope modeling and the forecasting of large-scale forest dynamics under climate change scenarios. These results have important implications for climate, biodiversity, industrial forestry, and indigenous communities in a changing world.

AB  - Species loss in tropical regions is forecast to occur under environmental change scenarios of low precipitation. One of the main questions is how drought will affect invertebrates, a key group for ecosystem functioning. We use 1 year of data from a long-term rainwater exclusion experiment in primary Amazonian rainforest to test whether induced water stress and covarying changes in soil moisture, soil respiration, and tree species richness, diversity, size, and total biomass affected species richness and composition (relative abundance) of ground-dwelling ants. Data on ant abundance and environmental variables were collected at two sites (control and experimental) in the Eastern Amazon. Since 2002, drought has been induced in the experimental plot by excluding 50% of normal rainfall. Ant species richness in the experiment plot was reduced and some generalist species responded positively. Ant species richness also increased in the experimental plot with increasing diversity of the plant species of the leaf litter. The relative abundance of ants differed between plots. The experimental plot was characterized by a higher frequency of generalist and other species that appeared to be favored by the reduction in rainfall. Between-plot comparisons suggested loss and changes in ant species composition in tropical forests were affected by increasing dryness. These changes could ultimately lead to cascading effects on ecosystem processes and the services they mediate.

AB  - Environmental challenges, including climate change-influenced weather extremes over the hilly region, are a major issue for the sustenance/ livelihood of Uttarakhand Himalayan biodiversity. The very high maximum temperature during summer days makes the area vulnerable to frequent forest fires, while the increasing frequency of intense rainfall proves devastating to infrastructure, croplands, and vegetation. Such erratic climate patterns make it increasingly difficult for people to live in the mountains and thus lead to climate-forced migration towards the plains. The investigation is concerned with weather/climate extremes and precisely how this affects the Himalayan people of Uttarakhand. Analysis of the extreme precipitation and temperature indicators for landslides and forest fire events has been performed. For the entire Uttarakhand region, strong declining trends have been observed for total precipitation, total runoff, soil water content, and leaf area index (LAI) for the ERA5 reanalysis datasets from 1981 to 2020 (40 years). Over central to western Uttarakhand, a consistent increase in the number of consecutive dry days is noticed both in the winter and the summer. The upper elevations of Uttarakhand nonetheless perceive days that are very wet and rainy. Over the hilly regions of Uttarakhand, elevation-dependent warming (EDW) continues to worsen climatic and weather extremes, making sustenance challenging. Over higher elevations, intense rainfall events are the main cause of landslides and flash floods. The frequency of very warm days and nights formerly increases over Uttarakhand's mountainous region, while the number of very cold days and nights declines. In the past forty years, there has been a rise in weather extremes in the Uttarakhand Himalaya. However, the community and decision-makers believe it difficult to cope with the extreme weather driven due to climate change. Thereafter, findings of this study will support in developing policies for the long-term development of Uttarakhand's mountainous regions.

AB  - Cocoa is an important crop for Ghana's economy, contributing 25% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The crop, however, is mainly cultivated on forest-derived soils and is a major cause of land-use change. Termites are an important biological component of tropical ecosystems providing numerous ecosystem services. Previous studies have indicated that termites are sensitive to forest disturbance and decrease in richness and abundance across land-use intensification gradients, with consequences for the essential services that they provide. Native shade trees are often used to improve cocoa cultivation and may reduce the detrimental effects of land-use change on some aspects of biodiversity. The aim of this study was therefore to explore how termites respond to land-use change along a shade-tree gradient in Kakum National Park and surrounding cocoa farms in Ghana (from forest at 80% tree cover to cocoa with no shade cover, to the extreme of cultivated arable crop land). It was predicted that termite richness and abundance would decrease with decreasing shade cover, and with increasing distance from the forest edge. Thirty-four species from 29 genera were sampled, with Ancistrotermes crucifer being found in all the locations (47% of all encounters). Species richness and abundance differed marginally across the land-use gradient, as well as the distance from the forest edge; however, species richness did not show any significance with distance. All the same, termite communities were robust to the disturbance. Our findings suggest that though site influenced species richness and abundance, cocoa trees can play a crucial role in maintaining biodiversity and environmental quality in an agricultural landscape by providing a habitat for forest species that are not found in pastures or farm fields. However, we caution that the relatively low forest baseline of existing forest diversity may inflate the value of cocoa land, with those forests no longer representing undisturbed natural habitats: this highlights that shifting baselines may need to be accounted for when interpreting findings in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Deforestation of native ecosystems causes microclimatic changes at the edge of the remaining forest fragments. This "edge effect" can modify soil attributes, although there is little information on this. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the edge effect on soil microclimate conditions, chemical, microbiological and arthropod community attributes and their relationship with litter attributes in a fragment of Semideciduous Seasonal Forest, in Pirai, RJ, Brazil. In the middle of the dry period (June/2019), four ranges of distances parallel to each other were established from the edge of the forest fragment: Edge: 0 m; Range 1: 50 m; Range 2: 100 m; and Interior: 160 m. In each range, five sampling points were established, spaced 10 m apart, where soil samples were collected in the 0-5 cm layer and litter samples. This material was employed to determine microclimatic, chemical and biological (arthropod community and microbiological attributes) attributes of the soil; and litter stock, concentration and content of nutrients. Forest fragmentation altered litter attributes and consequently soil moisture and nutrients, the communities' attributes of soil arthropods and microorganisms. These modifications in such aspects of nutrient cycling could compromise the forest functioning and the conservation of local biodiversity. Thus, we suggested the planting of non-pioneer native tree species in distances closest to the forest edge and installing of ecological corridors to connect the forest fragment to other remnants, in order to diminish the edge effect.

AB  - Aim: Fires can severely impact aquatic fauna, especially when attributes of soil, topography, fire severity and post-fire rainfall interact to cause substantial sedimentation. Such events can cause immediate mortality and longer-term changes in food resources and habitat structure. Approaches for estimating fire impacts on terrestrial species (e.g. intersecting fire extent with species distributions) are inappropriate for aquatic species as sedimentation can carry well downstream of the fire extent, and occur long after fire. Here, we develop an approach for estimating the spatial extent of fire impacts for aquatic systems, across multiple catchments.
   Location: Southern Australian bioregions affected by the fires in 2019-2020 that burned >10 million ha of temperate and subtropical forests.
   Methods: We integrated an existing soil erosion model with fire severity mapping and rainfall data to estimate the spatial extent of post-fire sedimentation threat in waterways and in basins and the potential exposure of aquatic species to this threat. We validated the model against field observations of sedimentation events after the 2019-20 fires.
   Results: While fires overlapped with similar to 27,643 km of waterways, post-fire sedimentation events potentially occurred across similar to 40,449 km. In total, 55% (n =85) of 154 basins in the study region may have experienced substantial post-fire sedimentation. Ten species-including six Critically Endangered-were threatened by post-fire sedimentation events across 100% of their range. The model increased the estimates for potential impact, compared to considering fire extent alone, for >80% of aquatic species. Some species had distributions that did not overlap with the fire extent, but that were entirely exposed to post-fire sedimentation threat.
   Conclusions: Compared with estimating the overlap of fire extent with species' ranges, our model improves estimates of fire-related threats to aquatic fauna by capturing the complexities of fire impacts on hydrological systems. The model provides a method for quickly estimating post-fire sedimentation threat after future fires in any fire-prone region, thus potentially improving conservation assessments and informing emergency management interventions.

AB  - Canopy soils can be important to forest nutrient cycling, hydrology, and biodiversity, but the factors determining their distribution and properties are largely unknown. We surveyed canopy soils across gradients of temperature and precipitation in six primary forests in Costa Rica. We used solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) to understand how the composition of canopy soil organic matter varies within and across sites. Climate, particularly fog, appears to drive canopy soil abundance across forests, while tree size determines canopy soil abundance within a forest. Canopy soil chemistry mostly varied within sites, though temperature was associated with the carbon (C) to nitrogen ratio, total dissolved nitrogen, and alkyl-C abun-dance, while fog explained some of the variation in dissolved organic carbon and O-alkyl C abundance. This study is the first-ever glimpse into large-and small-scale drivers of canopy soil abundance and biochemical composition. Our results highlight the importance of tree size and fog in determining the quantity and quality of canopy soil organic matter, suggesting that canopy soil stocks may be particularly vulnerable to climate and land use change. Identifying how multi-scale factors influence canopy organic matter processes will enhance our ability to identify and predict how environmental change might affect the abundance and chemistry of canopy soils and thus biodiversity that they support.

AB  - The productivity of herbaceous and understory woody vegetation is critical for wildlife habitat, livestock forage, and biodiversity, and is influenced by both annual weather patterns and tree dominance. With the goals to inform management and understand climate change implications, we determined the effects of tree harvest, prescribed fire, and 31 yr of climate variability on understory aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) for ecosystems ranging from mature forest to grassland in a long-term study in southeastern Oklahoma, USA. In 1984, starting with a mature forest dominated by Pinus echinata and Quercus stellata, replicated experimental units were created by various combinations of pine harvest, hardwood thinning, and subsequent fire return intervals (1-4 yr and none). Understory ANPP (forbs, grasses, and woody plants) was measured by clip plots at the end of each growing season. Stepwise regression models were developed between understory ANPP and tree basal area, litter accumulation, fire return interval, and monthly, seasonal, and annual weather variables. Understory ANPP was dominated by grasses and ranged from 27 g center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) for the mature forest to 374 g center dot m(-2)center dot yr(-1) for an annually burned grassland/savanna. In general, herbaceous ANPP was inversely related to tree dominance (basal area), litter accumulation, and early and late growing season temperatures, and positively related to June precipitation. Understory woody ANPP was influenced by tree basal area, positively influenced by precipitation, and negatively influenced by summer soil moisture deficits. Our results indicate that prescribed fire, through its negative influence on tree basal area and litter accumulation, is critical to maintaining highly productive understories and that a three-year return interval is a threshold to stall redevelopment of forest. For herbaceous ANPP, timing of precipitation, especially mid-growing season, appears more important than total precipitation, and higher temperatures within the range our site experienced did not have a large negative effect. In contrast, understory woody ANPP was negatively influenced by drought indicating climate change may have variable effects on different functional groups.

AB  - Background Anthropogenic disturbances are increasingly affecting the vitality of tropical dry forests. The future condition of this important biome will depend on its capability to resist and recover from these disturbances. So far, the temporal stability of dryland forests is rarely studied, even though identifying the important factors associated with the stability of the dryland forests could serve as a basis for forest management and restoration. Methodology In a degraded dry Afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, we explored remote sensing derived indicators of forest stability, using MODIS satellite derived NDVI time series from 2001 to 2018. Resilience and resistance were measured using the anomalies (remainders) after time series decomposition into seasonality, trend and remainder components. Growth stability was calculated using the integral of the undecomposed NDVI data. These NDVI derived stability indicators were then related to environmental factors of climate, topography, soil, tree species diversity, and local human disturbance, obtained from a systematic grid of field inventory plots, using boosted regression trees in R. Results Resilience and resistance were adequately predicted by these factors with an R-2 of 0.67 and 0.48, respectively, but the model for growth stability was weaker. Precipitation of the wettest month, distance from settlements and slope were the most important factors associated with resilience, explaining 51% of the effect. Altitude, temperature seasonality and humus accumulation were the significant factors associated with the resistance of the forest, explaining 61% of the overall effect. A positive effect of tree diversity on resilience was also important, except that the impact of species evenness declined above a threshold value of 0.70, indicating that perfect evenness reduced the resilience of the forest. Precipitation of the wettest month was the most important factor explaining 43.52% of the growth stability variation. Conclusion A combination of climate, topographic factors and local human disturbance controlled the stability of the dry forest. Also tree diversity is an important stability component that should be considered in the management and restoration programs of such degraded forests. If local disturbances are alleviated the recovery time of dryland forests could be shortened, which is vital to maintain the ecosystem services these forests provide to local communities and global climate change.

AB  - In stands dominated by Scots pine in Central European nutrient-poor sandy forest sites, deterioration of pine health due to recent development in climate change has been observed, whereas the vitality of the Norway spruce growing in the lower storey of such stands has remained stable. The study aims to analyse the impact of the spruce lower storey on pine increments and performance in relation to drought stress. Wood core samples were collected using an increment borer from mature pines growing in deep, sandy soils with ground water at a depth that was unreachable by the roots in three plot pairs (blocks) consisting of a pine-spruce plot and a plot with the lower-storey spruce removed. The increments of earlywood and latewood were measured separately. Health status and soil moisture were also evaluated. Spruce removal increased the radial growth (tree ring width - TRW) of the pines, and this manifested earlier in the latewood. Spruce removal significantly changed relationship of TRW and umbrothermic index of released pines. The treatment also increased pine foliation, while increases of topsoil moisture in the transects were insignificant. The study indirectly proves the existence of interspecies competition in the rooting zone for water in soils where the ground water is unreachable by the roots. The flat root system of spruce creates a barrier that reduces the amount of water available for pines with deeper growing roots. To reduce the risk of the negative impact of unfavourable climate change on pine as the target species in commercial mature mixed pine forests with similar site and stand conditions, lower-storey spruce reduction can be recommended, even though this might locally and temporarily lessen the biodiversity of the forest stand.

AB  - Global changes, e.g. global warming, elevated nitrogen deposition, and shifts of precipitation regime, exert a major influence on forests via affecting plant water use efficiency (WUE) and plant nitrogen (N) availability. Large-scale ecological sampling can help us to better understand variation across regions and provide opportunities to investigate the potential impacts of multiple aspects of global change on forest ecosystem responses. Here, we determine the geographical patterns of key isotopic measures of ecosystem function-plant WUE (calculated from foliar delta C-13 values) and plant N availability (assessed by foliar delta N-15 values)-across China's forests covering similar to 21 latitude (similar to 22-43 degrees N) and similar to 28 longitude (similar to 93-121 degrees E) degree, and investigate how a suite of soil, plant, and atmospheric factors regulate them. We found that plant WUE increased but N availability decreased with latitude, while plant WUE and N availability did not vary with longitudinal gradient. Different factors regulate the large-scale patterns in WUE and N availability. The mean annual temperature, atmospheric N deposition, and soil water content exhibit considerable effects on plant WUE over both the north-to-south and east-to-west transects, while the mean annual precipitation, soil potassium content, foliar N, and precipitation seasonality considerably affect the latitudinal patterns of plant N availability. In addition, the east-to-west spatial pattern in plant N availability is associated with the variation in solar radiation. Our results suggest that key forest ecological functions respond to an array of environmental factors, and imply that changes in many different environmental attributes need to be considered in order to successfully assess plant WUE and N availability responses to global changes this century.

AB  - The rapid land use change in tropical forests is a severe threat to Earth nature's contributions to people (NCPs) and biodiversity. Effectively conserving ecosystems is a global target that requires clearly prioritizing areas that provide multiple benefits. The goal of this study is to identify potential NCPs and biodiversity hotspots of forest and evaluate their single and multiple representativeness within the Protection Areas (PA) in Peru. To do so we (1) analyzed the spatial distribution of three NCPs indicators at national and regional scales (carbon stock and sequestration in two components aboveground carbon density and soil organic carbon stock, water balance and erosion control) and one biodiversity indicator (biodiversity relative priority index) and identified their hotspots areas; (2) identified the single and overlapped hotspot areas within PAs; (3) identified synergies and trade-off among indicators. Our analysis shows that the distribution of NCPs and biodiversity varied across regions. Most hotspot areas were in the High and Not Flooded Rainforest regions due to favorable conditions for vegetation and lower levels of anthropic transformation. We found that the current PAs inadequately protect a significant percentage of hotspots, with few overlap areas. Synergies may shift to trade-offs at different scales or among regions, meaning a conservation plan solely focused on biodiversity cannot adequately preserve NCPs. Furthermore, multiple hotspot areas cannot be conserved in a single location, emphasizing the importance of hotspot identification as the first step towards achieving multifunctional PAs. Our analysis offers recommendations for achieving multifunctional PAs that can apply to megadiverse countries. (c) 2023 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecol dgica e Conservacao.

AB  - The QBS-ar (Biological Quality of Soil, based on arthropods) index was applied in Coyhaique National Reserve (Chile). The aims of our research were to assess the abundance and diversity of soil microarthropods in different South American habitats, evaluating to what extent chemical parameters and seasonal changes of weather conditions can affect these organisms. Moreover we wanted to verify if the QBS-ar index was applicable in the Neotropical biogeographic region in order to distinguish between habitats subject to different levels and types of disturbance. Therefore, four habitats were investigated: primary native Nothofagus spp. forest (OG), native forest of secondary growth after fires (SG), reforestation pine forest (PI) and anthropogenic grassland (PR). During each of seven sampling sessions (nearly one every 10 days) between October and December 2017, five 1 liter soil cores were collected in each habitat. Microarthropods extracted by means of Berlese-Tullgren funnels were counted, identified to the order level and evaluated based on their morphological adaptation to life in soil in order to assess QBS-ar values and related quality classes. Both microarthropod communities and QBS-ar values comparisons showed that OG and SG forests are close to each other, and the same is true for PI and PR. Soils of the former couple of habitats were characterized by a much higher biological quality level with QBS-ar values of 129.1 +/- 20.2 and 111.8 +/- 6.4, respectively, both corresponding to the quality class 6 (out of a maximum of 7). On the contrary, PI and PR scored QBS-ar values of 83 +/- 13.5 and 80.3 +/- 10.8, respectively, and quality classes ranged between 3 and 4. Relationships among dominant and subdominant microarthropod taxa and environmental variables were analysed. In particular some chemical properties of soils (pH, CaCO3, N-t, soluble P, exchangeable K, organic matter, C/N ratio) and weather variables (cumulated rainfalls and mean temperatures during the 7 days before each sampling session) were considered. This is the first time the QBS-ar index has been applied in the Southern Hemisphere. Our results seem to indicate this index can be "exported" also to South America, resulting a useful tool for a user friendly assessment of the impact on terrestrial environments by different forms of disturbances and of habitat management.

AB  - Microbial biodiversity parameters for tropical rainforests remain poorly understood. Whilst the soil microbiome accounts up to 95% of the total diversity of microorganisms in terrestrial ecosystems, the microbiome of suspended soils formed by vascular epiphytes remains completely unexplored. Samples of ground and suspended soils were collected in Cat Tien National Park, southern Vietnam. DNA extraction and sequencing were performed, and libraries of 16s rDNA gene sequences were analyzed. Alpha diversity indices of the microorganisms were the highest in the forest ground soil. In general, the microbiological diversity of all the soil types was found to be similar at the phylum level. Taxonomic composition of the bacterial communities in the suspended soils of plants from the same species are not closer than the taxonomic compositions of the communities in the suspended soils of different plant species. However, the beta diversity analysis revealed significant differences in the movement of mineral elements in terrestrial versus suspended soils. Our data showed that the suspended soils associated with vascular epiphytes were a depository of unique microbiological biodiversity. A contributing factor was the presence of large amounts of organic matter in the suspended soils-deposits collected by the epiphytes-which would have been degraded by termites if it had reached the ground. Further, the nutrient content of the suspended soils was prime for soil respiration activity and taxonomic microbial community biodiversity.

AB  - This study reviews and synthesizes information regarding swamps exposed to permanent waterlogging throughout the two Brazilian biodiversity hotspots: the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest. Our aims were to answer the following questions related to tree composition in these swamps: i) how do climatic and geographical variation influence the similarity and diversity of the swamps? ii) which are the most common species and how do they differ between the hotspots? iii) what is the floristic similarity between the swamps? and iv) what are the threats to which the forests are exposed? Diversity is related to variations in rainfall and temperature that are influenced both by distance from the Atlantic Ocean and altitude. Although sharing key species, the species composition of the swamps shows greater similarity with their surrounding biome than with each other. Swamps are mainly threatened by logging and fragile conservation policies. At least 11 species occurring in this plant community are endangered, reinforcing the need for stricter conservation measures. We offer an updated list of species occurrence and identify species that are the most characteristic of swamp vegetation.

AB  - The ribbon-like pine forests of North Kazakhstan represent the principal territorial intrazonal and azonal biotopes. Integrated bio-geographic studies of the pine forests' status were performed in the Beskaragai and Chaldai Nature Reserves in the Pri-Irtysh River basin within, at present, the climate-change most susceptible transitional parkland-steppe zone of Central Asia, adjoining the West Siberian Lowland. The investigations followed the regional topographic gradient with a series of mapped sites characterizing the spatial relief patterns of the pristine forest distribution and the associated phytocenoses. The results revealed marked natural arboreal cover restoration differences between the geographically close upland and lowland forest ecosystems. The regional tree growth dynamics show the varying intensity of the pine seedlings' succession, the tree stands' biomass productivity and the environmental stability, weakened by the extreme continentality and progressing aridification along with adverse anthropogenic ecological impacts. The specific geomorphic, soil and hydrological conditions are the principal determining factors. The more vital plain and lowland pine forests host the floristically richer fescue-dominated communities compared to the more fragile and precipitation-poorer upland pine settings. The latter forest ecosystems display a higher vulnerability to the current climate change, generating tree drying, forest fires, and to modern human activities such as logging, herding and recreation. The research conclusions provide new insights on the natural ribbon-like pine forests' sustainability and adaptation to the ongoing continental warming triggering fundamental environmental transformations in Central Asia's parklands.

AB  - Urbanization-induced environmental changes such as habitat fragmentation impact arthropod assemblages and food web-related ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling and energy fluxes. Yet, we lack insight into how arthropod food webs are structured along urban fragmentation gradients. Here, we investigated the community composition and food web structure of litter-dwelling arthropods along fragmentation gradients (green median strip, i.e. green fragments in the middle of roads, urban park, urban forest and natural forest) in Xiamen City, southeast China. We found the density of litter-dwelling arthropods in median strips and urban parks to be two to four times higher than in urban and natural forests, with, as indicated by literature-based stable isotope values, 67%-68% of the individuals comprising primary consumers (trophic level I). Consequently, more complex food webs were found in small urban fragments (i.e., green median strip and urban park) than in the other fragments studied, including higher linkage density and higher energy flux. The biomass of litter on the floor was significantly correlated with the density of arthropods of trophic levels I, III and IV, and each trophic guild positively correlated with each other pointing to the dominance of bottom-up forces. Overall, our results suggest that small urban fragments maintain a high density of arthropods forming complex food webs and thereby may contribute to maintaining high energy fluxes and providing important ecosystem functions in urban areas.

AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado is a biodiversity hotspot characterized by a mosaic of phytophysiognomies and soil types. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are important components of biodiversity, participating in symbiotic relationships with plants and involved in ecosystem functioning. Variations in the AMF communities in Cerrado phytophysiognomies are not well understood. We collected soil samples in the dry, transition (dry to rainy), and rainy seasons to evaluate relationships between the AMF community, vegetation, and soil physicochemical parameters of three Cerrado phytophysiognomies that constitute a structural gradient (campo sujo: grassland, cerrado tipico: savanna, and cerradao: forest) across seasons. The floristic similarity was high between cerrado grassland and savanna, but lower between cerrado forest and grassland and between cerrado forest and savanna. Twenty-six AMF species were identified, with genera Glomus and Acaulospora common to all phytophysiognomies. AMF communities showed low similarity between different phytophysiognomies. Spore density differed between the phytophysiognomies, increasing from grassland to cerrado forest. Seasonal distribution of precipitation affected the AMF community in cerrado savanna and forest, but not in grassland soil. Differences in edaphic factors were important drivers of AMF spore density that correlated positively with soil parameters. Except for woody plant biomass, which correlated positively with spore density in the dry and transition/rainy season, no vegetation parameters showed significant correlations with spore density in any season. Despite the high floristic similarity between cerrado grassland and savanna, similarity between AMF communities is low, highlighting the importance of the vegetation gradient and its conservation in the structuring of these fungal communities.

AB  - Much of the lowland tropical forests in the Solomon Islands have been heavily logged. However, little is known about the recovery status of these forests. We examined factors that influenced the recovery of forest structural attributes within 50 years after selective logging on Kolombangara Island in the western Solomon Islands. Twelve study sites-six logged and six unlogged-were identified across the Island, with two logged sites in each of three recovery-time classes: 10, 30, and 50 years after logging. Within each study site, 12 0.1-ha plots were randomly established, and a series of forest attributes measured in each plot. Our results revealed that local logging intensity and soil attributes have stronger influence on forest-structural recovery than do site attributes such as local topography or tree architecture. Furthermore, half a century of regeneration following logging is insufficient to permit full recovery of forest structure. We conclude that logged forests on Kolombangara and possibly across the Solomon Islands may not fully recover structurally before the next logging cycle, in the absence of a policy on re-entry harvesting. The development of such a policy coupled with robust forest-management measures is pivotal to facilitating sustainable logging while supporting biodiversity conservation in the Solomon Islands. This may be the last best hope for saving lowland forests and their biodiversity on this unique tropical archipelago.

AB  - Many plants depend on animals for seed dispersal, and ants commonly fill this role. We examined whether heterogeneity in ant community composition among sites, between above- and belowground foraging guilds, or between seasons predicts observed variation in seed removal rates for 12 nonmyrmecochorous Neotropical pioneer tree species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We also investigated whether ants associated with removing seeds differed in specific morphological characters from the larger ant community. We observed ant-seed interactions at caches to determine which ants removed seeds of 12 tree species. We also sampled ant community composition by placing 315 pitfall traps and 160 subterranean traps across the five sites where seed removal rates were quantified. Aboveground ant community composition varied by site but not season. Among-site variation in ant composition did not predict seed removal patterns at these same sites. Belowground ant communities differed from aboveground ant communities but were not structured by either site or seed cache type. Finally, ants that removed seeds did not differ morphologically from the broader ant community. Overall, our results suggest ant communities vary over relatively small spatial scales but exhibit a high degree of functional redundancy in terms of seed removal services provided for Neotropical pioneer tree species.

AB  - Soil phototrophic microbes play key roles in many ecosystem functions, including nutrient cycling, water absorption and retention, substrate weathering and soil stabilization, as well as colonization and persistence of other organisms. Knowledge about the diversity and biomass of soil phototrophs remains limited, especially in tropical forests and savannas. Here, we investigate changes in the diversity and abundance of soil phototrophs across the 4-km elevation gradient on Mt. Cameroon, Africa, from tropical forests (0-2300 m) to treeless savanna (2300-3600 m) and afroalpine vegetation (3600-4000 m). We evaluated the role of soil chemistry and vegetation cover in shaping phototrophic diversity patterns using soil, tree and herb census data from 224 permanent plots. Cyanobacteria from Chroococcales accounted for 65% of the species richness and > 70% of the biovolume. The highest phototrophic diversity and biovolume were recorded in treeless savanna and afroalpine vegetation, and lowest values in mid-elevation tropical forests with dense understory vegetation and hence limited light availability. Higher diversity and biovolume of soil phototrophs were associated with less productive, well-illuminated soils with lower organic matter and nitrogen content and higher pH, phosphorus and cation content. Changes in microbial richness and biovolume across tropical forests showed a U-shaped elevation pattern, with higher values recorded in coastal and lowland forests up to 1000 m elevation, the lowest values in the mid-elevation open-canopy forests with dense understory vegetation caused by disturbances of forest elephants and higher values again in montane forests between 1800 and 2200 m. Above the tree line, soil phototrophic biovolume also showed a U-shaped elevation pattern, with lower richness recorded in compact grasslands between 2700 and 3400 m. At lower-elevation savanna, soil phototrophs are indirectly supported by regular fires during the dry season, which reduces plant cover and increases soil phosphorus and cations, while barren lava fields at higher elevations around the summit support soil phototrophs directly via increased soil P and K content and indirectly by inhibiting plant growth and vegetation cover. Our results shed light on an overlooked part of soil biodiversity in major tropical ecosystems and uncover the role of various ecological filters in structuring phototrophic microbial communities in tropical soils.

AB  - Soils harbor highly diverse microbial communities that are critical to soil health, but agriculture has caused extensive land use conversion resulting in negative effects on critical ecosystem processes. However, the responses and adaptations of microbial communities to land use conversion have not yet been understood. Here, we examined the effects of land conversion for long-term crop use on the network complexity and stability of soil microbial communities over 19 months. Despite reduced microbial biodiversity in comparison with native tallgrass prairie, conventionally tilled (CT) cropland significantly increased network complexity such as connectivity, connectance, average clustering coefficient, relative modularity, and the number of species acting at network hubs and connectors as well as resulted in greater temporal variation of complexity indices. Molecular ecological networks under CT cropland became significantly more robust and less vulnerable, overall increasing network stability. The relationship between network complexity and stability was also substantially strengthened due to land use conversion. Lastly, CT cropland decreased the number of relationships between network structure and environmental properties instead being strongly correlated to management disturbances. These results indicate that agricultural disturbance generally increases the complexity and stability of species "interactions", possibly as a trade-off for biodiversity loss to support ecosystem function when faced with frequent agricultural disturbance.

AB  - Aim Ecological strategies are the growth and survival tactics employed by species in response to various environmental conditions. We aimed to identify the abiotic drivers for variation in ecological strategies of species in forest vegetation across different climatic zones. Methods We established 50 0.04-ha forest dynamics plots in each of four forest vegetation types across different climatic zones respectively. Three leaf functional traits (leaf area, specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) of woody plant species and 7 soil factors were sampled and measured. Based on competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) theory and the CSR ordination method (StrateFy), we classified plants into four groups according to their ecological strategies. Redundancy analysis was used to access the key drivers of variation in plant ecological strategies across different forest types. Results The proportion of C-strategists decreased with increasing latitude, from tropical to cold-temperate forests. Except for the tropical forest, the proportion of S-strategists increased while that of Int-strategists (the intermediate type of strategy between the competitor, stress-tolerator, and ruderal strategies) decreased with increasing latitude. Ten abiotic variables (soil pH, available phosphorus, available nitrogen, precipitation of the warmest quarter, temperature seasonality, annual temperature range, precipitation of the wettest month, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, elevation, and precipitation of the driest month) were significantly correlated with plant ecological strategies of species in different forest types. Conclusions Contrary to our expectation, soil nutrients were more important than seasonal climatic factors in determining the ecological strategies of species in forests across different climatic zones.

AB  - Climate change creates a big challenge for forest science. One of several problems calling for urgent solution concerns the elaboration of the scientific foundations for determination of the species composition of forest stands under changing environmental conditions. This problem is particularly acute in case of declining Norway spruce stands in the Sudety Mountains (SW Poland). The paper presents the main principles used to develop a model allowing determination of the most desirable species composition for any given forest stand occurring in the Sudety region. These principles include: 1) an assumption that a basis for species composition planning should be a forest site type, corrected by means of site index of the currently existing forest stand, 2) a supposition that one should broadly consider present processes taking place in Sudety stands, particularly, an intense forest dieback caused by recurring drought periods and strong winds, 3) a postulate that one should consider the differences between tree species in respect to their reaction to particular abiotic factors, 4) an assumption that majority of stands should consist of several different tree species, 5) an assumption that introducing on a wide scale Douglas fir, well-adapted to the conditions of the Sudety Mountains, is allowed, 6) an idea that one should take into account differentiated production potential and varied timber quality of particular tree species, 7) an assumption that one should consider the main features of topography (altitude, exposition, slope) as well as 8) fine elements of micro-topographical situation, as a basis for introduction of different tree species. The results obtained by means of the model based on the above mentioned principles are presented on the example of two forest districts: Ladek-Zdroj (fig. 4a, b) and Szklarska Poreba (fig. 5a, b). In both cases, a necessity to diminish the share of Norway spruce and to increase the share of such species like common beech, silver fir, Douglas fir and European larch is demonstrated. One may expect that projected compositions, taking into account the most appropriate tree species and their most suitable localizations, will allow establishment of forest stands which will be more resistant to drought and wind and, thus, will be more able to fulfill several important forest functions (related to water and soil protection, protection of forest biodiversity and timber production).

AB  - Meconopsis punicea is an iconic ornamental and medicinal plant whose natural habitat has degraded under global climate change, posing a serious threat to the future survival of the species. Therefore, it is critical to analyze the influence of climate change on possible distribution of M. punicea for conservation and sustainable utilization of this species. In this study, we used MaxEnt ecological niche modeling to predict the potential distribution of M. punicea under current and future climate scenarios in the southeastern margin region of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Model projections under current climate show that 16.8% of the study area is suitable habitat for Meconopsis. However, future projections indicate a sharp decline in potential habitat for 2050 and 2070 climate change scenarios. Soil type was the most important environmental variable in determining the habitat suitability of M. punicea, with 27.75% contribution to model output. Temperature seasonality (16.41%), precipitation of warmest quarter (14.01%), and precipitation of wettest month (13.02%), precipitation seasonality (9.41%) and annual temperature range (9.24%) also made significant contributions to model output. The mean elevation of suitable habitat for distribution of M. punicea is also likely to shift upward in most future climate change scenarios. This study provides vital information for the protection and sustainable use of medicinal species like M. punicea in the context of global environmental change. Our findings can aid in developing rational, broad-scale adaptation strategies for conservation and management for ecosystem services, in light of future climate changes.

AB  - Background: Efforts to alleviate the negative effects of oil spills in the Ecuadorian Amazon include remediation activities such as cleaning, reshaping, and revegetation of polluted areas. However, studies of the diversity of biological communities in these hydrocarbon-degraded ecosystems have never been carried out. Here, we evaluated the diversity of dung beetles on remediated soil ecosystems (Agricultural Soils and Sensitive Ecosystems) and on non-contaminated soils (Natural Forests and Palm Plantations).Methodology: The study was conducted in Sucumbios and Orellana provinces, in the Ecuadorian Amazon at four sampling sites per ecosystem type (a total of 16 sites). At each sampling site, six pitfall traps remained active for 120 consecutive h per month for 1 year.Results: We collected 37 species and 7,506 individuals of dung beetles. We observed significant differences in mean species abundance, richness, and diversity between non-contaminated soil ecosystems and remediated soil ecosystems, with Natural Forests presenting the highest values, and Agricultural Soils the lowest values. Regarding sampling month, we also found significant differences among ecosystems, which were also higher in Natural Forests.Discussion: The results suggest that hydrocarbon-degraded ecosystems tend to conserve lower beetle diversity one year after remediation highlighting the importance of Natural Forests for the conservation of tropical biodiversity. Therefore, dung beetle diversity could be used for future landscape management of these hydrocarbon-degraded ecosystems.

AB  - Larix gmelinii forest is one of the most important cold-temperate conifer forests which plays a crucial role on national ecological security in China. Understory plants of Larix gmelinii forest has different distribution and ecological strategy. This paper quantitatively explored the relationship between community composition and environmental factors in natural Larix gmelinii forest in Northeast China. The regional sample plots (n=175, size=30 mx30 m) were classified into 6 plant associations by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), and different plant associations showed different habitat preferences. Species richness and diversity showed a similar trend. Both of them had significantly negative correlation with elevation, isothermality, temperature seasonality, showing significantly positive correlation with mean annual temperature and annual precipitation. Species evenness had significantly negative correlation with mean annual temperature and annual precipitation, showing significant positive correlation with elevation and isothermality. Species richness and diversity in Asso.II (Larix gmelinii-Spiraea chamaedryfolia + Corylus heterophylla-Eriophorum vaginatum) and Asso.VI (Larix gmelinii-Carex Larix gmelinii-Sorbaria sorbifolia-Geranium wilfordii) showed higher index than others. However, species evenness in Asso.III (Larix gmelinii-Ledum palustre+Vaccinium vitis-idaea-Deyeuxia angustifolia) and Asso.IV (Larix gmelinii-Rhododendron dauricum-Pyrola dahurica) showed higher index than others. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) claimed that mean annual temperature, annual precipitation and elevation were primary environmental factors affecting species association distribution. The study can be used as a reference for Larix gmelinii forest ecosystem protection and a theoretical basis for scientifically sustainable management in similar areas.

AB  - The Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTF) present very high biodiversity and a number of tree species that are adapted to prolonged periods of water stress. Considering tree ring formation is mainly driven by seasonal variation in precipitation in tropical environments, tree-ring studies from STDF can provide important contributions to understanding how these forests are responding to climate variations. In the present study, we demonstrate the influence of edaphoclimatic variables (precipitation, air temperature and soil water deficitSWD) and the ocean teleconnections (Tropical Southern Atlantic-TSA, Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation-AMO, Western Hemisphere Warm Pool-WHWP and El Nino 3.4) on Cedrela odorata L. growth from a SDTF of northeastern Brazil. We used standard dendrochronological methods to develop an 89-year-long ring-width index chronology. The climate sensitivity of C. odorata was assessed through Pearson's correlation tests and linear regressions, which allowed to identify the determinant months (cause-effect) of each variable on the chronology. Tree growth was positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with air temperature and SWD, particularly during the rainy season (March to August). In parallel, we identified that extremely dry years can contribute to missing rings, exposing the lack of growth in C. odorata caused by water stress. Among the oceanic variables, all of them showed a negative effect on radial growth of C. odorata, except for TSA, which had no significant effect. Tree growth is constrained in years with strong El Nin tilde o and high values of AMO index during the rainy months (May, June and October). However, the WHWP showed a more pronounced negative effect in the beginning of the dry season (September). Our findings add valuable information on C. odorata responses to hydrological seasonality from SDTF and the fluctuations in oceanic teleconnections, which in turn, influence the rainfall dynamics in northeastern Brazil.

AB  - Patterns of the phylogenetic structure have been broadly applied to predict community assembly processes. However, the distribution pattern of evolutionary diversity and its drivers under nature conservation are still poorly understood in boreal forests. Here, we investigated 1738 sampling plots and subplots from distinct protection intensities (PIs) zones in five representative National Nature Reserves (NNRs). Multiple comparisons, redundancy analysis, and linear mixed model were performed to identify the changes in community phylogeny across different PIs and NNRs and the drivers for these variations. Our results showed considerable plant community phylogeny variations in different NNRs. As indicated by SesMPD (standardized mean pairwise distance) and SesMNTD (standardized the mean nearest taxon distance), trees, shrubs, and herbs presented overdispersed, clustered, and random distribution patterns, respectively, in different PIs. Protection resulted in the phylogenetic structure between the nearest species of trees showing a more overdispersed pattern (p < 0.05). Protection decreased the phylogenetically clustered degree between the nearest spe-cies of shrubs (p > 0.05), while the herbs still maintained a random pattern. Community traits explained the most to phylogeny variation of different communities (24 %-71 %, p < 0.01), followed by geoclimatic factors (2 %-24 %) and conservation processes (1 %-21 %). The higher mean annual precipitation and under branch height at the lower latitude area accompanied the higher SesMPD and SesMNTD. The higher PIs attended with higher tree SesMPD, and the longer protection time resulted in higher shrub PSR (phylogenetic species richness) and PSV (phylogenetic species variability). Including the location of NNRs, community traits, and years of protection, rather than only emphasizing PI itself, could optimize community phylogenetic structure and preserve the evolutionary potential of biodiversity.

AB  - The ongoing climate change have multi-faceted effects not only on metabolism of plants, but also on the soil properties and mycorrhizal fungal community. Under climate change the stability of the entire forest ecosystems and the carbon balance depend to a large degree on the interactions between trees and mycorrhizal fungi. The main drivers of climate change are CO2 enrichment, temperature rise, altered precipitation patterns, increased N deposition, soil acidification and pollutants, ecosystem fragmentation and habitat loss, and biotic invasion. These drivers can impact mycorrhizal community directly and indirectly. We discussed the influence of each driver on mycorrhizal community and outlined how mycorrhizas play an important role in the resilience and recovery of forest ecosystems under climate change, by mitigating detrimental effects of CO2 enrichment, temperature rise, drought, lack of nutrients, soil acidification, pollutants, pests, and diseases. Conservation of the overall biodiversity in forest ecosystems as well as providing the most favourable conditions for the development of mycorrhizae can contribute to increasing the resilience of forest ecosystems to climate change.

AB  - Stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) has been cultivated since centuries in Mediterranean areas for its products and economic benefits, including edible pine nuts, timber, mushrooms, firewood, and grazing. However, current management objectives of stone pine stands also include recreational use, biodiversity conservation, protection from soil erosion, and CO2 fixation. Stone pine stands are considered to be among the ecosystems most vulnerable to climate change, and the current increase in drought frequency in the Mediterranean Basin has been shown to negatively impact their long-term establishment. Understanding the effects of climate change on the distribution, tree-ring growth and water use of stone pine forests can help assessing the adaptive capacity of the species, and developing management programs aimed at its conservation. This paper reviews the impacts of climate change on stone pine in the Mediterranean region. The high sensitivity of stone pine to climate change has been widely demonstrated in that: (i) climatic models predict the loss of suitable habitats and the shift of its geographical distribution in the next future; (ii) tree-ring analysis showed that winter and spring rainfalls have positive effects on growth, whereas high spring temperature has a negative effect; (iii) the strategy of stone pine to cope with water deficit affects the processes regulating its growth, including wood formation, leading to peculiar tree-ring anatomical features such as intra-annual density fluctuations. The silvicultural interventions and the most effective management strategies for stone pine forests are reviewed and discussed in the context of current climate change in the Mediterranean Basin.

AB  - Scree forests with large numbers of protected plants and wildlife are seriously threatened by climate change due to more frequent drought episodes, which cause challenges for very stony, shallow soils. The effect of environmental factors on the radial growth of five tree species-European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), and mountain elm (Ulmus glabra Huds.)-was studied in the mixed stands (105-157 years) in the western Krkonose Mountains (Czech Republic) concerning climate change. These are communities of maple to fir beechwoods (association Aceri-Fagetum sylvaticae and Luzulo-Abietetum albae) on ranker soils at the altitude 590-700 m a.s.l. Production, structure, and biodiversity were evaluated in seven permanent research plots and the relationships of the radial growth (150 cores) to climatic parameters (precipitation, temperature, and extreme conditions) and air pollution (SO2, NOX, ozone exposure). The stand volume reached 557-814 m(3) ha(-1) with high production potential of spruce and ash. The radial growth of beech and spruce growing in relatively favorable habitat conditions (deeper soil profile and less skeletal soils) has increased by 16.6%-46.1% in the last 20 years. By contrast, for sycamore and ash growing in more extreme soil conditions, the radial growth decreased by 12.5%-14.6%. However, growth variability increased (12.7%-29.5%) for all tree species, as did the occurrence of negative pointer years (extremely low radial growth) in the last two decades. The most sensitive tree species to climate and air pollution were spruce and beech compared to the resilience of sycamore and ash. Spectral analysis recorded the largest cyclical fluctuations (especially the 12-year solar cycle) in spruce, while ash did not show any significant cycle processes. The limiting factors of growth were droughts with high temperatures in the vegetation period for spruce and late frosts for beech. According to the degree of extreme habitat conditions, individual tree species thus respond appropriately to advancing climate change, especially to an increase in the mean temperature (by 2.1 degrees C), unevenness in precipitation, and occurrence of extreme climate events in the last 60 years.

AB  - The promotion of biodiesel from palm oil for on-road transportation during the past decade has led to the expansion of oil palm plantations, including in Thailand. Hence, it is necessary to study the effects of land use for oil palm and the linkage between each impact for a holistic understanding. Besides, the consideration of various impact aspects in terms of a nexus is necessary for suggesting appropriate practices or zoning, because a single impact evaluation may not be comprehensive. Therefore, this study assessed the land use impacts from oil palm plantations in the five regions of Thailand. The land use impacts studied were greenhouse gas emissions, water scarcity, soil quality, and biodiversity. The assessment indicated the southern region to be the most suitable for further expansion of oil palm plantations, which is consistent with the government recommendation. However, if the expansion of oil palm in other regions is necessary, the central region is recommended because of available irrigation supply and better soil fertility compared to other regions. This study found that the land use impacts resulted from unsuitable management of oil palm plantations in the past. The increase of greenhouse gas emissions was mainly due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers for soil quality improvement and water pumping from irrigation water consumption. Meanwhile, the deficiency of water availability led to the degradation of biodiversity and ecosystems. To decrease the land use impacts in the long run, suitable practice is important for sustainable oil palm plantations. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim An increase in conifer mortality has been observed widely across the boreal forest biome. We investigate the causes of this mortality, in addition to the geospatial and temporal dynamics of mortality, in Siberian pine and fir stands.
   Location Central Siberia.
   Time period 1950-2018.
   Major taxa studied Pinus sibirica Du Tour and Abies sibirica Ledeb.
   Methods We used geospatial analysis of satellite-derived (MODIS, Landsat) data, topography (elevation, slope steepness and exposure) and climatic variables [precipitation, thermal degree days (TDD = n-ary sumation (t > 0 degrees C), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and root zone moisture content (RZM)], together with in situ data. Dendrochronology was applied for analysis of the radial growth increment (GI).
   Results Siberian pine and fir mortality has increased greatly in recent decades. The mortality of forest stands and trees was dependent on the TDD, RZM and SPEI. Mortality occurred mainly within the southern part of the species ranges and decreased northward, correlated with latitudinal gradients of TDD and SPEI. Mortality was observed mostly at elevations < 1,000 m and decreased with increasing elevation, whereas the area of forests and GI of trees increased with elevation. Forest mortality was preceded by the changes in tree GI. Since the onset of climate warming, GI increased until a breakpoint in the mid-1980s. Further temperature increase caused a reduction in GI owing to moisture stress and division of the tree population into "decliners" and "survivors". Mortality was caused by the combined impact of moisture stress and bark beetle attacks.
   Main conclusion Siberian pine and fir mortality was preceded by a reduction in the GI of trees caused by elevated air temperatures, acute droughts and subsequent insect attacks. Forest mortality was observed mostly at low elevations, whereas within the areas with sufficient moisture availability (at elevations c. < 1,000 m) the tree GI and forest area increased. With the projected increase in drought, Siberian pine and fir trees are predicted to retreat from their southern low-elevation ranges.

AB  - Natural forests are a basic component of the earth's ecology. It is essential for biodiversity, hydrological cycle regulation, and environmental protection. Natural forests are gradually degraded and reduced due to timber logging, conversion to cropland, production forests, commodity trees, and infrastructure development. Decreasing natural forests results in loss of valuable habitats, land degradation, soil erosion, and imbalance of water cycle on the regional scale. Thus, operational monitoring of natural forest cover change has been in the interest of scientists for a long time. Current forest mapping methods using remotely sensed data provide limited capability to separate natural forests and planted forests. Natural forest statistics are often generated using official forestry national reports that have different bias levels due to different methodologies applied in different countries in forest inventory. Over the last couple of decades, natural forests have been over-exploited for various reasons. This led to forest cover degradation and water regulation capability, which results in extreme floods and drought of a watershed in general. This situation demands an urgent need to develop a fast, reliable, and automated method for mapping natural forests. In this study, by applying a new method for mapping natural forests by Landsat time series, the authors succeeded in mapping changes of natural forests of Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam from 1989 to 2018. As a focused study area, three provinces: Ratanakiri of Cambodia, Attapeu of Laos, and Kon Tum of Vietnam were selected. The study reveals that after 30 years, 51.3% of natural forests in Ratanakiri, 27.8% of natural forests in Attapeu, and 50% of natural forests in Kon Tum were lost. Classification results were validated using high spatial resolution imagery of Google Earth. The overall accuracy of 99.3% for the year 2018 was achieved.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities are degrading forest health globally. Detection of changes in forest growth rates is possible with field measures of total net primary productivity (tNpp), however, assessing forest adaptive capacity was historically challenging due to a scarcity of tNpp data, knowledge of carbon allocation to above- and belowground biomass, and inability to calculate forest productive potential. This study used a global data set of 307 published research studies to identify tNpp thresholds and site-level factors constraining growth for forests in boreal, temperate, and tropical biomes. This data makes it possible to: (i) calculate the ratio of measured tNpp to a theoretical maximum tNpp from variables external to the site, its "ecosystem fit," (ii) identify environmental thresholds by scale and biogeography, and (iii) determine stand level conditions that limit growth. At the global scale, climatic variables explain most of the variance in tNpp whereas, at the biome scale different combinations of climatic/edaphic variables interact with phenological traits to explain productivity. For example, deciduous boreal forests were less resilient if precipitation increased, but deciduous tropical forests were less resilient if minimum annual temperature increased. At the biome scale, boreal forest mean tNpp (7.3 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) was significantly lower than tropical forests (19.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) but the mean tNpp of temperate forests tNpp (14.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) did not significantly differ from boreal or tropical forests, representing a first-order latitudinal forcing of productivity. Comparison of ranked clusters of tNpp (low, medium, high) indicated that the tropics had a larger proportion of highly productive forests (20%) than temperate (12%) or boreal forests (14%). Tropical forests are highly adapted to small-scale environmental heterogeneity but their unique evolutionary trajectories make them more sensitive to land-use change, habitat fragmentation, and climate disruption. There was minimal overlap among the high tNpp groups between boreal forests (12.0-18.2 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and temperate forests (17.6-37.7 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), and moderate overlap between temperate and tropical forests (26.8-45.9 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)), indicating increased adaptive capacity to environmental variability by climatic zone. All tropical forests had similar ecosystem fit, but Paleotropic forests growing on Inceptisol and Entisol soils were significantly more productive than Neotropical forests revealing similar adaptive capacity although there were less favorable growing conditions in the Neotropics. This study supports including site-level variations in edaphic and climatic factors to understand changes in primary productivity due to disturbance and proposes using Ecosystem fit to identify forest adaptive capacity in response to climate destabilization.

AB  - The elimination of flooding and lowering of the groundwater table after large-scale river regulation allow deep penetration of soils by plant roots, soil fauna, and microorganisms, thus creating favorable conditions for advanced pedogenesis. Although the changes of the morphology and properties of agriculturally used drained alluvial soils in Central Europe have been well characterized, studies in riparian forests remain insufficient. An analysis of 21 profiles of forest soils located on the Holocene river terrace (a floodplain before river regulation and embankment) in SW Poland confirmed a noticeable pedogenic transformation of soil morphology and properties resulting from river regulation. Gleyic properties were in most profiles replaced with stagnic properties, testifying to a transition from dominant groundwater supply to precipitation-water supply. The development of a diagnostic mollic and cambic horizons, correlated with the shift in soil classification from Fluvisols to Phaeozems, and in the majority, to Cambisols, demonstrated a substantial change in habitat conditions. The transformation of alluvial soils may result in an inevitable modification of forest management in the river valley, including quantitative alteration in species composition of primarily riparian forests.

AB  - Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) has been a key tree species and timber source in European forests the last centuries and is increasingly suffering from drought and bark beetle infestations due to climate warming. Current management options include replacing of Norway spruce monocultures with pure and mixed stands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) that is the naturally dominating tree species in Central Europe. Additionally, Douglas fir (Psudotsuga menziesii), a tree species with high water use efficiency and drought tolerance, is being increasingly cultivated to increase the resilience of European forests and meet the future demand of conifer timber in a warming climate. We studied the seepage water quantity and quality with a particular focus on the nitrate (NO3-) concentration and N leaching under pure and mixed stands of Douglas fir, Norway spruce, and European beech at seven sites in Germany. Additionally, we investigated seepage water concentrations of SO4-S, Ca, Mg, K, Al and hydrological variables (interception, canopy throughfall, transpiration). Looking at the seepage water quantity and quality, the best management option is the cultivation of pure beech stands. However, this is associated with the well-known risk of monocultures concerning ecosystem disturbance. Beech stands showed the highest seepage water quantities and the lowest seepage water concentrations of major cations and anions, including NO3-. Seepage water quantity was the smallest under pure Douglas fir compared to spruce and beech stands. The composition effects of stand tree species on seepage water quality and nutrient leaching were site-dependent. At N-rich sites, pure Douglas fir stands showed higher seepage water NO3- concentrations than spruce and beech stands, whereas the tree species effects were small at N-poor sites. With respect to seepage water quantity and quality, cultivation of mixed Douglas fir-beech stands is a promising option for producing conifer timber and at the same time avoiding increased disturbance risks of mono-species forests under a warmer climate. Our results support the recommendation of mixed Douglas fir-beech stands based on soil quality, ecosystem resilience, and forest economic studies.

AB  - Aims To identify environmental and anthropogenic drivers of alpha- and beta-diversity for native and alien plant species. Location Rio de la Plata grasslands, South America (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay; 27.3-39.1 degrees S, 50.1-66.5 degrees W). Methods We assembled a data set of 597 vegetation plots distributed across the Rio de la Plata grasslands. To assess the drivers of native and alien alpha-diversity (species richness), we performed a generalized least-squares regression using environmental and anthropogenic predictors. We evaluated differences in beta-diversity using Simpson's pairwise dissimilarity between pairs of plots and used multiple regression on distance matrixes to investigate environmental and anthropogenic drivers on compositional dissimilarity for both native and alien plant species. Results Native species richness was higher in sites with less demanding environmental conditions, such as lower precipitation seasonality and soils with higher cation exchange capacity. Numbers of alien species were positively related to soil pH, cropland density and road density and negatively to precipitation seasonality, mean temperatures and soil cation exchange capacity. The compositional dissimilarity was similar for native and alien species assemblages (mean +/- SD: 0.64 +/- 0.16 and 0.64 +/- 0.35 respectively). Areas having similar climates and being geographically close shared more taxonomically similar assemblages, for both native and alien assemblages, while soil had disparate effects. Compositional dissimilarity of alien plants decreased with increasing road density. Conclusions Our results highlight a grassland ecosystem where native species richness is still shaped only by environmental factors, but both sets of factors influence its composition. On the other hand, alien plants carry a strong signal of both environmental and human factors. As time progresses the number of alien species tend to increase, eroding the patterns of native biodiversity. To avoid this, efforts should be made to reduce road encroachment and the conversion of natural grasslands into croplands.

AB  - European forests are an important source for timber production, human welfare, income, protection and biodiversity. During the last two decades, Europe has experienced a number of droughts which have been exceptional within the last 500 years, both in terms of duration and intensity. These droughts seem to leave remarkable imprints on the mortality dynamics of European forests. However, systematic observations on tree decline, with emphasis on a single species, has been scarce so far so that our understanding of mortality dynamics and drought occurrence is still limited at a continental scale. Here, we make use of the ICP Forest crown defoliation dataset, permitting us to retrospectively monitor tree mortality for all major conifers, major broadleaves, as well as a pooled dataset of minor tree species in Europe. In total, we analysed more than three million observations gathered during the last 25 years and employed a high-resolution drought index which can assess soil moisture anomaly based on a hydrological water-balance and runoff model. We found overall and species-specific increasing trends in mortality rates, accompanied by decreasing soil moisture. A generalized linear mixed model identified a previous-year soil moisture anomaly as the most important driver of mortality patterns in conifers, but the response was not uniform across the numerous analysed plots. We conclude that mortality patterns in European forests are currently reaching a concerning upward trend which could be further accelerated by global change-type droughts in the near future.

AB  - Atlantic White Cedar (AWC) swamps are a globally threatened type of wetland ecosystem and are a new form of ghost forest in the mid-Atlantic region of the US. Hydrogeomorphic regimes foster peat formation, resulting in unique biodiversity and carbon sequestration services. Our sites include regimes that are exposed to sea-level rise and storm-driven seawater intrusion, yet other sites are protected by higher elevations. In this study, we evaluated climatic variables to discern differences in tree ring formation as an indicator of growth among nine stands including micro-tidal, oligohaline sites as well as other protected areas which served as a control. Standard dendrochronological techniques were used, and series were divided into two sub-chronologies, 1895 to 1971 (early) and 1972 to 2018 (recent). AWC growth in response to precipitation parameters, e.g., Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), were largely non-significant but were somewhat reversed among sub-chronologies. Early correlations were primarily negatively correlated with PDSI, while recent correlations were mostly positive, which suggests that even though inundation may reduce photosynthate availability for growth, precipitation has begun to increase growth by alleviating osmotic and toxic stresses associated with seawater. Analysis of climatic variables and tree growth at the reference site found that other anthropogenic stressors associated with ditching exert a greater influence. Hurricane impacts on tree growth exhibited no lasting negative effects; however, an AWC ghost forest report from New Jersey connected mortality to a hurricane. Hydrogeomorphic regimes may delay rather than eliminate risks associated with sea-level rise and storm-driven seawater.

AB  - Background As important forest tree species, biological stress and soil salinization are important factors that restrict the growth of Populus x euramericana. WRKYs are important transcription factors in plants that can regulate plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, PeWRKY31 was isolated from Populus x euramericana, and its bioinformation, salt resistance and insect resistance were analyzed. This study aims to provide guidance for producing salt-resistant and insect-resistant poplars. Results PeWRKY31 has a predicted open reading frame (ORF) of 1842 bp that encodes 613 amino acids. The predicted protein is the unstable, acidic, and hydrophilic protein with a molecular weight of 66.34 kDa, and it has numerous potential phosphorylation sites, chiefly on serines and threonines. PeWRKY31 is a zinc-finger C2H2 type-II WRKY TF that is closely related to WRKY TFs of Populus tomentosa, and localizes to the nucleus. A PeWRKY31 overexpression vector was constructed and transformed into Nicotiana tabacum L. Overexpression of PeWRKY31 improved the salt tolerance and insect resistance of the transgenic tobacco. Transcriptome sequencing and KEGG enrichment analysis showed the elevated expression of genes related to glutathione metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction, and MAPK signaling pathways, the functions of which were important in plant salt tolerance and insect resistance in the overexpressing tobacco line. Conclusions PeWRKY31 was isolated from Populus x euramericana. Overexpression of PeWRKY31 improved the resistance of transgenic plant to salt stress and pest stress. The study provides references for the generation of stress-resistant lines with potentially great economic benefit.

AB  - Forests contribute directly to ecosystem structure and functioning, maintaining biodiversity, acting as a climate regulator and reducing desertification. To better manage forests, it is essential to have high-resolution forest models and appropriate spatial-explicit variables able to explain tree cover at different scales, including the management scale. Most tree cover models rely only on broad-scale variables (>500 m), such as macroclimate, while only few studies include also local-scale variables (<500 m). This study aimed to identify the importance of local-scale factors relative to broad-scale factors and identify the environmental variables at different scales that explain tree cover in oak woodlands in Mediterranean drylands. Sixty sites previously identified as being covered with Holm oak or Cork oak were stratified by precipitation. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, used here as a surrogate of tree cover, was modelled using simultaneously broad-scale factors (macroclimate) and local-scale factors (microclimatic and edaphic conditions). The percentage of variance explained by local-and broad-scale factors and the effect size of each environmental variable on tree cover was determined for the study site. It was found that local-scale factors and their interaction with broad-scale factors explained more variance than broad-scale factors alone. The most important local-scale factors explaining tree cover were elevation, potential solar radiation, used as a surrogate of microclimatic conditions, and wetness evaluated terrain used as an indicator of water flow accumulation. The main broad-scale factors were related to temperature and precipitation. The effect of some local-scale variables in tree cover seems to increase in areas where water as a limiting factor is more important. This study demonstrates the critical importance of including local scale factors in multi-scale modelling of tree cover to obtain better predictions. These models will support well-suited forest management decisions, such as reforestation and afforestation plans to reverse evergreen oaks decline in Mediterranean drylands.

AB  - Mountain ecosystems are particularly threatened by ongoing climate change and the species composition of high elevation grasslands is already changing. An open research question is how these ecosystems will adapt to changes in their key environmental constraints. The responses of wooded pastures to experimental climate forcing were analysed in a transplantation experiment conducted downslope, along an elevational temperature and precipitation gradient on the lee side of Jura Mountains, Switzerland (up to +4.17 degrees C and -35% precipitation). To improve mechanistic understanding of biodiversity and biomass decreases in response to transplantation, changes in functional traits within foliage and roots of one ubiquitous (Taraxacum officinale) and one montane (Alchemilla monticola) perennial forb species were investigated. In consequence of transplantation, the two studied species raised their temperature optimum for CO2 assimilation and net photosynthesis yield from 20 to 30 degrees C. During cool periods, the highest rates of leaf gas exchanges were measured at the lower recipient sites. However, an opposite trend was observed during a spring drought and summer warm spell. Regarding the more integrative morpho-anatomical traits, Alchemilla primarily acclimated to warmer temperatures at the recipient sites with increased leaf and foliage rosette size. Missing xeromorphic and/or hydraulic adjustments in foliage and roots, its susceptibility to higher vapour pressure deficits and lower soil moisture availability was thus enhanced. Taraxacum showed adjustments to both warmer temperature and lower moisture availability, including reduced leaf size, lower hydraulic diameter of xylem vessels and theoretical specific hydraulic conductivity. The anticipated shift in the environmental conditions at high elevation, with reduced coldness limitation but increasingly constraining water economy, could thus become particularly demanding for montane species of wooded pastures. It may favour perennials with large phenotypic plasticity but leads to maladjustments and loss of the species which are more specifically adapted to montane conditions.

AB  - Understory plants have an important role in regulating various functions and processes in forest ecosystems. However, the overall consequences of understory plant losses on soil properties remain unclear. Here, we used a meta-analysis to determine overall trends in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and microorganism following understory removal experiments in forest ecosystems of China. Sites with removed understories exhibited significant increases in soil temperature and decreases in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, soil water content, pH, and microbial biomass. Fungi responded more quickly to plant removal than bacteria. Negative effects were increased with treatment duration and were stronger in broad-leaved forests than in coniferous forests. The responses of soil water, nutrient content, and microbial community composition to understory plant removal diminished as mean annual temperature and precipitation decreased. Our study showed that the effects of understory plant removal on soil properties varied among experimental durations, ecosystem types, and environmental factors (i.e., mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and latitude). These results indicate that understory plants help in sustaining soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and microbial activities in forest ecosystems. Our findings suggest that understory plants should be maintained to support the health of forest ecosystems.

AB  - Increasing drought and changing temperatures drive researchers to seek more efficient and effective means to aid management of coniferous forests across the western United States. Thinning allows for effective removal of biomass, but with few options to remove the residual slash from the treatment unit after saleable timber is taken away, pile burning has become a favored method of debris removal. Pile burning has greater efficiency and reduced removal cost as compared to air curtain burning or whole tree removal. In this review, we synthesize the current knowledge on the effects of slash pile burning on soil physical properties, soil nutrients, impacts to understory vegetation and tree regeneration, animal responses to pile burning, and the variety of remediation techniques for burn scar areas. Forest composition and age, climate, and fire intensity have the greatest impact on the outcomes of pile burning. Pre-fire ecosystem dynamics influence the changes to soil structure and nutrient profile, where native vegetation can either capitalize on changes such as altered nitrogen pathways, or be outcompeted by nonnative species. We hypothesize that vegetation adaptations to the natural fire interval may play a role in recovery from these high-intensity burn piles, and with further research, could assist managers in improved remediation efforts. We identify existing gaps in our knowledge of the ecosystem effects of slash pile burning, and to suggest some management-centered areas for further research.

AB  - Biological invasions have modified the terrestrial biota worldwide, reducing biodiversity, and causing economic loss. Copernicia prunifera (Carnauba), a palm tree native to the semi-arid region of Brazil (Caatinga ecosystem), has high economic and social importance, but has been impacted by the invasive climbing shrub Cryptostegia madagascariensis (Madagascar rubber vine). We evaluated physiological, biochemical, and nutritional responses in mature plants of both species in two locations: Catuana (where there is an intense water-deficit during the dry season) and Minguau (where there is high salinity and sodicity, and excess water throughout the year). Our results show that competitive interaction between the two species is mainly defined by their adaptability to abiotic soil constraints. C. prunifera is better adapted to severe water-deficit conditions, but its ecophysiological performance is not sufficient to withstand invasion by C. madagascariensis. The invader is more competitive in flooded, salt-affected soils, and is not severely impacted even with high sodium accumulation in its leaves. Our results also show that the negative impacts on C. prunifera intensify at the final stage of infestation, when the shading caused by C. madagascariensis restricts access to solar radiation and accelerates leaf senescence. However, the impact on C. prunifera precedes the permanent shading, as evidenced by the inhibition of net assimilation of CO2 under intermediate levels of infestation. These results reinforce the vulnerability of carnauba populations in the Caatinga ecosystem, which may be severely impacted without the development of technologies to mitigate the impact of invasion.

AB  - Forest damage by insect infestation directly affects the trees themselves, but also indirectly affects water quality via soil processes. The changes in water composition may undergo different pathways depending on site-specific characteristics and forest components, especially the proportion of coniferous and deciduous trees. Here, we test whether changes in forest components and the intensity of disturbance can predict the chemical properties of water outflow from affected lake catchments. Information about forest regeneration (a phase dominated by deciduous trees) and the proportions of damaged and healthy coniferous trees and treeless areas were obtained from satellite data. The four study catchments of Pra"silske, Laka, Ple"sne, and Certovo lakes are geographically close and located in the same mountain range (Sumava Mts., Czech Republic) at similar altitude, but they differ in extents of forest disturbances and recoveries. The water quality measured at the lake catchment outflows differed, and better reflected the development of forest components and health than did meteorological (temperature and precipitation) or hydrological (discharge) variables. Several of the outflow properties (concentrations of inorganic aluminium, protons, potassium, calcium, magnesium, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate, and total phosphorus), responded catchment-specifically and with different delays to forest disturbance. The most pronounced differences occurred in DOC concentrations, which started to increase in the most disturbed Ple"sne and Laka catchments 7 and 6 years, respectively, after the peak in tree dieback, but did not increase significantly in the Pra"silske catchment, which was disturbed several times during the last 3-4 decades. This study demonstrates an importance of extents of forest disturbances, the following changes in forest composition, and catchment-specific characteristics on water composition.

AB  - Understanding the recovery rate of forest carbon stocks and biodiversity after disturbance, including fire, is vital for developing effective climate-change-mitigation policies and actions. In this study, live and dead carbon stocks aboveground, belowground, and in the soil to a 30 cm depth, as well as tree and shrub species diversity, were measured in a tropical lowland dry forest, 23 years after a fire in 1998, for comparison with adjacent unburned reference forests. The results showed that 23 years since the fire was insufficient, in this case, to recover live forest carbon and plant species diversity, to the level of the reference forests. The total carbon stock, in the recovering 23-year-old forest, was 199 Mg C ha(-1) or about 90% of the unburned forest (220 Mg C ha(-1)), mainly due to the contribution of coarse woody debris and an increase in the 5-10 cm soil horizon's organic carbon, in the burned forest. The carbon held in the live biomass of the recovering forest (79 Mg C ha(-1)) was just over half the 146 Mg C ha(-1) of the reference forest. Based on a biomass mean annual increment of 6.24 +/- 1.59 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), about 46 +/- 17 years would be required for the aboveground live biomass to recover to equivalence with the reference forest. In total, 176 plant species were recorded in the 23-year post-fire forest, compared with 216 in the unburned reference forest. The pioneer species Macaranga gigantea dominated in the 23-year post-fire forest, which was yet to regain the similar stand structural and compositional elements as those found in the adjacent unburned reference forest.

AB  - Termites are globally dominant and functionally important soil organisms. While their role in ecosystems is being increasingly recognised and understood, methods that adequately sample termite communities across habitats can be challenging and have not advanced at the same pace as studies of termite ecology. Moreover, the appropriateness of sampling methods varies with habitat and biogeographic region due to differences in termite communities. Focusing largely on tropical systems where the majority of termites occur, we review currently available termite sampling methods and provide recommendations for sampling across different biomes and biogeographic regions. Active searching transects are most effective in rainforest habitats, whereas reduced transects, baiting and mound surveys are more appropriate in grassy systems and seasonally dry forests. Baiting is recommended for deserts. Recent advances in termite sampling, such as the use of remote sensing and DNA metabarcoding, and outstanding challenges, such as sampling episodic grass-feeding termites, are also discussed. Improved use of standardised termite sampling methods, as we recommend, should lead to increased knowledge of the patterns and drivers of termite diversity, which will, in turn, facilitate the quantification of the influence termites have on ecosystems and lead to new insights into the functioning of tropical systems.

AB  - Natural grasslands are among the most threatened biomes on Earth. They are under pressure from land cover change including afforestation, farming intensification, invasive species, altered fire regimes, and soil amendments, all of which impact native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. In Aotearoa New Zealand, tussock-dominated native grasslands expanded due to increased fire activity during waves of human settlement. These areas have subsequently been maintained as modified grasslands by agricultural pastoral land management practices and effects of introduced feral mammals. Despite many decades of research on biodiversity in tussock grasslands, we need greater fundamental understanding of many processes causing change in their biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in order to predict how future global change will impact this important and increasingly threatened biome. In this perspective forum article, we present five key research questions that, if answered, would greatly enhance our understanding of connections between tussock grassland biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and associated ecosystem services: (1) What are the relative impacts of domesticated and non-domesticated mammals on indigenous biodiversity in grasslands? (2) Where will invasive plants undergo range expansion? (3) Will future fires tip tussock grasslands into alternative vegetation states? (4) What are the implications of woody thickening by native or non-native species? (5) What are the impacts of global change, and vegetation change in particular, on soil processes and ecosystem functioning? We provide recommendations for research to address and integrate across these questions using both existing and new data. This work would build on our current knowledge and lead to a framework to better understand the ecological impacts of ongoing global change in tussock grasslands.

AB  - The Western United States is dominated by natural lands that play a critical role for carbon balance, water quality, and timber reserves. This region is also particularly vulnerable to forest mortality from drought, insect attack, and wildfires, thus requiring constant monitoring to assess ecosystem health. Carbon monitoring techniques are challenged by the complex mountainous terrain, thus there is an opportunity for data assimilation systems that combine land surface models and satellite-derived observations to provide improved carbon monitoring. Here, we use the Data Assimilation Research Testbed to adjust the Community Land Model (CLM5.0) with remotely sensed observations of leaf area and above-ground biomass. The adjusted simulation significantly reduced the above-ground biomass and leaf area, leading to a reduction in both photosynthesis and respiration fluxes. The reduction in the carbon fluxes mostly offset, thus both the adjusted and free simulation projected a weak carbon sink to the land. This result differed from a separate observation-constrained model (FLUXCOM) that projected strong carbon uptake to the land. Simulation diagnostics suggested water limitation had an important influence upon the magnitude and spatial pattern of carbon uptake through photosynthesis. We recommend that additional observations important for water cycling (e.g., snow water equivalent, land surface temperature) be included to improve the veracity of the spatial pattern in carbon uptake. Furthermore, the assimilation system should be enhanced to maximize the number of the simulated state variables that are adjusted, especially those related to the recommended observed quantities including water cycling and soil carbon.

AB  - Background The ability of overstory tree species to regenerate successfully is important for the preservation of tree species diversity and its associated flora and fauna. This study investigated forest regeneration dynamics in the Cat Ba National Park, a biodiversity hotspot in Vietnam. Data was collected from 90 sample plots (500 m(2)) and 450 sub-sample plots (25 m(2)) in regional limestone forests. We evaluated the regeneration status of tree species by developing five ratios relating overstory and regeneration richness and diversity. By examining the effect of environmental factors on these ratios, we aimed to identify the main drivers for maintaining tree species diversity or for potential diversity gaps between the regeneration and the overstory layer. Our results can help to increase the understanding of regeneration patterns in tropical forests of Southeast Asia and to develop successful conservation strategies. Results We found 97 tree species in the regeneration layer compared to 136 species in the overstory layer. The average regeneration density was 3764 +/- 1601 per ha. Around 70% of the overstory tree species generated offspring. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, only 36% of threatened tree species were found in the regeneration layer. A principal component analysis provided evidence that the regeneration of tree species was slightly negatively correlated to terrain factors (percentage of rock surface, slope) and soil properties (cation exchange capacity, pH, humus content, soil moisture, soil depth). Contrary to our expectations, traces of human impact and the prevailing light conditions (total site factor, gap fraction, openness, indirect site factor, direct site factor) had no influence on regeneration density and composition, probably due to the small gradient in light availability. Conclusion We conclude that the tree species richness in Cat Ba National Park appears to be declining at present. We suggest similar investigations in other biodiversity hotspots to learn whether the observed trend is a global phenomenon. In any case, a conservation strategy for the threatened tree species in the Cat Ba National Park needs to be developed if tree species diversity is to be maintained.

AB  - Litter decomposition is a key ecosystem function in forests and varies in response to a range of climatic, edaphic, and local stand characteristics. Disentangling the relative contribution of these factors is challenging, especially along large environmental gradients. In particular, knowledge of the effect of management options, such as tree planting density and species composition, on litter decomposition would be highly valuable in forestry. In this study, we made use of 15 tree diversity experiments spread over eight countries and three continents within the global TreeDivNet network. We evaluated the effects of overstory composition (tree identity, species/mixture composition and species richness), plan-tation conditions (density and age), and climate (temperature and precipitation) on mass loss (after 3 months and 1 year) of two standardized litters: high-quality green tea and low-quality rooibos tea. Across continents, we found that early-stage decomposition of the low-quality rooibos tea was influenced locally by overstory tree identity. Mass loss of rooibos litter was higher under young gymnosperm overstories compared to angiosperm overstories, but this trend reversed with age of the experiment. Tree species richness did not influence decomposition and explained almost no variation in our multi-continent dataset. Hence, in the young plantations of our study, overstory composition effects on decomposition were mainly driven by tree species identity on decomposer communities and forest microclimates. After 12 months of incubation, mass loss of the high-quality green tea litter was mainly influenced by temperature whereas the low-quality rooibos tea litter decomposition showed stronger relationships with overstory composition and stand age. Our findings highlight that decomposition dynamics are not only affected by climate but also by man-agement options, via litter quality of the identity of planted trees but also by overstory composition and structure.

AB  - 1. Enhancing biodiversity-based ecosystem services can generate win-win opportunities for conservation and agricultural production. Pollination and pest control are two essential agricultural services provided by mobile organisms, many depending on native vegetation networks beyond the farm scale. Many studies have evaluated the effects of landscape changes on such services at small scales. However, several landscape management policies (e.g. selection of conservation sites) and associated funding allocation occur at much larger spatial scales (e.g. state or regional level). Therefore, it is essential to understand whether the links between landscape, ecosystem services and crop yields are robust across broad and heterogeneous regional conditions.
   2. Here, we used data from 610 Brazilian municipalities within the Atlantic Forest region (similar to 50 Mha) and show that forest is a crucial factor affecting coffee yields, regardless of regional variations in soil, climate and management practices. We found forest cover surrounding coffee fields was better at predicting coffee yields than forest cover at the municipality level. Moreover, the positive effect of forest cover on coffee yields was stronger for Coffea canephora, the species with higher pollinator dependence, than for Coffea arabica. Overall, coffee yields were highest when they were near to forest fragments, mostly in landscapes with intermediate to high forest cover (>20%), above the biodiversity extinction threshold.
   3. Coffee cover was the most relevant management practice associated with coffee yield prediction. An increase in crop area was associated with a higher yield, but mostly in high forest covers municipalities. Other localized management practices like irrigation, pesticide use, organic manure and honeybee density had little importance in predicting coffee yields than landscape structure parameters. Neither the climatic or topographic variables were as relevant as forest cover at predicting coffee yields.
   4. Synthesis and application. Our work provides evidence that landscape relationships with ecosystem service provision are consistent across regions with different agricultural practices and environmental conditions. These results provide a way in which landscape management can articulate small landscape management with regional conservation goals. Policies directed towards increasing landscape interspersion of coffee fields with forest remnants favour spillover process, and can thus benefit the provision of biodiversity-based ecosystem services, increasing agricultural productivity. Such interventions can generate win-win situations favouring biodiversity conservation and increased crop yields across large regions.

AB  - Aims Conversion of natural mixed forests into monoculture plantations results in a loss of biodiversity, and consequently leads to serious ecological problems (e.g. soil acidification and soil fertility declines) by controlling the quantity and quality of litter entering the soil. Plant diversity in the understorey is the most important component of aboveground biodiversity in plantations and plays a critical role in the sustainable development of plantations. Thinning has been proven effective in promoting the regeneration of understorey plants, and most studies have targeted the effects of thinning on a single biodiversity index (e.g. species richness) of the understorey in plantations. The effects of thinning on functional and phylogenetic diversity are less addressed, however, which could limit the full understanding of biodiversity maintenance and potential processes of community assembly integrally in plantations after thinning.Location Northeast China.Methods We chose young and middle-aged larch (Larix kaempferi) plantations based on the time after thinning (short term, 1-3 years; medium term, 4-9 years; and long term, 10 years or longer), quantified the functional and phylogenetic diversity and the structure of regenerated woody plants in the understorey, and related the functional and phylogenetic diversity to environmental factors (canopy openness and soil nutrients).Results Functional richness and evenness decreased over time after thinning in two types of plantations, and in the medium term the functional divergence of young plantations was significantly lower. At short term after thinning, the phylogenetic diversity was higher in two types of plantations. Functional richness was significantly related to canopy openness in young plantations, while functional divergence was closely related to soil phosphorus content in middle-aged plantations. Functional and phylogenetic structure of the regenerated woody community changed from dispersion to clustering and had a significant relationship with environmental conditions (e.g. light availability in both young and middle-aged plantations), highlighting that environmental filtering gradually became the main driving force of community assembly in the regenerated community of the understorey.Conclusion The functional and phylogenetic diversity of regenerated woody plants changed over time after thinning under the influence of light availability, and environmental filtering played a crucial role in the assembly of the understorey community. Our study expands the research of biodiversity maintenance by considering the effects of thinning over time, and provides new insights into the management and sustainable development of plantations.

AB  - Carnivores across much of the world are declining, leading to loss of biodiversity as well as the ecosystem services carnivores provide. In 2020, the Alexander Archipelago (AA) wolf was petitioned for protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) for the third time in 30 years. Concerns included habitat alteration from industrial timber harvest and subsequent declines in prey (deer), human-caused mortality, climate change, and genetic inbreeding. However, the underlying biogeography and ecology of these wolves continues to suggest resiliency across the subspecies' range, even though local populations may go extinct. If local wolf populations go extinct, it will result in loss of their ecosystem services (e.g., interactions of wolves with their prey, which prevents over-browsing and protects carbon sequestration in soils and trees), which will likely have major consequences for the local social-ecological system. Here, we updated a model we constructed for the last ESA listing process (2015) to examine the dynamics of wolf and deer populations on Prince of Wales Island (the primary geographic focus of all three petitions) in response to future environmental and management scenarios developed with stakeholders. Further, we considered how changes in deer abundance impact predation services (prevention of over-browsing by deer). We found that wolf populations generally persisted over 30 years, but dropped below an effective population size of 50 wolves in 10-98% of years simulated. Low wolf abundance resulted in higher deer abundance, which increased hunting opportunity, but also browsing damages (e.g., 19% of areas would be over-browsed if wolf harvest caps are removed, and >30% of areas would be over-browsed if wolves go extinct). Human harvest of wildlife was a key regulator of abundance and ecosystem services within the coastal rainforest social-ecological system; wolf abundance was most affected by wolf harvest regulations; and deer harvest restrictions increased wolf and deer abundances, but also greatly increased browsing impacts (>70% of areas heavily browsed if hunting ceased). Our findings support an integrated approach to management of this social-ecological system, such that social and ecological sciences are both used to monitor important components of the system (e.g., measuring public sentiment and likelihood of poaching, alongside wolf and deer numbers). Integration and adaptive approaches are needed to ensure that the many ecosystem services humans depend on are valued, conserved, and restored, including the cryptic predation services wolves have historically provided to the timber industry via reduced browsing pressure by deer.

AB  - Climate is a dominant factor affecting the potential geographical distribution of species. Understanding the impact of climate change on the potential geographic distribution of species, which is of great significance to the exploitation, utilization, and protection of resources, as well as ecologically sustainable development. Betula platyphylla Suk. is one of the most widely distributed temperate deciduous tree species in East Asia and has important economic and ecological value. Based on 231 species distribution data points of Betula platyphylla Suk. in China and 37 bioclimatic, soil, and topography variables (with correlation coefficients < 0.75), the potential geographical distribution pattern of Betula platyphylla Suk. under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate change scenarios at present and in the 2050s and 2070s was predicted using the MaxEnt model. We analyzed the main environmental variables affecting the distribution and change of suitable areas and compared the scope and change of suitable areas under different climate scenarios. This study found: (1) At present, the main suitable area for Betula platyphylla Suk. extends from northeastern to southwestern China, with the periphery area showing fragmented distribution. (2) Annual precipitation, precipitation of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, annual mean temperature, and precipitation of the driest month are the dominant environmental variables that affect the potential geographical distribution of Betula platyphylla Suk. (3) The suitable area for Betula platyphylla Suk. is expected to expand under global warming scenarios. In recent years, due to the impact of diseases and insect infestation, and environmental damage, the natural Betula platyphylla Suk. forest in China has gradually narrowed. This study accurately predicted the potential geographical distribution of Betula platyphylla Suk. under current and future climate change scenarios, which can provide the scientific basis for the cultivation, management, and sustainable utilization of Betula platyphylla Suk. resources.

AB  - Elucidating how environmental factors drive plant species distributions and how they affect latitudinal diversity gradients, remain essential questions in ecology and biogeography. In this study we aimed: 1) to investigate the relationships between all three diversity attributes, i.e., taxonomic diversity (TD), functional diversity (FD), and phylogenetic diversity (PD); 2) to quantify the latitudinal variation in these diversity attributes in western Amazonian terra firme forests; and 3) to understand how climatic and edaphic drivers contribute to explaining diversity patterns. We inventoried ca. 15,000 individuals from ca. 1,250 species, and obtained functional trait records for ca. 5,000 woody plant individuals in 50 plots of 0.1 ha located in five terra firme forest sites spread over a latitudinal gradient of 1200 km covering ca. 10 degrees C in latitude in western Amazonia. We calculated all three diversity attributes using Hill numbers: q = 0 (richness), q = 1 (richness weighted by relative abundance), and q = 2 (richness weighted by dominance). Generalized linear mixed models were constructed for each diversity attribute to test the effects of different uncorrelated environmental predictors comprising the temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, soil pH and soil bulk density, as well as accounting for the effect of spatial autocorrelation, i.e., plots aggregated within sites. We confirmed that TD (q = 0, q = 1, and q = 2), FD (q = 0, q = 1, and q = 2), and PD (q = 0) increased monotonically towards the Equator following the latitudinal diversity gradient. The importance of rare species could explain the lack of a pattern for PD (q = 1 and q = 2). Temperature seasonality, which was highly correlated with latitude, and annual precipitation were the main environmental drivers of variations in TD, FD, and PD. All three diversity attributes increased with lower temperature seasonality, higher annual precipitation, and lower soil pH. We confirmed the existence of latitudinal diversity gradients for TD, FD, and PD in hyperdiverse Amazonian terra firme forests. Our results agree well with the predictions of the environmental filtering principle and the favourability hypothesis, even acting in a 10 degrees C latitudinal range within tropical climates.

AB  - Forest-savanna boundaries are ecotones that support complex ecosystem functions and are sensitive to biotic/abiotic perturbations. What drives their distribution today and how it may shift in the future are open questions. Feedbacks among climate, fire, herbivory, and land use are known drivers. Here, we show that alternating seasonal drought and waterlogging stress favors the dominance of savanna-like ecosystems over forests. We track the seasonal water-table depth as an indicator of water stress when too deep and oxygen stress when too shallow and map forest/savanna occurrence within this double-stress space in the neotropics. We find that under a given annual precipitation, savannas are favored in landscape positions experiencing double stress, which is more common as the dry season strengthens (climate driver) but only found in waterlogged lowlands (terrain driver). We further show that hydrological changes at the end of the century may expose some flooded forests to savanna expansion, affecting biodiversity and soil carbon storage. Our results highlight the importance of land hydrology in understanding/predicting forest-savanna transitions in a changing world.

AB  - Habitat disturbance and particularly land-use change from natural habitats to forest plantations, croplands, and urban expansion have caused a rapid biodiversity loss in southern South America's temperate rainforests. In those forests, bryophytes constitute a crucial component, with important ecosystem roles. We evaluated bryophyte diversity and species turnover between native temperate forests and sites with different degrees of disturbance to gain insight into how habitat disturbance affects the bryophyte community. We used four different habitat disturbance scenarios at a temperate rainforest, comprising primary native forests, secondary forests, clear-cut areas, and abandoned Eucalyptus forest plantations. We sampled bryophytes for three years (2016 to 2018) on four substrates (rock, soil, live wood, and deadwood). We found that species richness decreases, and turnover increases as disturbance increases. Liverworts were more sensitive to habitat disturbance than mosses, reaching their highest diversity in primary forests. Substrate availability was also a key factor for the bryophyte community, as species were non-randomly distributed among them. In conclusion, habitat disturbance affects the temperate forest bryophyte community, altering its composition along with disturbance conditions. Considering the crucial roles that bryophytes play within the ecosystem, these changes can also affect bird and mammal species that use them as nesting material.

AB  - 1. Carbon starvation posits that defoliation- and drought-induced mortality results from drawing down stored non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), but evidence is mixed, and few studies evaluate mortality directly. We tested the relationships among defoliation severity, NSC drawdown and tree mortality by measuring NSCs in mature oak trees defoliated by an invasive insect, Lymantria dispar, across a natural gradient of defoliation severity.
   2. We collected stem and root samples from mature oaks (Quercus rubra and Q. alba) in interior forests (n = 34) and forest edges (n = 47) in central Massachusetts, USA. Total NSC (TNC; sugar + starch) stores were analysed with respect to tree size, species and defoliation severity, which ranged between 5% and 100%.
   3. TNC stores declined significantly with increasingly severe defoliation. Forest edge trees had higher TNC stores that were less sensitive to defoliation than interior forest trees, although this may be a result of differing defoliation history. Furthermore, we observed a mortality threshold of 1.5% dry weight TNC.
   4. Our study draws a direct link between insect defoliation and TNC reserves and defines a TNC threshold below which mortality is highly likely. These findings advance understanding and improve model parametrization of tree response to insect outbreaks, an increasing threat with globalization and climate change.

AB  - The provision of freshwater is essential for sustaining human life. Understanding the water provision modelling associated with the Land Use/Cover (LUC) change and climatic factors is vital for landscape water resource management. The Winike watershed is the largest tributary in the upper Omo Gibe basin of Ethiopia. This research aims to analyze the spatial and temporal change in the water yield to investigate the water yield contribution from the watershed based on the variation in input parameters. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs Tool (InVEST) water yield model was used to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of the water yield in different years (1988, 1998, 2008 and 2018). The data required for this model include LUC data from satellite images, reference evapotranspiration, root depth, plant available water, precipitation, season factor (Z), and a biophysical table. The analysis of LUC change shows a rapid conversion of grazing land, shrubland, and forest land into cultivated land. There has been a significant variation in water provision, which increased from 1.83 x 10(9) m(3) in 1988 to 3.35 x 10(9) m(3) in 2018. Sub-watersheds 31, 32, and 39 in the eastern part of the watershed contributed more water due to higher precipitation and lower reference evapotranspiration. The major increase in the contribution of water yield was in built-up land by 207.4%, followed by bare land, 148.54%, and forest land by 63%. Precipitation had a greater impact on water yield estimation compared with the other input parameters. Hence, this research helps decision-makers to make informed decisions regarding new policies for LUC change improvement to maintain the water resources in the Winike watershed.

AB  - Spatiotemporal heterogeneity in soil CO2 efflux (F-S) underlies one of our greatest gaps in understanding global carbon (C) cycles. Though scientists recognize this heterogeneity, F-S sampling schemes often average across spatial heterogeneity or fail to capture fine temporal heterogeneity, and many ecosystem models assume flat terrain. Here, we test the idea that simple, remotely sensible terrain variables improve regression models of spatiotemporal variation in F-S. We used automatic chambers that, for the first time, capture F-S in complex temperate forest terrain at fine temporal resolution with 177,477 hourly F-S measurements at 8 locations from ridgetop to valley along planar and swale hillslopes, across three years ranging from dry to record wet precipitation. In two of these years, we measured F-S weekly at 50 additional locations distributed across the 8-ha catchment. Growing season Fs estimates were 1.25 times greater when sampling hourly versus weekly. At ridgetops, growing season F-S increased by an average of 463 gC m(-2) 180 day(-1) (75.9%) from dry to wet years, while valleys decreased by 208 gC m(-2) 180 day(-1) (- 20.1%). This bidirectional response to interannual moisture was identified in distinct Random Forest models of Fs for convergent (water accumulating) or non-convergent (water shedding) hillslope positions. We hypothesize that different F-S constraints drive these opposing responses-water availably to biota limits F-S from ridgetops while slow oxygen diffusion limits F-S from wet valleys. Accounting for hillslope position and shape reduces variance of F-S estimates in complex terrain, which could improve F-S sampling, C budgets, and modeling.

AB  - Plants often show remarkable elevational distribution patterns in arid-montane ecosystems. However, it is not clear if soil microbes follow elevational diversity patterns, even though they represent the majority of biodiversity and drive varieties of ecological processes. Here, we conducted a survey of fungal and bacterial communities across an elevational gradient from 2350 to 3850 m in a typical mountainous grassland of arid northwestern China. Our results revealed co-ordinated alpha and beta diversity patterns for soil microbes and plants along the elevational gradient, and the richness and Shannon diversity of bacteria, fungi, and plants exhibited a unimodal elevational pattern. The unimodal diversity pattern for soil microbes was further confirmed by the shifts in the relative abundance of dominant bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Nitrospirae) and fungal phyla (Zygomycota) along the elevational gradient. Soil variables (soil pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and nitrate nitrogen) explained the largest proportion of the variability in both bacterial and fungal communities, followed by plant (richness and Shannon diversity) and climatic (mean annual temperature and precipitation) variables. These environmental factors together explained a larger proportion of variability in bacterial communities (54.88%) than in fungal communities (24.15%). Our results strongly supported the existence of co-ordinated elevational diversity patterns for soil microbes and plants in arid-montane ecosystems, and highlighted that the importance of soil pH in microbial elevational patterns was also apparently in alkaline soils. Highlights Soil bacteria and fungi follow elevational diversity patterns of plants. Species richness and Shannon diversity index exhibited unimodal elevational patterns. Soil, plant, and climatic factors are co-responsible for microbial diversity. These factors explained more variation in bacteria than that in fungi. Microbial diversity is more vulnerable to precipitation than temperature.

AB  - The hillslope is an essential natural spatial gradient that influences hydrological processes by affecting water distribution, surface flow, soil erosion, and groundwater recharge. To date, few studies have addressed only the hydrological processes of tropical forest hillslopes. To reveal the effect of hillslope on soil hydrological functioning-including water distribution and exchange, infiltration capacity, and flow behaviour-we conducted 36 field infiltration and nine dye-tracer investigations of different hillslope locations in the natural rainforest of Xishuangbanna, southwest China. The soil physical properties-including soil noncapillary and total porosity, saturated water capacity, and field water capacity-decreased with decreasing elevation from hilltop to middle slope and the valley bottom. The water infiltration capacity-including the initial infiltration rate, saturated soil hydraulic conductivity, and average infiltration rate-decreased from the hilltop to the valley bottom. Preferential flow dominated soil water movement more in the upper locations than in the valley bottom. The infiltration capacity parameters and preferential flow were significantly correlated with soil water content, noncapillary and total porosity, root biomass, and termite holes. These results indicated that along with the soil physical properties, root systems, animal activity, cracks, and stones affected the soil infiltration capacity and preferential flow. Differences in the hydraulic processes of each hillslope position contributed to the redistribution, transportation, and storage of surface and belowground water, resulting in differing availabilities of soil water resources and utilisation by plants. The findings of this study can help understand eco-hydrological processes in the context of water resources management in tropical mountain ecosystems.

AB  - Tropical montane ecosystems are the centers of biodiversity, and Janzen proposed that mountain climate variability plays a key role in sustaining this biodiversity. We test this hypothesis for soil bacteria and fungi along a 265-1,400 m elevational gradient on Hainan Island of tropical China, representing diverse vegetation types from deciduous monsoon forest to cloud forest. We found that bacterial and fungal diversity declined as elevation increased, and the dissimilarity of both groups increased with increasing separation in elevation, although changes in bacteria were larger than in fungi. Seasonal alterations and the range of soil moisture in the growing season were found to be the dominant drivers of fungal richness and Shannon diversity, whereas soil pH was the major driver of bacterial diversity. Dissimilarities of bacterial and fungal communities were best predicted by climate, particularly seasonal changes in soil temperature, with weaker influences of soil physicochemistry and vegetation. The dominant effect of seasonality in soil temperature was further detected in cloud forests, which harbored a higher proportion of unique bacterial species and dissimilarity of bacterial and fungal communities. Our findings suggest that local-climate variability plays a crucial role in structuring the distribution of soil microbial communities along a tropical montane gradient, which generally supports Janzen's hypothesis. Such a sensitivity to climatic variability suggests that soil microbial communities along tropical montane gradients may shift in response to future climate scenarios.

AB  - Larch forests are important for species diversity, as well as soil and water conservation in mountain regions. In this study, we determined large-scale patterns of species richness in larch forests and iden-tified the factors that drive these patterns. We found that larch forest species richness was high in southern China and low in northern China, and that patterns of species richness along an elevational gradient depend on larch forest type. In addition, we found that patterns of species richness in larch forests are best explained by contemporary climatic factors. Specifically, mean annual temperature and annual potential evapotranspiration were the most important factors for species richness of tree and shrub layers, while mean temperature of the coldest quarter and anomaly of annual precipitation from the Last Glacial Maximum to the present were the most important for that of herb layer and the whole community. Community structural factors, especially stand density, are also associated with the species richness of larch forests. Our findings that species richness in China's larch forests is mainly affected by energy availability and cold conditions support the ambient energy hypothesis and the freezing tolerance hypothesis.Copyright (c) 2022 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Elevation has been a cornerstone of biodiversity research, and changes in the environmental factors behind it influence biodiversity and community patterns. Exploring the potential reasons behind liverwort community patterns has been a matter of multiplied interest for ecologists. In the present study, we recorded the liverwort taxa of Sygera Mountain growing on decaying wood, trees, soil, and rocks along an elevational gradient from 3100 m to 4500 m using complex field surveys in 2017 and 2019; we investigated the effects of elevation and various climatic factors on the liverworts' diversity and community composition. Furthermore, we used mixed effect modeling, NMDS, ANOSIM, and CCA to help us critically assess liverwort diversity with respect to environmental variables. The results of the study showed a bimodal variation in the richness of liverwort communities according to elevation, with peaks occurring at 3500 m and 4100 m, respectively. The variation in elevation was significant, with communities at 4300 m being associated with high mean diurnal range environments and those at 3100 m and 3300 m favoring areas of higher solar radiation and the precipitation of the wettest month. Among the climatic factors, the variation in the mean diurnal range was found to be the determinant of liverwort communities. The results suggest that the mean diurnal range plays a crucial role in the distribution and community structure formation of mountain liverwort. This study deepens our understanding of liverwort ecology and emphasizes the importance of climatic variables in determining liverwort community composition.

AB  - Artisanal gold mining in Amazon forests and rivers has been reported in all Amazonian countries. Amazon mining has a wide range of negative effects and severe environmental and social consequences. Given that the activity in the region is mostly illegal, there are few studies published in the scientific literature on recovery of areas degraded by gold mining. This study conducts an experimental reforestation project aimed to evaluate soil degradation and explore the seedling survivorship and early growth of 51 tropical tree species in gold mined areas at 5 study sites distributed across the Madre de Dios region, in the Peruvian Amazon. The study evaluates the effect of biochar amendments on the survivorship and growth of 51 tropical species. The study also analyzes the influence of species wood density on seedling performance one year after planting. In order to inform further restoration plantation strategies, species were chosen with the end goals of timber production, biodiversity enhancement, and soil restoration. Site degradation, soil properties and mercury levels were analyzed in degraded areas and paired reference forest patches. Soils after gold mining are found to be highly degraded, with soil C being nearly absent, cation content greatly decreased, and loss of fine sediment. Soil mercury levels were found below national and international environmental quality standards. A positive correlation and a statistically significant relationship were found between survivorship and wood density. This reveals that the higher the wood density of the species, the higher the survival percentage. Growth and overall performance of mid, and especially low wood density species were significantly increased by biochar additions, while no effect was recorded on high wood density species growth. The study provides guidance on the post-ASGM restoration potential for 51 common and useful tree species and gives practitioners recommendations for combinations of species and fertilization treatments to optimize restoration designs.

AB  - The recovery of soil conditions is crucial for successful ecosystem restoration and, hence, for achieving the goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Here, we assess how soils resist forest conversion and agricultural land use, and how soils recover during subsequent tropical forest succession on abandoned agricultural fields. Our overarching question is how soil resistance and recovery depend on local conditions such as climate, soil type and land-use history. For 300 plots in 21 sites across the Neotropics, we used a chronosequence approach in which we sampled soils from two depths in old-growth forests, agricultural fields (i.e. crop fields and pastures), and secondary forests that differ in age (1-95 years) since abandonment. We measured six soil properties using a standardized sampling design and laboratory analyses. Soil resistance strongly depended on local conditions. Croplands and sites on high-activity clay (i.e. high fertility) show strong increases in bulk density and decreases in pH, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) during deforestation and subsequent agricultural use. Resistance is lower in such sites probably because of a sharp decline in fine root biomass in croplands in the upper soil layers, and a decline in litter input from formerly productive old-growth forest (on high-activity clays). Soil recovery also strongly depended on local conditions. During forest succession, high-activity clays and croplands decreased most strongly in bulk density and increased in C and N, possibly because of strongly compacted soils with low C and N after cropland abandonment, and because of rapid vegetation recovery in high-activity clays leading to greater fine root growth and litter input. Furthermore, sites at low precipitation decreased in pH, whereas sites at high precipitation increased in N and decreased in C : N ratio. Extractable phosphorus (P) did not recover during succession, suggesting increased P limitation as forests age. These results indicate that no single solution exists for effective soil restoration and that local site conditions should determine the restoration strategies.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding forest landscape restoration: reinforcing scientific foundations for the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration'.

AB  - CONTEXT: Agriculture provides food, fibre and other resources for people throughout the world, but clearing of native vegetation for agriculture has led to profound losses of biodiversity and changes to ecosystem function. There is growing recognition of the need to retain and restore (semi)natural vegetation in farmland for biodiversity conservation. However, managing such vegetation is complicated by trade-offs between different objectives, and knowledge to guide management is dispersed across multiple fields. OBJECTIVE: We integrate knowledge on the benefits and disbenefits of (semi)natural vegetation on farms for achieving six objectives, including biodiversity, farm production, carbon stocks, soil health, local water cycle, and amenity/human wellbeing. METHODS: Drawing on scientific literature from temperate southern Australia as a case study region, we develop a conceptual model of the relationships between these objectives and seven common types of native and restored vegetation on farms. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: From 224 peer-reviewed empirical studies, we identified 19 'causal pathways' by which (semi)natural vegetation provides benefits or disbenefits for the identified objectives. More pathways result in benefits than disbenefits, and generally there is greater support for the benefits provided by native than restored vegetation. Nonetheless, farm-level restoration (revegetation) contributes towards reversing the negative consequences of vegetation loss but this process takes time. Various 'moderating factors' serve to alter the outcome of most pathways. For example, restoration age affects the benefits that revegetation provides biodiversity, carbon stores, soil health and water cycling. Many moderating factors are related to management practices (e.g. stock grazing, use of fertilisers), highlighting opportunities to enhance the benefits of (semi) natural vegetation in farmland. Relatively little is known about the value of (semi)natural vegetation for amenity/human wellbeing, or the outcomes resulting from natural regeneration. SIGNIFICANCE: The conceptual model and causal pathways identified here contribute towards a more comprehensive understanding of the diverse benefits of (semi)natural vegetation on farms, which is essential effective management and the sustainability of agricultural landscapes worldwide.

AB  - Understanding temporal dynamics of plant biodiversity is crucial for conservation strategies at regional and local levels. The mostly applied hitherto methods are based on field observations of the plant communities and the related taxa. Satellite earth observation time series offer continuous and wider coverage for the assessment of plant diversity, especially in remote areas. Theoretical basis and large-scale solutions for assessing beta-diversity have been recently presented. Yet landscape-scale and context-based analysis are missing. We assessed temporal beta-diversity using Raas Q diversity derived from Landsat-based vegetation indices by considering the effect of ERA-5 monthly aggregates environmental factors (temperature and precipitation) extracted using Google Earth Engine (GEE), land use classes, and two common vegetation indices. We derived 15-year Rao's Q diversity using Landsat-7 based normalized difference vegetation index (NDV1) and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI). We evaluated the temporal turnover in Rao's Q on multiple land use classes, including agriculture, intact forest and areas affected by and invasive species. Vegetation index and Rao's Q diverged between pre- and post- monsoon seasons. Rao's Q had higher temporal turnover with NDVI than MSAVI for all vegetation dasses, however the latter showed higher sensitivity towards temperature and precipitation. Moreover, agriculture generally showed higher variability than forest and invasive species. The temporal turnover was correlated between NDVI and MSAVI for all vegetation classes, which indicated that the variability among vegetation types was directly related to spectral heterogeneity. Furthermore, MSAVI was less sensitive to the effect of soil in assessing the vegetation indices, which resulted in higher global sensitivity of Q(MSAVI). Near infrared and red spectra used in vegetation indices are able to capture a small variation in leaf traits reflectance for vegetation types. Here, the beta-diversities and their temporal dynamics derived from the vegetation indices differed based on their sensitivity to soil, vegetation density and seasonality. This approach and its open source implementation can be tested for different forest ecosystems at varying spatial scales.

AB  - Integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems explore synergistic interactions between soil, plant, and animals, maximizing land-use efficiency and sustainability. However, belowground dynamics under ICLF have not been investigated deeply, particularly the role of incorporating dead root material, a forefront strategy for releasing nutrients and storing carbon. To better understand belowground interactions, we conducted a 21 month assessment of fine-root growth and decomposition in an ICLF system, starting when Eucalyptus urograndis trees were three years old. Eucalyptus rows were spaced 15 m apart and integrated with annual crops and pasture. Distances of 1.9, 4.3, and 7.5 m from the trees were evaluated under two successional periods: (i) annual crop, when corn was interspaced with palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha); and (ii) pasture, when palisade grass was grazed. We used the minirhizotron technique to track fine-root production and decomposition down to a depth of 70 cm, capturing 2400 images. Root longevity was estimated per root diameter class (0-0.5-, 0.5-1.0-, and 1.0-2.0-mm) and phenotypical groups (e.g., grasses [corn + palisade grass] and Eucalyptus). Our data showed that root decomposition rate and necromass inputs into the soil were reduced at the closest distance from the Eucalyptus rows (i.e., 1.9 m). The incorporation of decomposed roots was higher in the topsoil (0-28 cm) and declined with increasing soil depths. The total decomposed root incorporation was 101 m m � 2 of soil image for 7.5 and 4.3 m inter-row positions, almost twice as high as the recorded at 1.9 m (54 m m-2) from the trees. Daily root decomposition rates increased during the last rainy season, benefited from numerous dead corn roots, and facilitated by higher soil moisture and temperature. Grasses and Eucalyptus roots at 7.5 m from the tree rows had shorter longevity than those at 1.9 m, remaining 88 and 152 days less, respectively. Root diameter influenced the decomposition rate as thicker roots (diameter between 1.0 and 2.0 mm) of grasses and Eucalyptus stood in the soil for 243 and 261 days longer than the finest roots (diameter <0.5 mm). Our results highlight that root necromass accretion and decomposition are heterogeneous in ICLF systems. Furthermore, 3-to-5-year-old Eucalyptus trees drive the interactions, creating microclimate conditions that impair corn and palisade grass root production and reduce root turnover close to the trees. These findings provide a scientific base for managing the ICLF system (spatial and temporal arrangements) and developing models of soil carbon addition via roots in such complex and heterogeneous systems.

AB  - The southeastern US has experienced an increase in the number of extreme heat events since the 1970s, due in part to global change. Despite rising temperatures, greater variability in weather has also led to more freeze events across parts of the Southeast, particularly during El Nino winters. Structural variation in forest stands and plant functional diversity can lead to localized micrometeorological differences that may alter the recovery of different forests from these temperature-induced disturbances. This variation can lead to differences in energy and entropy dynamics, which drive the metabolic response of these systems.
   Using thermodynamic metrics, we quantified metabolic energy and entropy production in response to extreme heat and freeze events at three longleaf pine savanna sites spanning an edaphic moisture gradient (i.e., xeric, intermediate, mesic). The sites also differed in anthropogenic legacy, with soil tillage occurring at the intermediate site, resulting in greater woody species abundance in the understory and overstory. We found that energy reserves in this ecosystem were built during low precipitation periods and when temperatures were below 20 degrees C. The mesic site, which had the highest plant functional diversity, exhibited an adaptive capacity to temperature extremes by maintaining low metabolic activity throughout temperature disturbances, while the intermediate and xeric sites started with high metabolic activity that gradually declined by similar to 15% with prolonged temperature extremes. Response to these temperature extremes was a function of hydrological drivers, as lower water availability reduced energy reserves during cold periods and photosynthetic activity during heatwaves - especially at the intermediate and xeric sites as a result of the high energy demand of oaks in the overstory. As climate change continues to alter weather patterns across the globe, it becomes increasingly important to assess metabolic resilience to greater weather variability as a function of ecosystem structure.

Pinus halepensis Mill., Quercus ilex L. and Quercus pubescens Willd. represent the dominant tree cover in the Mediterranean forests of southern France. However, their contributions to the French and global forest C and nitrogen (N) stocks are frequently overlooked and inaccurately quantified and little is known about to what extent the ongoing climate change can alter these stocks. We quantified the soil organic C (SOC) and N (SN) stocks in Mediterranean forests dominated by these tree species and evaluated to what extent an experimental precipitation reduction (about -30% yearly) affects these stocks and the litter decomposition efficiency. Litter mass losses were 55.7, 49.8 and 45.7% after 24 months of decomposition in Q. ilex, Q. pubescens and P. halepensis forests, respectively, and were 19% lower under drier climatic conditions. The SOC stocks were 14.0, 16.7 and 18.5 Mg ha(-1) and the SN stocks were 0.70, 0.93 and 0.88 Mg ha(-1) in Q. ilex, Q. pubescens and P. halepensis forests, respectively. The shallowness and stoniness of these Mediterranean forests could explain these limited stocks. By distinguishing the organic from the organo-mineral layer, we showed 74% less SOC in the organic layer of the P. halepensis forest under drier conditions, while no difference was detected in the organo-mineral layer or in the two oak forests. This last finding deserves further investigation and points out the necessity to distinguish the organic from the organo-mineral layer to detect the first impacts of climate change on SOC stocks.

AB  - Global warming threatens ecosystem functions, biodiversity, and rangeland productivity in Mongolia. The study analyzes the spatial and temporal distributions of the Net Primary Production (NPP) and its response to climatic parameters. The study also highlights how various land cover types respond to climatic fluctuations from 2003 to 2018. The Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) model was used to simulate the rangeland NPP of the last 16 years. Satellite remote sensing data products were mainly used as input for the model, where ground-based and MODIS NPP were used to validate the model result. The results indicated that the BEPS model was moderately effective (R-2 = 0.59, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 13.22 g C m(-2)) to estimate NPP for Mongolian rangelands (e.g., grassland and sparse vegetation). The validation results also showed good agreement between the BEPS and MODIS estimates for all vegetation types, including forest, shrubland, and wetland (R-2 = 0.65). The annual total NPP of Mongolia showed a slight increment with an annual increase of 0.0007 Pg (0.68 g C per meter square) from 2003 to 2018 (p = 0.82) due to the changes in climatic parameters and land cover change. Likewise, high increments per unit area found in forest NPP, while decreased NPP trend was observed in the shrubland. In conclusion, among the three climatic parameters, temperature was the factor with the largest influence on NPP variations (r = 0.917) followed precipitation (r = 0.825), and net radiation (r = 0.787). Forest and wetland NPP had a low response to precipitation, while inter-annual NPP variation shows grassland, shrubland, and sparse vegetation were highly sensitive rangeland types to climate fluctuations.

AB  - The study of litter can provide an important reference for understanding patterns of forest nutrient cycling and sustainable management. Here, we measured litterfall (leaves, branches, etc.) from a wet, evergreen, broad-leaved forest in Ailao Mountains of southwestern China on a monthly basis for 11 years (2005-2015). We measured the total biomass of litter fall as well as its components, and estimated the amount of C, N, P, K, S, Ca, and Mg in the amount of litterfall. We found that: The total litter of evergreen, broadleaved forest in Ailao Mountains from 2005 to 2015 was 7.70-9.46 t/ha, and the output of litterfall differed between years. This provides a safeguard for the soil fertility and biodiversity of the area. The total amount of litterfall and its components showed obvious seasonal variation, with most showing a bimodal pattern (peak from March to May and October to November). The majority of litterfall came from leaves, and the total amount as well as its components were correlated with meteorological factors (wind speed, temperate and precipitation) as well as extreme weather events. We found that among years, the nutrient concentration was sorted as C > Ca > N > K > Mg > S > P. The nutrient concentration in the fallen litter and the amount of nutrients returned showed a decreasing trend, but the decreasing rate was slowed through time. Nutrient cycling was influenced by meteorological factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed, but the nutrient utilization efficiency is high, the circulation capacity is strong, and the turnover time is short. Our results showed that although there was nutrient loss in this evergreen, broad-leaved forest, the presence of forest litterfall can effectively curb potential ecological problems in the area.

AB  - Mangroves support numerous ecosystem services and help in reducing coastal ecological risks, yet they are declining rapidly due to climate change, sea level fluctuations and human activities. It is important to understand their responses to climate and sea level changes and identify conservation target areas at spatio-temporal scales, specifically in regions of rich mangrove biodiversity. In this study, we predicted the potential impact of past (Middle Holocene, similar to 6000 years), current and future (2050s, 2070s; RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) climate change scenarios on the two dominant species in the coastal mangrove forest wetlands of India, i.e., Rhizophora mucronata and Avicennia officinalis through an ensemble species distribution modeling approach. The ensemble modeling has been carried out by integrating eight single algorithm methods. Based on the receiver operating characteristics of area under the curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) values the ensemble modeling has yielded the highest predictive performance for SVM for both the species and lowest by CART for R. mucronata and BIOCLIM for A. officinalis. The internal evaluation metrics of the resulting Species distribution models (SDMs) tested its robustness with AUC-0.97 and TSS-0.89 for A. officinalis and AUC-0.99 and TSS-0.90 for R. mucronata. Precipitation of Wettest Month (Bio 13) and Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (Bio 10) was the most important variable (54-67%) for the distribution of A. officinalis and Precipitation Seasonality (Bio 15) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (Bio 18) for R. mucronata. High precipitation and sea-level highstand during middle Holocene led to the maximum range expansion of suitable habitat for the mangrove species which is also validated in the present study by the fossil pollen datasets. Total mangrove habitat in current and future climatic scenarios decreased in 2.6 and 8.5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for 2050 and 2070 which indicates the vulnerability of the species to climate change impacts. Mangrove species are projected to shift their ranges more towards land in future experiencing a decrease in the amount of suitable coastal area available to them throughout the Indian coastline. The plausible cause for this range shift may be due to higher precipitation that is usually associated with longer period of soil inundation and because of the rise in sea level. Our findings will assist in formulating species-specific restoration plans for these keystone species in context of climate change in the Indian Subcontinent.

AB  - Plant-soil feedback (PSF), regulated by both mycorrhizae and soil-borne pathogens, is a primary mechanism maintaining high tree species diversity in the tropics. But how warming actually affects PSF is not well understood. We conducted a field warming experiment to test PSF on seedling mortality of two tree species: a rhizobia-associated tree (Ormosia semicastrata, Fabaceae) suffering from host-specific soil-borne pathogens and an ectomycorrhizal fungi-associated tree (Cyclobalanopsis patelliormis, Fagaceae) with low susceptibility to soil-borne pathogens. Soil fungi from the warming versus control seedling plots were identified by molecular sequencing. Results showed that the elevated temperature lowered seedling mortality of O. semicastrata, but had no effect on C. patelliormis seedlings. This indicates that warming weakened the negative PSF on O. semicastrata, presumably due to the observed decrease of the relative abundance of plant-pathogenic fungi and increase of ectomycorrhizal fungi but did not affect the PSF on C. patelliormis. The differential warming effects on seedling mortality of species with different microbial associations affords an example showcasing how the change in soil-borne microbes in response to global warming would, in turn, through PSF, alter tropical tree species composition and diversity. This study helps shed mechanistic light on the debate of biodiversity change as driven by climate change.

AB  - Drought-associated woody-plant mortality has been increasing in most regions with multi-decadal records and is projected to increase in the future, impacting terrestrial climate forcing, biodiversity and resource availability. The mechanisms underlying such mortality, however, are debated, owing to complex interactions between the drivers and the processes. In this Review, we synthesize knowledge of drought-related tree mortality under a warming and drying atmosphere with rising atmospheric CO2. Drought-associated mortality results from water and carbon depletion and declines in their fluxes relative to demand by living tissues. These pools and fluxes are interdependent and underlay plant defences against biotic agents. Death via failure to maintain a positive water balance is particularly dependent on soil-to-root conductance, capacitance, vulnerability to hydraulic failure, cuticular water losses and dehydration tolerance, all of which could be exacerbated by reduced carbon supply rates to support cellular survival or the carbon starvation process. The depletion of plant water and carbon pools is accelerated under rising vapour pressure deficit, but increasing CO2 can mitigate these impacts. Advancing knowledge and reducing predictive uncertainties requires the integration of carbon, water and defensive processes, and the use of a range of experimental and modelling approaches.
   Enhanced drought frequency and magnitude have impacted tree mortality, leading to multiple examples of regional-scale dieback. This Review outlines the mechanisms leading to mortality, including carbon starvation and hydraulic failure.

AB  - Soil water storage (SWS) is a key variable influencing hydrological processes and vegetation function in arid and semiarid regions. Although convincing evidence indicated that mixed forests have higher resistance and resil-ience to climate change and natural disturbance than monocultures, it is unclear how mixed-species plantations affect SWS. By conducting a meta-analysis of 1071 paired observations in mixed-species plantations and monoculture plantations from 45 studies, we showed that, on average, the SWS of mixed-species plantations at 0-500 cm was 10.81% higher than that of monoculture plantations. Importantly, these positive mixture effects increased over time, with greater positive effects in mixed tree and shrub plantations. The effects of mixed-species plantations on SWS shifted from positive to negative with increasing soil depth, and these mixing ef-fects in the topsoil layer (0-100 cm) became more pronounced with increasing stand age. However, the mixture effects on SWS did not vary with the mean annual temperature and precipitation. Moreover, mixed-species plantations were more conducive to enhancing the SWS capacity in areas with a low initial SWS. Structural equation models demonstrated that stand age was the main factor controlling the change in SWS, and soil depth also reduced the effect size of SWS by influencing the initial SWS. Our findings highlight that protecting and promoting functionally diverse forests improves SWS capacity, thereby alleviating soil moisture stress in arid and semiarid regions.

AB  - Brazil is a megadiverse country, with around 20 % of all known biodiversity in the world. This diversity is distributed in six major biomes that present different floristic characteristics.These environments suffer constant threats, and the knowledge about their communities is essential for conservation. Among the soil organisms, the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF - Glomeromycota) play a fundamental role in maintaining plant communities and are distributed in manifold environments, symbiotically associated to most terrestrial plants. The present synthesis brings the Brazilian records of 192 AMF species, belonging to 38 genera and 15 families, which represents circa 60 % of all diversity known in Glomeromycota. Most of the records of AMF species are in the Atlantic rainforest (153 species), Cerrado savanna (140), Caatinga dry forest (120) and the Amazon rainforest (97 species). Pantanal and Pampa so far have 19 and five AMF species, respectively. In general, Brazilian biomes harbor high AMF species richness, constituting an important repository of Glomeromycota taxa. The conservation of these areas is necessary to ensure the permanence of the native plant communities and associated fungi. Likewise, the importance of AMF diversity studies has to be emphasized, considering that these microorganisms are essential elements for the conservation of terrestrial environments and the survival of many threatened plant species.

AB  - This study was carried out in an area covered by the "Increasing retention capacity and prevention of floods and droughts in forest ecosystems in lowland areas" land drainage development project. The aim was to evaluate the impact of transformations in a habitat following the project's implementation on the structure of assemblages of epigeic ground beetles, in the context of the overall trend of decreasing biodiversity. The entomological observations were commenced before launching the planned hydro-technical development at the study area and were repeated 11 years later. During the two years of observations (2008 and 2019), 3311 specimens of ground beetles, representing 89 species, were captured. Water regulation affected the composition of ground beetle assemblages. After the small water retention program had been completed, a quantitative and qualitative decrease in ground beetles was observed. The groundwork for the development caused some disturbances in the habitat, leading to, amongst other things, higher soil moisture, which was conducive to the establishment of ground beetle assemblages other than those observed before the water retention project. After the hydro-technical objects had been constructed, the share of large and small zoophages with higher moisture preferences (hygrophilous species) increased, while the contribution of xerophilous hemizoophages decreased.

AB  - Rattan (Calamus spp.) is a high commercial value palm from the subfamily Calamoideae the primary source for cane in the well-developed rattan industry. Most studies on rattan have focused on its biodiversity, distribution, quality, strength, physical, mechanical, and morphological properties and genetics. Still, only a few have investigated the association of rattan with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. These mycorrhizal fungi are well known to play essential functions as promoting plant growth, maintaining plant community biodiversity and nutrient cycles in soil. This study aims to identify the established AM fungi community and their ecological interactions with Calamus spp. in the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex, Perak, Malaysia. Calamus spp. roots and their rhizospheric soil samples were collected from six sampling sites in the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex, one of the oldest rainforests in the world. The degree of mycorrhizal colonisation in Calamus spp. was evaluated using the grid lines method. At the same time, the AM fungi spore diversity in the rhizospheric soils were isolated using the wet sieving method and identified taxonomically analysed into different genera. Calamus insignis showed the highest degree of mycorrhizal colonisation amongst all the Calamus spp. present on the sampling sites. The AM fungi spores isolated from the rhizospheric soil from Belum-Temengor Forest Complex belonged to the genera Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, and Scutellospora. Glomus was the most frequently found genus in all the sampling sites. This study is the first record of the AM fungal diversity found in the Belum-Temengor Forest Complex.

AB  - The present study was conducted in the suburban forest "Seich Sou", which is located at the north-east of Thessaloniki city (north Greece). "Seich Sou" is one of the most significant suburban forests of North Greece. However, many disastrous events have taken place in the suburban forest during the last 25 years, caused by either human interference or other biotic/abiotic factors, such as insect outbreaks. In the present study, erosion measurements and field data were collected using a combination of silt fences (USLE plots) and depositions retained behind the constructed check-dams, aiming to monitor the impact of the significant biotic and abiotic disturbances (forest fires, insect outbreaks, logging) in Seich Sou forest. Specifically, the aim of this study is to present a cost-effective and time saving methodology towards the achievement of accurate and reliable soil erosion measurements and field data acquisition. Additionally, the installation details, data recording and collection, field work, supplementary materials and the advantages of silt fences and check-dams are presented in detail, as well as the limitations of the methods and the difficulties during the installation, maintenance and data collection period. The proposed methodology could be effectively applied in many environments and in the context of varied purposes, to quantify the erosion and runoff processes with high accuracy, as well as to increase the accuracy of soil erosion modeling performance, through implementation of calibration and/or validation processes, which is a major issue for the scientific community.

AB  - The impacts of reduced precipitation on plant functional diversity and how its components (richness, evenness, divergence and composition) modulate the Amazon carbon balance remain elusive. We present a novel trait -based approach, the CArbon and Ecosystem functional-Trait Evaluation (CAETE) model to investigate the role of plant trait diversity in representing vegetation carbon (C) storage and net primary productivity (NPP) in current climatic conditions. We assess impacts of plant functional diversity on vegetation C storage under low precipitation in the Amazon basin, by employing two approaches (low and high plant trait diversity, respec-tively): (i) a plant functional type (PFT) approach comprising three PFTs, and (ii) a trait-based approach rep-resenting 3000 plant life strategies (PLSs). The PFTs/PLSs are defined by combinations of six traits: C allocation and residence time in leaves, wood, and fine roots. We found that including trait variability improved the model's performance in representing NPP and vegetation C storage in the Amazon. When considering the whole basin, simulated reductions in precipitation caused vegetation C storage loss by similar to 60% for both model ap-proaches, while the PFT approach simulated a more widespread C loss and abrupt changes in neighboring grid cells. We found that owing to high trait variability in the trait-based approach, the plant community was able to functionally reorganize itself via changes in the relative abundance of different plant life strategies, which therefore resulted in the emergence of previously rare trait combinations in the model simulation. The trait-based approach yielded strategies that invest more heavily in fine roots to deal with limited water availability, which allowed the occupation of grid cells where none of the PFTs were able to establish. The prioritization of root investment at the expense of other tissues in response to drought has been observed in other studies. However, the higher investment in roots also had consequences: it resulted, for the trait-based approach, in a higher root: shoot ratio (a mean increase of 74.74%) leading to a lower vegetation C storage in some grid cells. Our findings highlight that accounting for plant functional diversity is crucial when evaluating the sensitivity of the Amazon forest to climate change, and therefore allow for a more mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity for tropical forest ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The increased frequency and severity of drought has heightened concerns over the risk of hydraulic vegetative stress and the premature mortality of ecosystems globally. Unfortunately, most land surface models (LSMs) continue to un-derestimate ecosystem resilience to drought - which degrades the credibility of model-predicted ecohydrological re-sponses to climate change. This study investigates the response of vegetation gross productivity to water-stress conditions using microwave-based vegetation optical depth (VOD) and soil moisture retrievals. Based on the estimated isohydric/anisohydric spectrum, we find that vegetation at isohydric state exhibits a larger decrease in gross primary productivity and higher water use efficiency than anisohydric vegetation due to their more rigorous stomatal control and higher tolerance of carbon starvation risk. In addition, the introduction of microwave soil moisture improves the accuracy of isohydricity/anisohydricity estimates compared to those obtained using microwave VOD alone (i.e., increases their Spearman rank correlation versus the benchmark of Global Biodiversity Information Facility dataset from 0.12 to 0.63). Results of this study provide clear justification for the use of microwave-based soil moisture retrievals to enhance stomatal conductance parameterization within LSMs.

AB  - To assess the quality of atmospheric air, the authors propose to apply the process of dry deposition of impurities on an artificial underlying surface that binds impurities in contact with it. The mass of these impurities is calculated upon laboratory exposure, after being transferred to an aqueous solution. The ease of absorber fabrication and the low cost facilitate the monitoring of air pollution at various points in woodlands, where the stationary stations for air-pollution-monitoring are very difficult and costly to arrange. A large number of control points makes it possible to identify forest areas with the highest levels of air pollution. A dynamic air-quality study at one of the monitoring points is necessary and sufficient to determine the concentration of impurities. The authors surveyed an urban forest using the proposed method, and the survey results confirmed that areas with an elevated concentration of airborne nitrogen dioxide exist within the woodland. This can lead to soil eutrophication and changes in forest biodiversity at the species and ecosystem levels.

AB  - Biodiversity plays a pivotal role in forest productivity and, through it, on the provision of ecosystem services. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms by which biodiversity drives productivity is a challenge for sustainable forest management. It has been proposed that functional dissimilarity can increase forest productivity, particularly in water-limited ecosystems (as Mediterranean forests), where water stress might increase complementarity resource use among species (hypothesis of niche complementarity). Alternatively, strongly water-limited forests may favor the dominance of woody species with slow-growth and conservative resource-use trait values, which in turn, might increase plant community productivity proportionally to their biomass (hypothesis of mass-ratio). The effects of such mechanisms on productivity is yet understudied in water-limited forests. We assessed the effect of both previously described mechanisms on productivity in a semi-arid Mediterranean-type climate matorral of Chile through a trait-based approach. We hypothesized that: (1) higher dissimilarity of functional trait values of crowns, mots and phenology among woody species increases community productivity. Alternatively, (2) higher dominance of woody species of conservative trait values increases forest productivity. We installed twenty-three 25 x 25 m plots in the matorral of the National Reserve of "Robletia de Los Cobres de Loncha" located in the Coastal Range. Forest productivity was estimated as aboveground biomass changes between 2010 and 2017. The mean species pairwise dissimilarity (MPD) and the community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) were calculated for each single trait as surrogates of the hypotheses of niche complementarity and mass-ratio, respectively. Environmental variables (e.g. altitude, slope, precipitation) were included as potential drivers influencing productivity. We performed a selection procedure of multiple linear regression models based on the Akaike Information Criterion. Our findings show that higher forest productivity was related with higher trait similarity of plant maximum height and onset of growth among species. Besides, productivity increased with CWM values that reflect greater dominance of species exhibiting acquisitive traits (i.e. greater maximum plant height, lower wood density and earlier onset of growth) rather than conservative traits. Moreover, forest productivity increased with increasing altitude, precipitation and decreasing temperatures from 300 to 900 m. Therefore, in contrast with our hypotheses, productivity increased by greater trait similarity among dominant highly-competitive species - which might be favored by mesic conditions at middle altitudes of the Coastal Range. The sustainable management of semi-arid Mediterranean forests with the main focus on productivity should promote higher dominance of highly-competitive species with similar functional trait values in mesic conditions, and conservative species with greater trait functional dissimilarity to increase drought resistance in stressful environments.

AB  - The soil microbial community (SMC) provides critical ecosystem services including organic matter decomposition, soil structural formation, and nutrient cycling. Studies suggest plants, specifically trees, act as soil keystone species controlling SMC structure via multiple mechanisms (e.g., litter chemistry, root exudates, and canopy alteration of precipitation). Tree influence on SMC is shaped by local/regional climate effects on forested environments and the connection of forests to surrounding landscapes (e.g., urbanization). Urban soils offer an ideal analog to assess the influence of environmental conditions versus plant species-specific controls on SMC. We used next generation high throughput sequencing to characterize the SMC of specific tree species (Fagus grandifolia [beech] vs Liriodendron tulipifera [yellow poplar]) across an urban-rural gradient. Results indicate SMC dissimilarity within rural forests suggests the SMC is unique to individual tree species. However, greater urbanization pressure increased SMC similarity between tree species. Relative abundance, species richness, and evenness suggest that increases in similarity within urban forests is not the result of biodiversity loss, but rather due to greater overlap of shared taxa. Evaluation of soil chemistry across the rural-urban gradient indicate pH, Ca+, and organic matter are largely responsible for driving relative abundance of specific SMC members.

AB  - Over 150 species of earthworms are known from the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest, but many more are expected to live in this megadiverse biome. In the present study, we evaluated earthworm species occurrence and diversity in native and reforested areas in four National Forests in three Brazilian states: Tres Barras National Forest (Santa Catarina), Irati and Pirai do Sul National Forests (Parana) and Capao Bonito National Forest (Sao Paulo) using formalin and hand sorting methods. A total of 13 species were found, five exotic and eight natives (of which four were new, undescribed species), belonging to six genera and five families (Rhinodrilidae, Glossoscolecidae, Ocnerodrilidae, Benhamiidae, Megascolecidae). In general, higher number of earthworms were collected in Araucaria plantations, except in Capao Bonito where Pinus sp. plantations had higher abundance. Hand sorting also collected more species in all forests, so this should be the preferred sampling method to evaluate earthworm communities. Formalin extraction was efficient only for epi-endogeic earthworms, most of them exotic species. Exotic pine species plantations tend to reduce species richness and abundance, compared with native forests and Araucaria plantations, and substitution of native vegetation for pine plantations should consider potential negative effects on soil animal populations.

AB  - Metabolomics provides an unprecedented window into diverse plant secondary metabolites that represent a potentially critical niche dimension in tropical forests underlying species coexistence. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics to evaluate chemical composition of 358 tree species and its relationship with phylogeny and variation in light environment, soil nutrients, and insect herbivore leaf damage in a tropical rainforest plot. We report no phylogenetic signal in most compound classes, indicating rapid diversification in tree metabolomes. We found that locally co-occurring species were more chemically dissimilar than random and that local chemical dispersion and metabolite diversity were associated with lower herbivory, especially that of specialist insect herbivores. Our results highlight the role of secondary metabolites in mediating plant-herbivore interactions and their potential to facilitate niche differentiation in a manner that contributes to species coexistence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that specialist herbivore pressure is an important mechanism promoting phytochemical diversity in tropical forests.
   We leveraged these innovations in untargeted metabolomics to study the foliar metabolomes of 358 tree species to evaluate the interaction between the abiotic environment, metabolite diversity, and herbivore damage due to specialist and generalist insect herbivores. Our results suggest that plant neighbourhoods with diverse secondary metabolites reduce the rate of damage by herbivores, especially specialist herbivores with limited host ranges and the potential for density-dependent impacts on plants. The role of specialist herbivores in promoting local neighbourhoods of chemically dissimilar and diverse trees suggests that chemically mediated plant-herbivore interactions represent a key component of the niche with the potential to contribute to the maintenance of tree species diversity in tropical forests.image

AB  - Agricultural production has replaced natural ecosystems across the planet, becoming a major driver of carbon emissions, biodiversity loss, and freshwater consumption. Here we combined global crop yield and environmental data in a -1-million-dimensional mathematical optimisation framework to determine how optimising the spatial distribution of global croplands could reduce environmental impacts whilst maintaining current crop production levels. We estimate that relocating current croplands to optimal locations, whilst allowing ecosystems in then-abandoned areas to regenerate, could simultaneously decrease the current carbon, biodiversity, and irrigation water footprint of global crop production by 71%, 87%, and 100%, respectively, assuming high-input farming on newly established sites. The optimal global distribution of crops is largely similar for current and end-of-century climatic conditions across emission scenarios. Substantial impact reductions could already be achieved by relocating only a small proportion of worldwide crop production, relocating croplands only within national borders, and assuming less intensive farming systems.

AB  - The structure and function of many forest ecosystems will be modified as a result of air pollution and climate change. Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) forests are among the first terrestrial ecosystems to respond to this change. We analysed how changes in climate and environmental factors will affect vegetation cover in Norway spruce forests and whether it is possible to assemble a list of diagnostically important/sensitive species that would be the first to react to changes in habitats of Norway spruce in Central Balkan. Significant changes in the vegetation cover of Norway spruce forests are mainly influenced by temperature increases (approximate to 4 degrees C), and precipitation decreases (approximate to 102 mm) by the end of the 21st century. Projections show that vegetation cover changes and future habitat conditions for Norway spruce forests on podzolic brown soils with a low base saturation and soil pH decreases, and temperature growth and precipitation decline, with the worst in the Rodope montane forest ecoregion. In Dinaric Mountain and Balkan mixed forest ecoregions, the range of natural occurrence of Norway spruce forest will shift to higher altitudes, or to the north. One of the cognitions of this paper is that, through available environmental models and their indices, species from the IUCN Red List should be recognised more properly and included in model calculations.

AB  - It has been widely reported that biodiversity, ecosystems, and functional traits are positively interrelated in natural forest ecosystems. However, it remains unclear whether these relationships should be expected in secondary forests. In this study, we hypothesized that the multifunctionality (EMF) is affected by the climate dependency of tree-species diversity and stand attribute diversity in a secondary forest dominated by Pinus yunnanensis. By using forest inventory data from a wide range of areas, we quantified the aboveground biomass, soil organic carbon, ratio of soil carbon and nitrogen, total soil nitrogen, total soil phosphorus, total soil potassium, tree-species diversity, and stand attribute diversity (i.e., individual tree-size variations). We also quantified the climate data, including the mean annual temperature (MAT), and mean annual precipitation (MAP). We found that a higher MAT directly constrains all the ecosystem multifunctionalities (EMFs) and three of the five single functions. A higher MAP was negatively correlated with all the EMFs and four of the five single functions, but indirectly through diversity indices. Stand attribute diversity better explained the EMFs rather than tree species diversity. Meanwhile, most of the single functions were highly correlated with stand attribute diversity rather than tree species diversity. These results highlight the importance of diversity in promoting forest multifunctionality and underscore the importance of the climate context in defining EMF and shaping the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functions. We argue that the climate context should be taken into account when maximizing forest complexity, so as to enhance the multifunctionality of Pinus yunnanensis secondary forests.

AB  - Halting biological invasions and rewilding extirpated native fauna are conservation interventions to bolster biodiversity, species interactions, and ecosystems. These actions are often considered separately and the potential for reintroduced wildlife to facilitate invasive plants has been largely overlooked. Here, we investigated the role of Singapore's recolonizing native wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in facilitating an invasive weed Miconia crenata into tropical rainforests, which are normally highly resistant to invasion. We conducted line-transect surveys in 11 Singaporean rain forests and used generalized linear mixed models to consider the contribution of pigs' soil disturbances, human forest paths, and other environmental covariates, on the density of M. crenata. We found that M. crenata was more abundant at forest edges and invasion into forest interior was facilitated by pigs, paths, and canopy gaps, but that these effects were all additive, not synergistic (i.e., not multiplicative). These results highlight how modern invasions are driven by multiple disturbances as well as propagule pressure (e.g., urban birds dispersing seeds at forest edges where they establish in pig soil disturbances). Singapore's extensive native forest restoration efforts may have provided plentiful edge and secondary forests that are well suited to pigs and M. crenata, which in turn undermine the aims of fostering later-successional native plant communities. To prevent negative externalities, we suggest that plant restoration and rewilding projects consider the potential role of wildlife in facilitating non-native plants, and couple these actions with preliminary screening of unintended consequences and continued monitoring, as well as limiting human-mediated weed invasion to minimize propagule sources.

AB  - In intact ecosystems, factors such as herbivory and light and water availability affect seedling establishment. Land-use change and climate change are now affecting forests globally, influencing seedling establishment directly via changes in light availability and precipitation and indirectly by affecting herbivory. The present study evaluated the ecological complexity of seedling establishment in response to interactions between these factors. The growth and survival of a pioneer species and two later successional species were measured in a factorial experiment testing the effects of land-use change, water availability, and herbivory. The study was conducted on Mt. Gorongosa in central Mozambique, a protected area that is experiencing high levels of land-use change and is in need of forest restoration. The pioneer species, Erythrina lysistemon, gained the most height in undisturbed, shaded environments where it invested resources in accessing light. Erythrina lysistemon grew the most in diameter in open areas. Khaya anthotheca, a later successional species, gained more biomass in disturbed, high light areas. The growth of Millettia stuhlmannii, another later successional species, was not affected by light. Drought conditions reduced survival of the later successional species, while flooding limited the survival of the pioneer species. Herbivory increased in disturbed areas and was nega-tively correlated with E. lysistemon root biomass. In summary, this study indicates land-use change and cli-mate change may alter seedling establishment and community composition. Restoration efforts should focus on increasing seedling survival because although survival is limited in disturbed sites, seedlings that do sur-vive grow successfully.& COPY; 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of SAAB.

AB  - Termites are important ecosystem engineers in tropical habitats, with different feeding groups able to decompose wood, grass, litter, and soil organic matter. In most tropical regions, termite abundance and species diversity are assumed to increase with rainfall, with highest levels found in rainforests. However, in the Australian tropics, this pattern is thought to be reversed, with lower species richness and termite abundance found in rainforest than drier habitats. The potential mechanisms underlying this pattern remain unclear. We compared termite assemblages (abundance, activity, diversity, and feeding group composition) across five sites along a precipitation gradient (ranging from similar to 800 to 4,000 mm annual rainfall), spanning dry and wet savanna habitats, wet sclerophyll, and lowland and upland rainforests in tropical North Queensland. Moving from dry to wet habitats, we observed dramatic decreases in termite abundance in both mounds and dead wood occupancy, with greater abundance and activity at savanna sites (low precipitation) compared with rainforest or sclerophyll sites (high precipitation). We also observed a turnover in termite species and feeding group diversity across sites that were close together, but in different habitats. Termite species and feeding group richness were highest in savanna sites, with 13 termite species from wood-, litter-, grass-, dung-, and soil-feeding groups, while only five termite species were encountered in rainforest and wet sclerophyll sites-all wood feeders. These results suggest that the Australian termite diversity anomaly may be partly driven by how specific feeding groups colonized habitats across Australia. Consequently, termites in Australian rainforests may be less important in ecosystem processes, such as carbon and nutrient cycling during decomposition, compared with termites in other tropical rainforests.

AB  - Rubber plantation has become one of the most dominant human-modified landscape features in continental Southeast Asia. Xishuangbanna, a monsoonal tropical region of southern Yunnan in China, is a hotspot of rubber cultivation and represents the northern margins of rubber expansion in Asia. Here, we compared the species richness, beta diversity patterns, and assemblage composition of ants from a rubber plantation and two forest types (alluvial and limestone forest) common in Xishuangbanna. We hypothesized that species richness is higher in forest habitats than the rubber plantation. Due to habitat similarities between the limestone forest and the rubber plantation (tree defoliation, dry condition, thinner soil), we hypothesized that ant assemblages in these habitats are similar, and beta diversity is driven by nestedness. We found the highest ant species richness in the alluvial forest, followed by the limestone forest and rubber plantation. Ant assemblages were similar between alluvial and limestone forests but different in the rubber plantation. Beta diversity estimation showed that beta diversity patterns were driven by species turnover in all three habitats. Our results showed that the rubber plantation was species-poor and harbored unique ant assemblages compared to forest habitats. Moreover, the assemblages in the rubber plantation were often dominated by numerically dominant and aggressive taxa. Our study highlights: biodiversity changes associated with forest conversion into monoculture rubber plantations; the conservation value of limestone forests, a common yet understudied forest type in Southeast Asia; and the importance of considering species identities when determining the impacts of habitat modification on ant diversity.

AB  - Wildlife conservation perspective generally refers to the attitude of local people living in and around protected areas towards conservation of wild animals and plant species in their natural habitat. Socio-economic dependency of rural communities on natural resources very often for livelihood purposes leads to negative attitudes towards conservation. Rising human population, intensified land use, human pressure on animals, modification of natural resources, habitat fragmentation and lack of foresight in the implementation of policies have been linked with disputes affecting the rural communities living in and around protected areas and their socioeconomic development. Information on perceptions and attitudes of local communities is important to identify proper management programmes and strategies that best suit the conservation of biodiversity alongside the socio-economic development of local communities dependent on forests for their livelihood. Borail Wildlife Sanctuary is the only wildlife sanctuary in the southern part of Assam. The sanctuary is important biologically as it supports the Cachar Tropical Evergreen Forest and many rare and unique species. In recent times, anthropogenic pressure on forest and wildlife is on the rise because of the increasing human population around the sanctuary. In the present study, conservation studies were undertaken among the fringe villagers of Borail Wildlife Sanctuary (i) to understand attitude and perception towards forest and wildlife conservation, and (ii) to assess their socio-economic dependency on forest and wildlife. The fringe villagers of Borail Wildlife Sanctuary were found to possess a positive attitude towards the sanctuary as a wholewhich is essential for participatory conservation and management programme in this protected area situated in the vulnerable eco-region of north east India. The dominance of utilitarian value among the local communities indicate towards their social and economic dependency on the Borail Wildlife Sanctuary, particularly for collecting firewood, constructing huts (kutcha houses), cultivation of beetle vine (pan jhum) etc. Acceleration of soil erosion and accentuation in the variability of rainfall distribution as a result of long term shifting cultivation in Borail Wildlife Sanctuary might be detrimental for conservation of wildlife and biodiversity. This necessitates sanctuary-community interaction for strengthening the sanctuary-community relationship in order to persuade the local communities to take up alternative forms of livelihood in order to protect the sanctuary. However, the local villagers were not willing to take part in the current conservation activities which may be attributed to their low level of education and lack of environmental awareness. The traditional beliefs of a section of fringe villagers particularly in protecting non-human primates and banyan trees hold key to participatory wildlife and biodiversity conservation programmes, which the government agencies, policymakers as well as non-governmental organizations might utilize for successful protected area management coupled with enhanced education and creation of awareness among local communities. Moreover, creation of wildlife corridors across the national highway might help save many wild animals of the Borail Wildlife Sanctuary (which is particularly rich in reptile biodiversity) from road kills by speeding vehicles.

AB  - We hypothesized that soil phosphorus (P) utilization might be tightly associated with interspecific interactions. To clarify this issue, a maize-grass pea intercropping system was investigated in a rainfed field with P addition (P0 and P +), water (rain-fed and plastic film mulching) and isolation (root barrier and root intermingling) treatments. The data indicated that total net effect was higher than 0 under all the conditions, displaying facilitative effects of biodiversity on agroecosystem productivity. The dynamics of total land equivalent ratio demonstrated that the intensity of plant-plant facilitation became greater under P-deficient condition. Maize was the facilitated species consistently, while grass pea changed from facilitated species under low soil P and moisture to facilitator under high soil P and moisture. The driving mechanism was associated with soil acidi-fication and microbial community promotion effect under P-deficient condition. Intercropped rhizosphere soil phosphatase activity was increased by 4.9-17.2%, and Olsen-P availability was evidently enhanced relative to monoculture. Interestingly, drought stress significantly enhanced this trend. Critically, root isolation confirmed that plant-plant facilitation was briefly driven by interspecific rhizosphere interactions. Conclusively, this study confirmed the context-dependent facilitation shift in agroecosystem and provided a novel insight into the importance of rhizosphere interaction on soil P availability and utilization.

AB  - In the actual context of global change and biodiversity depletion, soil bioengineering represents an important tool for riparian ecosystem restoration and species conservation. Various techniques have already been implemented, but their adaptation still must be carried out in Caribbean Islands biodiversity hotspots, where suitable species remains unknown. Nitrogen-fixing legumes are particularly relevant for ecological restoration and the diversity of native Caribbean legume trees is promising in the search for suitable species for soil bioengineering. We hypothesized that Caribbean legume tree species present a growth performance and set of biotechnical traits compatible with their use in soil bioengineering. We selected five native legume trees, adapted to riparian environments, in different ecosystems (swamp forest, evergreen seasonal forest, rainforest) based on their ecology, resistance to disturbance and seed production characteristics. We measured root traits relevant for soil bioengineering on nursery grown 3-month-old seedlings. Despite their differences in sensitivity to herbivory and in growth strategies, the selected species have a high potential for use in soil bioengineering, with high seed production, high germination rates-from 88 to 100%-, and 100% survival rates, and are therefore compatible with large scale plant material production. We provided practical guidance tools for their integration into soil bioengineering techniques.

AB  - Ecotones linking open and forested habitats contain multiple microhabitats with varying vegetal structures and microclimatic regimes. Ecotones host many insect species whose development is intimately linked to the microcli-matic conditions where they grow (e.g., the leaves of their host plants and the surrounding air). Yet microclimatic heterogeneity at these fine scales and its effects on insects remain poorly quantified for most species. Here we studied how interspecific differences in the use of microhabitats across ecotones lead to contrasting thermal exposure and survival costs between two closely-related butterflies (Pieris napi and P. rapae). We first assessed whether butterflies selected different microhabitats to oviposit and quantified the thermal condi-tions at the microhabitat and foliar scales. We also assessed concurrent changes in the quality and availability of host plants. Finally, we quantified larval time of death under different experimental temperatures (thermal death time [TDT] curves) to predict their thermal mortality considering both the intensity and the duration of the microclimatic heat challenges in the field. We identified six processes determining larval thermal exposure at fine scales associated with butterfly oviposition behavior, canopy shading, and heat and water fluxes at the soil and foliar levels. Leaves in open microhabitats could reach temperatures 3-10 degrees C warmer than the surrounding air while more closed microhabitats presented more buffered and homogeneous temperatures. Interspecific differences in microhabitat use matched the TDT curves and the thermal mortality in the field. Open microhabitats posed acute heat challenges that were better withstood by the thermotolerant butterfly, P. rapae, where the species mainly laid their eggs. Despite being more thermosensitive, P. napi was predicted to present higher survivals than P. rapae due to the thermal buffering provided by their selected microhabitats. However, its offspring could be more vulnerable to host-plant scarcity during summer drought periods. Overall, the different interaction of the butterflies with microclimatic and host-plant variation emerging at fine scales and their different thermal sensitivity posed them contrasting heat and resource challenges. Our results contribute to setting a new framework that predicts insect vulnerability to climate change based on their thermal sensitivity and the intensity, duration, and accumulation of their heat exposure.

AB  - Wetlands provide important ecosystem services, such as water conservation, biodiversity protection, and carbon sequestration. The Zoige alpine wetland is the largest high-altitude swamp in the world and plays a critical role in regional ecological balance and climate change. However, little is known about the fate of its soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. In this study, we estimated the degradation status of the wetland over the past 35 years and used machine learning to investigate the dynamics and driving factors of SOC at different soil depths of the Zoige wetland in 1985, 2000, and 2020. We also simulated the future SOC balance under different scenarios. The results showed that the area of Zoige wetland has degraded by 378.71 km2 in the past 35 years. Increased precipitation and solar radiation offset the adverse effects of global warming, making the soil act as a carbon sink in the past 35 years. The total SOC storage of the wetland soils in 1985, 2000, and 2020 was estimated to be 2.03 Pg, 2.05 Pg, and 2.21 Pg, respectively, with 46.95% of SOC distributed in the subsoil layers. Climate change was the most important driving factor controlling the SOC storage of the Zoige wetland, explaining 51.33% of the SOC changes in the soil. Temperature change was always the most important factor controlling wetland SOC, and precipitation had a greater impact on the topsoil. Under the temperature control targets of 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C, the SOC pool of the Zoige wetland will decrease by 60.21 Tg C and 69.19 Tg C, respectively. Under scenarios of a 10% and 20% increase in precipitation, the wetland soil will accumulate an additional 46.53 Tg C and 118.89 Tg C, respectively. The study results provide important references for the sustainable management of the Zoige wetland under the background of global climate change.

AB  - The spatiotemporal change in the alpine timberline, an ecosystem ecotone, is an ideal indicator for use in climate change research. In order to gain a quantitative understanding of the response of the alpine timberline to climate change, the Hengduan Mountains region of China was selected as a study area and a series of 136 Landsat images covering this area that were acquired in 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015 were collected. First, the alpine timberline was retrieved and the spatiotemporal dynamics of the timberline were explored. The effect of topography on the location of the alpine timberline was also analyzed. The results indicate that the average elevation of the timberline increased by about 55 (+/- 8.54) m from 3992.58 m in 1985 to 4047.60 m in 2015; however, there was obvious spatial heterogeneity in these changes. On the whole, the average elevation of the timberline on shaded slopes (northern, northeastern, and northwestern slopes) were found to be about 160 m higher than on sunward slopes (southern, southeastern, and southwestern slopes). It was also found that, over the period 1985-2015, there has been an obvious acceleration in the upward tendency of the alpine timberline. Finally, the climate variables that are driving this timberline shift were identified and evaluated using the partial least squares (PLS) regression method. The results indicate that the average annual temperature (TEM_Year), total precipitation during the growing season (PRE_Grow), and growing season temperature (TEM_Grow) were the significant positive factors driving the rise in the timberline elevation; the total annual precipitation (PRE_Year) was found to have an unexpected negative influence. Besides, other climatic factors (e.g., strong winds) and non-climate variables (e.g., human influence and soil properties) should be also included in future related studies to enhance the understanding of the link between forest vegetation and climate change under extreme conditions.

AB  - Seedling recruitment is a bottleneck for population dynamics and range shift. The vital rates linked to recruitment by seed are impacted by amplified drought induced by climate change. In the Mediterranean region, autumn and winter seedling emergence and mortality may have strong impact on the overall seedling recruitment. However, studies focusing on the temporal dynamic of recruitment during these seasons are rare. This study was performed in a deciduous Mediterranean oak forest located in southern France and quantifies the impact of amplified drought conditions on autumn and winter seedling emergence and seedling mortality rates of two herbaceous plant species with meso-Mediterranean and supra-Mediterranean distribution (respectively, Silene italica and Silene nutans). Seedlings were followed from October 2019 to May 2020 in both undisturbed and disturbed plots where the litter and the aboveground biomass have been removed to create open microsites. Amplified drought conditions reduced seedling emergence and increased seedling mortality for both Silene species but these negative effects were dependent on soil disturbance conditions. Emergence of S. italica decreased only in undisturbed plots (-7%) whereas emergence of S. nutans decreased only in disturbed plots (-10%) under amplified drought conditions. The seedling mortality rate of S. italica was 51% higher under amplified drought conditions in undisturbed plots while that of S. nutans was 38% higher in disturbed plots. Aridification due to lower precipitation in the Mediterranean region will negatively impact the seedling recruitment of these two Silene species. Climate change effects on early vital rates may likely have major negative impacts on the overall population dynamic.

AB  - Fungi are highly diverse organisms, which provide multiple ecosystem services. However, compared with charismatic animals and plants, the distribution patterns and conservation needs of fungi have been little explored. Here, we examined endemicity patterns, global change vulnerability and conservation priority areas for functional groups of soil fungi based on six global surveys using a high-resolution, long-read metabarcoding approach. We found that the endemicity of all fungi and most functional groups peaks in tropical habitats, including Amazonia, Yucatan, West-Central Africa, Sri Lanka, and New Caledonia, with a negligible island effect compared with plants and animals. We also found that fungi are predominantly vulnerable to drought, heat and land-cover change, particularly in dry tropical regions with high human population density. Fungal conservation areas of highest priority include herbaceous wetlands, tropical forests, and woodlands. We stress that more attention should be focused on the conservation of fungi, especially root symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi in tropical regions as well as unicellular early-diverging groups and macrofungi in general. Given the low overlap between the endemicity of fungi and macroorganisms, but high conservation needs in both groups, detailed analyses on distribution and conservation requirements are warranted for other microorganisms and soil organisms.

AB  - Ecosystem services relies on several insects that provide fundamental functions. Despite the quality of these ecosystem services depends on insect diversity, abundance and biomass, little is known about the effects that individual body condition has over such services. One prediction is that starving or sick animals may provide a reduced service. Dung beetles bury dung in forests and cattle farms, contributing to soil fertilization and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from livestock. However, some species are highly sensitive to habitat disturbance and this leads to important losses of ecosystem services in disturbed areas. Here we experimentally tested the effect of diet quality and parasite pressure impact on dung removal rate using three species of dung beetles from contrasting habitats. We exposed wild beetles to an immune challenge combined with experimental diets that varied in protein content. We predicted that dung removal would be better carried out by healthy and well-fed individuals. However, if a species incurs in compensatory feeding or terminal investment in reproduction, ill individuals will still exhibit intense dung removal and reproductive activity but with a physiological cost. For Euoniticellus intermedius beetles, the immune challenge reduced dung removal rates, and this was because the challenge reduced the weight, although not the number of built brood masses. This suggests that implanted individuals made an intense reproductive effort. Therefore, a strategy of terminal investment in reproduction might be occurring. In the same species, couples fed low-protein diets increased dung removal rates compared to control-fed animals, probably as a compensatory feeding strategy that increased energetic condition. Conversely, Onthophagus incensus and O. rhinolophus beetles did not change dung removal rates despite suffering changes in energetic condition resulting from treatment. This is the first evidence that ecosystem services provided by dung beetles depend on individual health and nutritional status that drive reproductive and feeding behavior. Understanding the environmental factors that affect individual physiology and behavior is fundamental to guarantee conditions not only for the survival of key species but also for the maintenance of ecosystem services.

AB  - Our understanding of how environmental heterogeneity shapes plant community dynamics is largely based on above-ground diversity despite the importance of seed banks as reservoirs of genetic and taxonomic diversity that buffer plant populations and influence vegetation following disturbance. Using a plant functional trait approach, this study examined the importance of fire-related germination cues and environmental determinants of plant community turnover in wet forests of south-eastern Australia - forests of both high conservation value and the focus of current timber harvesting. We surveyed extant vegetation, soil seed banks, forest structure and edaphic properties across 62 sites burnt in 1939 and not subsequently affected by wildfire or logging. A total of 46 families, and 99 species were identified in extant vegetation with 43 and 126 respectively in the soil seed bank, with only 32% of species co-occurring in both species' pools. Despite historically long fire return intervals, the soil seed bank demonstrated a clear positive response to fire-related germination cues (heat in combination with smoke) that were concentrated in hard-seeded species dispersed by ants. Seeds from early successional species showed no response to fire cues, while species typical of the wetter margins of these forests were killed by high heat. The soil seed bank was dominated by species associated with early successional stages, consistent with the initial floristics model of succession. Woody species were largely restricted to extant vegetation and replacement is most likely to occur from future seed rain. Spatially structured environmental heterogeneity shaped plant turnover with the relative strength of environmental controls differing among functional types and pools of diversity. Differential response of the combined species pool relative to extant vegetation demonstrates that the soil seed bank provides a storage effect. Forest management practices that generate patchy and heterogenous environments, including the intensity of regeneration burns and density of overstorey species, will benefit biodiversity conservation through overstorey structural controls on resource availability and diversity of understorey vegetation, that is transferred to soil seed banks via tight abiotic controls and seed inputs.

AB  - High biodiversity and endemism combined with persistently high deforestation rates mark Madagascar as one of the hottest biodiversity hot spots. Contemporary rising interest in large-scale reforestation, both globally and throughout Madagascar itself, presents a promising impetus for forest restoration and biodiversity conservation across the island. However, Madagascar may face unique restoration challenges due to its equally unique eco-evolutionary trajectory, which must be understood to enable successful ecological restoration. We conducted a systematic review of potential barriers to restoration for terrestrial forest biomes (rain forests, dry forests, and subhumid highland forests) in Madagascar. Our results indicate that aboveground biomass recovery of Malagasy forests appears to be slower than other tropical forests. We suggest four key synergistic factors that inhibit restoration in Madagascar: (a) lack of resilience to shifting nutrient and fire regimes arising from widespread high-intensity shifting cultivation; (b) predominance of nutrient-poor, highly weathered ferralitic soils; (c) vulnerability of regenerating native trees to competition with invasive species due to their evolutionary isolation; and (d) low seed dispersal into regenerating forests due to the unique dependence of Malagasy trees on dispersal by forest-dependent endangered or extinct primates. However, we note that rigorous experimental study of regenerating forests in Madagascar is currently lacking. There are great opportunity and need for such research to disentangle drivers and interactions inhibiting forest restoration. These studies would enable reforestation practitioners to effectively capitalize on current global momentum to implement the large-scale restoration necessary for the conservation of Madagascar's numerous endemic species.

AB  - Litter decomposition plays a key role in the cycling and storage of nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. However, very little is known about decomposition processes and their underlying drivers in tropical dry forests, particularly in human-modified landscapes. Here, we evaluate decomposition rates and nutrient concentrations and stocks in the litter of a Caatinga dry forest chronosequence, in northeast Brazil. Litter decomposition was monitored for a year across forest stands of varying ages and old-growth forests. The litter decomposition rate was highly variable across forest stands, although on average decomposition occurred slowly, with approximately 50% of the initial litter mass still present after one year. The decomposition rate is responsive to forest type and negatively affected by chronic disturbance. Litter nutrient concentration decreased along the decomposition process, exhibiting a nutrient-specific mineralization rate. Response to drivers was also nutrient specific, with precipitation and chronic disturbances playing prominent roles. Nutrient stocks in the remaining litter were higher in old-growth forests, and final stocks of certain nutrients also responded to multiple drivers. Our results suggest that the Caatinga dry forest experiences a slow rate of litter decomposition and mineralization, although rates exhibit considerable variability across forest stands and environmental conditions. Thus, chronic disturbance plays a role by either facilitating or reducing litter decomposition, mineralization rate, and the stocks transferred to the soil. Consequently, these factors have implications for nutrient availability, including goat consumption and subsequent loss of nutrients.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Jurasaidae are small neotenic beetles which were only recently discovered in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. They have a limited dispersal propensity due to their larviform wingless females. Only adult males are capable of flight. So far, only three species classified in two genera are known. Here, we report the discovery of two new species together with a morphologically and geographically interesting population of one already described species. Our discovery is important not only for understanding the diversity of the group but also from a biogeographic point of view. For the first time, we report here the discovery of a jurasaid species from the relatively dry transitional zone between the Atlantic Forest and the Caatinga biomes. Considering our recent findings as well as the minute body size and cryptic lifestyle of Jurasaidae, we expect many more species will be discovered in the future from the Atlantic Forest and possibly also other surrounding ecoregions. Our study should motivate colleagues not only to perform field research in the eastern part of South America but also to pay special attention to yet undetermined materials deposited in local institutions, laboratories and collections.
   Jurasaidae are a family of neotenic elateroid beetles which was described recently from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot based on three species in two genera. All life stages live in the soil, including the larviform females, and only adult males are able to fly. Here, we report the discovery of two new species, Jurasai miraculum sp. nov. and J. vanini sp. nov., and a new, morphologically remarkable population of J. digitusdei Rosa et al., 2020. Our discovery sheds further light on the diversity and biogeography of the group. Most species of Jurasaidae are known from the rainforest remnants of the Atlantic Forest, but here for the first time we report a jurasaid species from the relatively drier Atlantic Forest/Caatinga transitional zone. Considering our recent findings, minute body size and cryptic lifestyle of all jurasaids, together with potentially high numbers of yet undescribed species of this family from the Atlantic Forest and possibly also other surrounding ecoregions, we call for both field research in potentially suitable localities as well as for a detailed investigation of a massive amount of already collected but still unprocessed materials deposited in a number of Brazilian institutes, laboratories and collections.

AB  - Danae racemosa L., an endangered species, is an erect, evergreen shrub that grows in the shaded forest understory in the Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Except for limited knowledge of the sporadic occurrence of D. racemosa in unique moist locations, there is not much information about its ecological preferences and environmental requirements. This study investigated the relationship of D. racemosa presence (abundance) and occurrence with static (soil properties and elevation from sea level) and dynamic (climate, precipitation, and human disturbance) variables. Plant and soil samples from 21 locations of occurrence (sites) of D. racemosa were collected along the Caspian Sea's southern coastline. At each site of occurrence (site), three 100 m(2) (10x 10 m) plot was set up, and plant biometry and density were recorded. Soil samples were taken from depths of 0-25 cm and left to air dry in the lab. Later, dried soil samples were crust left to pass through a 2 mm mesh sieve and analyzed for different physicochemical properties. Meteorological data over the past 10 years (2009-2019) in the relevant area were obtained from Iran Meteorological Organization. Cluster analysis classified 21 sampling sites into four groups of habitats. Data were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) methods and habitats are classified based on environmental factors. Correlation analysis between environmental factors and density showed that soil texture (clay content), precipitation, and human activity are the most important factors affecting the abundance of D.racemosa. The findings of this investigation are useful in developing D. racemosa habitat protection, restoration, and management guidelines as well as necessitate urgency of awareness-raising.

AB  - Despite evidence showing that plant diversity or tree mixtures increase carbon storage in experimental grasslands or mixed forests, the effects of understorey plant communities on changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) storage in planted forests remain unclear, especially for monoculture plantations. Therefore, based on field observations in monoculture plantations on the Loess Plateau in China, we investigated the direct effects of understorey species richness (USR) and plantation age on SOC storage, and identified the indirect effects of understorey legume species richness (ULSR) and soil moisture (SM) mediated by USR. Results indicated that plantation age and USR significantly increased SOC sequestration with almost equal effects. The changes in the relationship between USR and SOC storage varied along the water availability gradient, from significantly positive (in plots with SM <= 11.14%) to insignificant (in plots with SM >11.14%). We observed that ULSR could increase SOC sequestration by promoting USR, while SM had negative and positive effects on ULSR and USR, respectively. Our findings can provide insights into plantation management in semiarid regions: Thinning mature plantations and introducing understorey legumes can increase SOC sequestration and maintain water resource sustainability.

AB  - This study analyzes the change characteristics of the vegetation's net primary productivity (NPP) and calculated the economic value of ecosystem services in the TNSFP area from 2000 to 2019 using NPP, normalized vegetation index, and precipitation data. Consequently, the following observations were derived from the study's results. First, the annual average vegetation NPP of the project area range was 4.5 gC center dot m-2 center dot a-1-581.7 gC center dot m-2 center dot a-1, and the annual average vegetation NPP was 162.1 gC center dot m-2 center dot a-1; high (low) NPP were mainly concentrated in the eastern (western) part. Second, the areas where the NPP increased (decreased) significantly (p<0.05) accounted for 42.70% (0.27%) of the entire area; the areas where it did not change significantly (p>0.05) accounted for 42.78% of the total area. Third, the total ecosystem service value of the TNSFP area was 0.27x1018 dollar/a; the economic value of soil conservation, carbon fixation and oxygen release, water conservation, and nutrient circulation was 0.23x1018 dollar/a (84.20% of the total area), 0.42x1017 dollar/a (15.61%), 0.15x1010 dollar/a (0.01%), and 0.50x1015 dollar/a (0.19%), respectively. Lastly, human activities and increased precipitation are the dominant factors causing vegetation restoration. Essentially, the study's findings provide theoretical and practical references for the healthy and sustainable development of the ecological environment in the Three-North Shelterbelt Area.

AB  - The study evaluated India's bioclimatic, topographical, and ecological parameters for identifying the landscape potentiality for the restoration of afforestation strategies in Tree Outside Forest (TOF). Potentially suitable spatial factors such as decadal annual soil moisture, annual climate (precipitation, temperature, and aridity index), topography (slope), ecology (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), soil fertility (nutrient availability, nutrient retention capacity, rooting conditions, oxygen availability to roots, excess salts, and toxicity) and Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) types were identified and brought into Geographical Information System (GIS) for integration based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) statistical methods. The analysis revealed that approximately 133 million hectares of the TOF landscape have a greater than 60% potential for restoration of afforestation goals for landscape conservation, biodiversity, and ecosystem services and will serve more or less 15 out of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) linked to the betterment of society, economy, and environment. There is a need for 50 billion tree targets in India that will act as a sink for approximately 0.85 billion tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually and many of them can be grown in a potentially suitable TOF landscape. This study is important for policymakers because it will serve as an outstanding synergic future strategy with long-term goals for tree expansion in the TOF of India.

AB  - Archived water quality data collected between 1901 and 2019 were used to reconstruct annual averages of various forms of C, N, P, and silicate concentrations and alkalinity in the lower Mississippi River. During this interval the average annual nitrate concentrations doubled pre-dominantly from fertilizer applications and tiling, silicate concentrations decreased by half as diatom sedimentation increased as dams were built, and alkalinity increased 16%. Variances in silicate concentrations were proportional to river discharge before 1980 and concentrations have been stable since then. Average annual temperatures, discharge and alkalinity increased simultaneously around 1980; this suggests that there was greater weathering thereafter and is supported by the positive relationships between variations in alkalinity and variations in nitrate, phosphate, and silicate concentrations. The conversion of forests and grasslands into farmlands and improved drainage resulted in less evapotranspiration, a higher percent of precipitation going into streams and altered soil water bio-geo-chemistries. Field trials demonstrating soil health improvements resulting from more live roots and soil cover and greater biodiversity demonstrate water quality improvements and no effect on farm profitability. Lowering nitrate loading to the coastal waters will reduce summertime hypoxic waters formation offshore, but alkalinity in the river will increase further with climate warming.

AB  - With economic and social globalization, invasive alien species have significantly threatened local ecological security. Identifying the invasive mechanisms of invasive alien species can aid in preventing species invasions and protecting local ecological and economic security. As a globally invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora (Asteraceae) has spread to many parts of the world and had a seriously impacted the ecology and economy of its invaded areas. Using observational data and Landsat OLI images in an arid valley region in southwest China, this study examined how climate, human activity and environmental factors influence the invasion of A. adenophora and its underlying mechanism. Our results showed that the invasion abundance of A. adenophora was significantly affected by environmental factors (the relative importance was 87.2%), but was less influenced by human activity and climate factors (the relative importance was 2% and 10.8%, respectively). The A. adenophora abundance significantly decreased with aspect, community canopy density, shrub layer coverage, herb layer coverage, Simpson diversity index of shrub and herb layers, the shortest distance to residential areas and temperature seasonality, whereas it increased with soil moisture, temperature annual range, precipitation of wettest month and precipitation of driest month. We conclude that biotic competition is the most influential factor in the invasion of this plant in the arid valley regions. Our results are of great significance for invasion prevention and forest conservation and management in southwest China. Our work emphasized that optimizing the community structure, such as by increasing canopy and shrub coverage and species biodiversity, may help control and mitigate the A. adenophora invasion in southwest China.

AB  - Terrestrial vegetation is a substantial carbon sink and plays a foundational role in regional and global climate change mitigation strategies. The state of California, USA, commits to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 in part by managing terrestrial ecosystems to sequester more than 80 MMT of CO2. We used a 35-year net primary productivity (NPP) remote sensing product with gridded climate, soil, topography, and vegetation data to evaluate spatiotemporal drivers of NPP variation and identify drivers of NPP response to extremes in water availability in California's major grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands. We used generalized boosted models (GBMs) and linear mixed effects models (LMMs) to identify influential predictors of NPP and characterize their relationships with NPP across seven major vegetation cover types: annual grasslands, blue oak, chamise-redshank chaparral, coastal scrub, coastal oak woodland, mixed chaparral, and montane hardwood. Climate seasonality, specifically greater precipitation and warmer minimum temperatures in early spring and winter, was associated with greater NPP across space, particularly in chaparral, blue oak, and grassland systems. Maximum annual temperature and climatic water deficit (CWD) showed a negative relationship with NPP in most vegetation cover types, particularly chaparral and coastal scrub. We found a significant decrease in NPP over time in most vegetation types, appearing to coincide with the 2012-2016 California mega-drought. However, response to water availability extremes differed by vegetation type. In most vegetation types, especially grasslands, increases in NPP in extreme wet years were greater than declines in NPP in dry years. Our analysis characterizes several climate risks and conservation opportunities in using California's natural lands to store carbon. Namely, shifts in climate seasonality and water availability extremes threaten these systems' ability to fix carbon, yet hotspots of NPP resilience may exist and could be enhanced through conservation and restoration. Additional mechanistic work can help illuminate these opportunities and prioritize conservation decision making.

AB  - Orobanche laxissima (Orobanchaceae) is a polyphagous holoparasite of the roots of 14 species of trees and shrubs in the Caucasus (the region on the border of Europe and Asia). This parasite is expansive but in a limited geographic area and it was reported to occur in natural or seminatural forest and shrub habitats, and recently also in horticulture and arboriculture. In this study, the ecological niche modeling (ENM) approach was used to estimate the possible effects of climate change on the niche of O. laxissima and evaluate the effect of its parasitic relationships with 10 trees and shrubs and the chances of survival of this species of forest habitats. Moreover, the model for the Last Glacial Maximum was created to evaluate the general pattern of the distribution of studied species niches. Many of the hosts of this parasite are trees that are the dominant component of the most important forests in the Caucasus. Climate change may affect holoparasites both directly through effects on its physiology and indirectly as a consequence of its effects on their host plants and forest communities. The glacial range of O. laxissima was 82% smaller than currently recorded. Its occurrence is related mostly to precipitation in the driest month (bio 14) as this species requires a substantial amount of rain even in the dry season. According to our models, O. laxissima is likely to increase its current geographical range from 30% to 52%, as a response to global warming, especially in areas in the Caucasus, in the Black Sea Region in southern parts of the Crimean Peninsula in Russia, and northern Turkey. Only the most extreme SSP5-8.5 scenario will be damaging for this species, with a 21-35% range contraction. Monitoring parasite populations is a very important part management, and in our case, it can also be useful for predicting the effects of climate change on trees and, in many cases, unique refugial deciduous forest communities, such as the Colchic rainforests.

AB  - Climate change has been modifying precipitation and temperature in many regions of the world, prompting changes in plant communities. It also affects soil microbial communities, indirectly influencing plant species distribution through plant-soil feedbacks. Here we report an experiment designed to test seed germination responses to global change, addressed through the interaction between increased temperature and soil microbial communities in a tree species in the Atlantic rainforest, a global biodiversity hotspot. Our objective was to test plant-soil feedbacks in an early colonizer tree species, Schizolobium parahyba, and their interaction with warming. We assessed the role of increased air temperature and soil microbiota in controlling seed germination as a function of distance to mother tree. Higher germination percentages were recorded with extracts of soil microbial communities from the edge of the canopy than with microbial extracts obtained closer to the trunk. These manipulations evidenced that soil microbiota influenced seed germination, being responsible for Janzen-Connell effects. Warming produced major changes in microbial composition but the effect on germination was unclear. Our results may help understand species distribution and coexistence in secondary patches of Atlantic rainforest under warmer conditions, and may contribute to the design of successful restoration programs.

AB  - Knowledge is lacking on the factors controlling the structure and spatial distribution of earthworm communities within agroecosystems. We first hypothesized that forested riparian buffer strips (FRBS) within agricultural landscapes would be a refuge for earthworms, as we predicted higher soil moisture and organic matter inputs in FRBS than in adjacent agricultural fields (treatments = FRBS vs. Field). We further hypothesized that earthworms would be most abundant where the chemical quality of above- and belowground plant litter is high, or where soil disturbance is low. We conducted a field survey to quantify earthworm species abundances in FRBS and adjacent agricultural fields in two bioregions, namely Eastern Canada and Central Europe. At each of 77 sites, we collected and identified earthworms from three plots within FRBS and within adjacent agricultural fields. In each plot, we identified the tree species, understory vegetation, soil drainage class, agricultural crop as well as five soil physicochemical properties. In each bioregion and treatment, we found proportionately more endogeic than anecic or epigeic earthworm species. In Eastern Canada, there were proportionately fewer anecic and more epigeic individuals in FRBS than in fields; in Central Europe there were fewer endogeic and more anecic earthworms in FRBS than in fields. We found significant bioregion x treatment interactions on earthworm abundance and soil moisture. More specifically, in Eastern Canada we found higher earthworm abundance and soil moisture in FRBS, whereas in Central Europe we found higher earthworm abundance in fields and no treatment effect on soil moisture. In both bioregions, we found higher organic matter in FRBS than in fields. In Eastern Canada, earthworm abundance in deciduous and mixedwood stands were higher than in coniferous stands; in Central Europe, earthworm abundance was highest in deciduous stands only. Within FRBS in Eastern Canada, the abundance of the prominent endogeic species, Apporectodea rosea, was correlated with herbaceous plants, notably ferns and graminoids. Conditional regression tree analysis revealed positive relationships between earthworms and soil clay content, pH, moisture and organic matter. Our results suggest that local and landscape patterns in earthworm diversity can be predicted by soil and vegetation attributes, however the relative importance of these factors changes across continental scales due to differences in precipitation patterns and soil moisture availability. Comparing the distributions of earthworms across different scales provides insights into the potential of different species to spread into new habitats with climate change.

AB  - Since the 1960s, the increased availability of modern seed varieties in developing countries has had large positive effects on households' well-being. However, the effect of related land use changes on deforestation and biodiversity is ambiguous. This study examines this question through a randomized control trial in a remote area in the Congo Basin rainforest with weak input and output markets. Using plot-level data on land conversion combined with remote sensing data, we find that promotion of modern seed varieties did not lead to an increase in overall deforestation by small farmers. However, farmers cleared more primary forest and less secondary forest. We attribute this to the increased demand for nitrogen required by the use of some modern seed varieties, and to the lack of alternative sources of soil nutrients, which induced farmers to shift towards cultivation of land cleared in primary forest. Unless combined with interventions to maintain soil fertility, policies to promote modern seed varieties may come at the cost of important losses in biodiversity.
   Availability of modern seed varieties in developing countries has had positive effects on households' well-being. Here, the authors show that without support to maintain soil fertility, access to modern seed varieties increases primary forest clearance in DR Congo.

AB  - Ferns (Polypodiophyta) are an abundant floral element of the tropics with high sensitivity to environmental conditions and good indicators of overall biodiversity. Here, we set out to identify which geochemical factors determine fern diversity in a low-montane tropical rainforest in Eastern Ecuador. We conducted a field survey of high-spatial resolution completing a comprehensive fern inventory across two elevational ranges, combined with biochemical characterisation of the underlying soils. While a-diversity was negatively correlated with cation exchange capacity (CEC) and with elevation, beta-diversity increased with elevation and with geographic distance, as predicted. Our results confirm that ferns have a high sensitivity to both elevational and environmental gradients, where the latter in this study was derived from enhanced aluminium, iron and calcium contents in some of the studied soils. Further monitoring of fern communities could therefore help to better understand and predict how environmental change may impact biodiversity, with a particular focus on threats potentially arising from toxic elements being released in tropical soils through modified soil CEC.

AB  - The Indian State of Odisha has been the hotspot for extreme weather conditions such as heat waves, cyclones, severe droughts, floods, and extreme cyclones, throughout history. The state is witnessing natural calamities at an alarming frequency challenging sustenance of all sorts. There have been cases of 30 cyclones hitting the state in the last 11 years. Even though the coastline of Odisha constitutes 17% of the eastern coastline of India, it has witnessed damage and destruction of almost 35% of all cyclonic storms which crossed the eastern coast of the Indian subcontinent. Coastal Orrisa has been the battleground for survival from dreadful cyclones in all these cases. Wherever the cyclones make landfall there is a substantive alteration in the dynamics of landscape and wildlife. On the third and fourth of May 2019 cyclone 'Fani' made landfall in Odisha's coastal forest areas comprising Balukhand wildlife sanctuary and caused catastrophic destruction to its landscape and wildlife resources within only a few hours. The sanctuary previously considered to be an important physiological barrier to the nearby agrarian community because of its dense plantation for controlling soil erosion, turned into a barren land with most of the trees severely damaged. Many studies and strategies have been developed to safeguard the interests of man and society during such extreme weather events. However, the formulation of proper strategies for the conservation of biodiversity and wildlife, which could have prevented loss and extreme damage to ecology considerably, has not been done so far. The objectives of this paper are to (1) study the pattern of damage to the existing vegetation, (2) analyze the destruction of wildlife and vegetation, and (3) propose biodiversity management and mitigation measures and increase preparedness for such cyclones in the coming future.

AB  - 1. Despite important progress in understanding the impacts of forest clearing and logging on above-ground communities, how these disturbances affect soil microbial beta-diversity and the ecological processes driving microbial assemblages are poorly understood. Furthermore, whether and how the microbial shifts affect vegetation composition and diversity during recovery of post-logged forests remain elusive.
   2. Using a spatial grid experiment design in a primary tropical forest intermixed with post-logged patches naturally recovered for half century in Hainan Island, China, we characterized and explained the distance-decay relationships of soil microbial similarities in primary, selectively logged and clear-cut forests.
   3. Selectively logged sites showed a lower spatial turnover rate of bacterial assemblages based on phylogenetic and taxonomic beta-diversity, but a higher spatial turnover rate of fungal assemblages based on phylogenetic beta-diversity, suggesting a higher level of phylogenetic variability in fungal composition. Clear-cut sites showed lower spatial turnover for both bacterial and fungal assemblages based on the two beta-diversity, indicating community homogenization. Main drivers of microbial assemblages shifted from soil properties in primary forest to tree composition in selectively logged sites, whereas microbial-tree associations declined in clear-cut sites, leading to stochastically organized microbial assemblages.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The increased fungal phylogenetic turnover with tree turnover following selective logging promotes unassisted recovery of plant diversity. In contrast, the decoupling of tree and microbial turnover following clear-cutting suggests restoration approaches based on tree planting, and tree species that have strong associations with bulk soil microbial community should be considered. Our findings advance the understanding of spatial patterns, processes and drivers of soil microbial assemblages in parallel with tree community recovery during regeneration of post-logged tropical forests, and highlight the importance of coupling assemblage patterns between tree and soil fungal communities for conserving tropical forest biodiversity.

AB  - Understanding the assembly of soil microbial communities of tropical forest is of great significance for the protection of biodiversity in tropical areas. Many studies have been carried out on biodiversity and its main-tenance mechanism in tropical regions. However, the effects of land use and seasonal variation on the assembly of soil fungal and bacterial communities in tropical forests remains unknown. To fill this research gap, 16S rRNA and ITS sequences were used to evaluate the assembly mechanisms of soil bacterial and fungal communities using 260 soil samples collected from tropical rainforest and rubber plantation sites across Hainan Island, South China. A majority (similar to 60%) of observed OTUs conformed with neutral model expectations, indicating that neutral processes were important for the assembly of soil microbial communities. For bacterial communities, the NST (normalized stochasticity ratio) was higher in the tropical rainforest (0.746 in the dry season, 0.684 in the rainy season) versus rubber plantation sites (0.647, 0.584), regardless of season. This indicated rainforest were more stochastic than rubber plantation for soil bacterial community assembly. For fungal communities, rubber plan-tation communities showed greater stochasticity (NST = 0.578) than rainforest communities (NST = 0.388) in the dry season, but the reverse was true in the rainy season (NST = 0.852 for rubber plantations; NST = 0.978 for rainforest). Both the NST results and structural equation modeling showed that bacterial communities were more stochastic in the dry season, while fungal communities were more stochastic in the rainy season; the effects of seasonal changes on assembly therefore differed between bacterial and fungal communities. More importantly, forest types did not have a direct impact on the assembly of bacterial or fungal communities, but exerted indirect effects via soil pH and soil available potassium.

AB  - Forests are generally extracted from remotely sensed images based on the spectral features, ignoring other important auxiliary information, and the techniques of precise extraction need to be further improved. By using the Sentinel-2 image and auxiliary factors (AFs) including site conditions (SCs) and vegetation indices (VIs), the random forest model with AFs (RF-AFs) was adopted for the extraction of the economic forests in Lancang County, which is a mountainous area with rich biodiversity and is witnessing rapid development of economic forests in Yunnan province of China. The results obtained using the RF-AFs model were compared with those obtained using the random forest model without AFs (RF). The results were as follows: (1) The kappa coefficient for extracting the first-level land use obtained using the RF model was 0.9531. Lancang County is dominated by forests, accounting for 73.76% of the total area. (2) After parameter optimization, the RF-AFs model yielded the highest accuracy in the extraction of the second-level forests, with a kappa coefficient value of 0.9493, which was 14.69% higher than that of the RF model. Thus, the RF-AFs model is more suitable for the precise extraction of economic forests. (3) The evaluation results of the factors' importance of the RF-AFs model showed that the cumulative importance values of SCs such as temperature (TEM), elevation (EL), precipitation (PRE) and VIs such as plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI) was 76.09%, indicating that they were the main factors for the extraction of economic forests. (4) Economic forests are dominated by Simao pines in Lancang County, which are mainly distributed in the central, southwestern and northern regions, accounting for 31.37% of forests area. The proportion of tea plantations, eucalyptus, and rubber trees is 9.05%, 6.71%, and 3.05% of forests area, respectively. The RF-AFs model is conducive for precisely extracting the economic forests and is thus of great significance in studying the ecological and environmental effects of economic forests, performing forestry management, and maintaining regional ecological security.

AB  - Soil biota generates carbon that exports vertically to the atmosphere (CO2) and transports laterally to streams and rivers (dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, DOC and DIC). These processes, together with chemical weathering, vary with flow paths across hydrological regimes; yet an integrated understanding of these interactive processes is still lacking. Here we ask: How and to what extent do subsurface carbon transformation, chemical weathering, and solute export differ across hydrological and subsurface structure regimes? We address this question using a hillslope reactive transport model calibrated using soil CO2 and water chemistry data from Fitch, a temperate forest at the ecotone boundary of the Eastern temperate forest and mid-continent grasslands in Kansas, USA. Model results show that droughts (discharge at 0.08 mm/day) promoted deeper flow paths, longer water transit time, carbonate precipitation, and mineralization of organic carbon (OC) into inorganic carbon (IC) (similar to 98% of OC). Of the IC produced, similar to 86% was emitted upward as CO2 gas and similar to 14% was exported laterally as DIC into the stream. Storms (8.0 mm/day) led to carbonate dissolution but reduced OC mineralization (similar to 88% of OC) and promoted DOC production (similar to 12% of OC) and lateral fluxes of IC (similar to 53% of produced IC). Differences in shallow-versus-deep permeability contrasts led to smaller difference (<10%) than discharge-induced differences and were most pronounced under wet conditions. High permeability contrasts (low vertical connectivity) enhanced lateral fluxes. Model results generally delineate hillslopes as active CO2 producers and vertical carbon transporters under dry conditions, and as active DOC producers and lateral carbon transporter under wet conditions.

AB  - Assessment of spatiotemporal dynamics of meteorological variables and their forecast is essential in the context of climate change. Such analysis can help suggest possible solutions for flora and fauna in protected areas and adaptation strategies to make forests and communities more resilient. The present study attempts to analyze climate variability, trend and forecast of temperature and rainfall in the Valmiki Tiger Reserve, India. We utilized rainfall and temperature gridded data obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department during 1981-2020. The Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope estimator were employed to examine the time series trend and magnitude of change at the annual, monthly and seasonal levels. Random forest machine learning algorithm was used to estimate seasonal prediction and forecasting of rainfall and temperature trend for the next ten years (2021-2030). The predictive capacity of the model was evaluated by statistical performance assessors of coefficient of correlation, mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error and root mean squared error. The findings revealed a significant decreasing trend in rainfall and an increasing trend in temperature. However, a declining trend for maximum temperature has been observed for winter and post-monsoon seasons. The results of seasonal forecasting exhibited a considerable decrease in rainfall and temperature across the Reserve during all the seasons. However, the temperature will increase during the summer season. The random forest machine learning algorithm has shown its effectiveness in forecasting the temperature and rainfall variables. The findings suggest that these approaches may be used at various spatial scales in different geographical locations.

AB  - Exploring vegetation distribution spatial patterns facilitates understanding how biodiversity addresses the potential threat of future climate variability, especially for highly diverse and threatened tropical plant communities, but few empirical studies have been performed. Dacrydium pectinatum is a constructive and endangered species in the tropical mountain forests of Hainan Island, China. In this study, sixty-eight 30 m x 30 m permanent plots of D. pectinatum were investigated, and species-based and phylogenetic-based methods were used to analyze the alpha- and beta-diversity pattern variation and its key drivers. Our study showed that species and phylogenetic alpha-diversity patterns are different on a local scale. However, on a regional scale, the variations in the two alpha-diversity patterns tend to converge, and they decrease with increasing elevation. The phylogenetic structure changes from overdispersion to convergence with increasing elevation. Soil (SOM, TP, AP), topography (EL, SL), and stand (CD) factors and alpha-diversity showed close correlations. Species and phylogenetic beta-diversity have significant positive correlations with changing environmental distance and geographical distance; however, as a representative form of habitat heterogeneity, elevation distance has a greater impact on beta-diversity changes than geographical distance. In conclusion, the alpha- and beta-diversity patterns of the D. pectinatum community are mainly related to habitat filtering, especially in high-elevation areas, and the colonization history of various regions also affects the formation of diversity patterns. Species-based and phylogenetic-based methods robustly demonstrated the key role of the habitat filtering hypothesis in community assembly. We believe that more plant diversity patterns need to be explored to understand the biodiversity formation mechanisms in tropical forests. We also recommend strengthening the construction and management of nature reserves to help address the biodiversity loss crisis in endangered tropical plant communities.

AB  - Species richness in tropical forests is correlated with other dimensions of diversity, including the diversity of plant-herbivore interactions and the phytochemical diversity that influences those interactions. Understanding the complexity of plant chemistry and the importance of phytochemical diversity for plant-insect interactions and overall forest richness has been enhanced significantly by the application of metabolomics to natural systems. The present work used proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-NMR) profiling of crude leaf extracts to study phytochemical similarity and diversity among Piper plants growing naturally in the Atlantic Rainforest of Brazil. Spectral profile similarity and chemical diversity were quantified to examine the relationship between metrics of phytochemical diversity, specialist and generalist herbivory, and understory plant richness. Herbivory increased with understory species richness, while generalist herbivory increased and specialist herbivory decreased with the diversity of Piper leaf material available. Specialist herbivory increased when conspecific host plants were more spectroscopically dissimilar. Spectral similarity was lower among individuals of common species, and they were also more spectrally diverse, indicating phytochemical diversity is beneficial to plants. Canopy openness and soil nutrients also influenced chemistry and herbivory. The complex relationships uncovered in this study add information to our growing understanding of the importance of phytochemical diversity for plant-insect interactions and tropical plant species richness.

AB  - It has been found that climatic conditions affect the biological properties of soils on which their fertility and sustainability depends. Most studies on the impact of climate change on soil properties are based on the results of model experiments, which focus on changes in one, rarely two factors. In these experiments the direct influence of climatic factors on soil properties is traced, but in natural conditions the climate has not only direct influence, but also indirect, influencing other factors. Therefore, it is very important to study the response of soils to climate change in the geographical aspect. This knowledge will allow us to make more accurate predictions of soil fertility, sustainability, quality and health under possible climate change. Two transects crossing the North Caucasus in latitudinal and meridian directions have been investigated. The first transect is latitudinal one, its general direction is from west to east, it is 800 km long, passes through plains, dry plains and semi-deserts and reflects the increasing continentality of the climate from west to east. The second transect is meridional, which is 1000 km long, crosses the plains, forest-steppe, deciduous and coniferous forests as well as mountain meadows in a north-south direction. It reflects climate changes during the transition from plain natural zones to the mountainous zones of the Caucasus Mountains. The patterns of dependence of biological properties were revealed for Chernozems, Kastanozems, Calcisols, Phaeozem, Cambisols, Leptosols zonal soils of the North Caucasus: the number of fungi and bacteria, activity of catalase (CA), dehydrogenase (DH), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (PO) and invertase (IN), soil organic carbon (SOC) content versus climatic parameters (temperature, precipitation, climatic indices and coefficients). The factors limiting biota and biological activity of soils have been identified. The maximum dependence of their biological parameters is typical for extreme climatic conditions. The highest correlation of biological parameters of soils was noted with the annual precipitation and temperature amplitude. The maximum values of the total biological activity, taking into account the entire soil profile, were noted in warm and sufficiently humid climatic conditions, where deep Haplic Chernozem Pachic are formed. When the moisture conditions change, both towards aridization and humidization, the total biological activity of soils decreases, which is calculated for the entire thickness of the soil to the rock. SOC is an accumulative indicator of biological activity, therefore it most closely correlates with most of the studied climatic indicators. Among soil enzymes, a close dependence on climatic parameters was established for CA. IN, DH, PPO and PO have more complex non-linear relationships with climatic conditions.

AB  - Ecosystem service values (ESVs) are crucial to ecological conservation and restoration, urban and rural planning, and sustainable development of land. Therefore, it is important to study ESVs and their driving factors in the Dongting Lake Eco-Economic Zone (Dongting Lake). This paper quantifies the changes in ESVs in the Dongting Lake using land use data from 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2018. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is used to study the effects of individual driving factors and the synergistic effects of these driving factors on ESVs. Our analysis suggests that: (1) From 2000 to 2018, the largest dynamic degree values in the Dongting Lake are in unused land types, followed by construction lands and wetlands. The ESVs of the Dongting Lake show an increasing trend, with those of forestlands being the highest, accounting for approximately 44.65% of the total value. Among the ESVs functions, water containment, waste treatment, soil formation and protection, biodiversity conservation and climate regulation contribute the most to ESVs, with a combined contribution of 76.64% to 76.99%; (2) The integrated intensity of anthropogenic disturbance shows a U-shaped spatial distribution, decreasing from U1 to U3. The driving factors in descending order of importance are the human impact index, total primary productivity (GPP), slope, elevation, population, temperature, gross domestic product, precipitation and PM2.5; (3) When the GPP is low (GPP < 900), the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanation) value of the high human impact index is greater than zero, indicating that an increase in GPP increases the ESVs in the Dongting Lake. This study can provide technical support and a theoretical basis for ecological environmental protection and ecosystem management in the Dongting Lake.

AB  - Regionalization through the analysis of species groups offers important advantages in conservation biology, compared to the single taxon approach in areas of high species richness. We use a systematic framework for biogeographic regionalization at a regional scale based on species turnover and environmental drivers (climate variables and soil properties) mainly of herbaceous plant species richness. To identify phytogeographic regions in the Balsas Depression (BD), we use Asteraceae species, a family widely distributed in Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) and the most diverse of the vascular plants in Mexico. Occurrence records of 571 species were used to apply a quantitative analysis based on the species turnover, the rate of changes in their composition between sites (beta -Simpson index) and the analysis of the identified environmental drivers. Also, the environmental predictors that influence species richness in the SDTF were determined with a redundancy analysis. We identified and named two phytogeographic districts within the SDTF of the BD (Upper Balsas and Lower Balsas). According to the multi-response permutation procedure, floristic composition of the two districts differs significantly, and the richness of exclusive species in Upper Balsas was higher (292 species) than in the Lower Balsas (32 species). The proportion of Mg and Ca in the soil and the precipitation of the driest three-month period were the environmental factors with greatest positive influence on species richness. The division of geographic districts subordinated to the province level, based on diverse families such as Asteraceae, proved to be appropriate to set up strategies for the conservation of the regional flora, since at this scale, variation in species richness is more evident. Our findings are consistent with a growing body of biogeographic literature that indicates that the identification of smaller biotic districts is more efficient for the conservation of biodiversity, particularly of endemic or rare plants, whose distribution responds more to microhabitats variation.

AB  - Water conservation areas play an important role in regional ecological security patterns. The Funiu Mountain water conservation area is located in the densely populated central region of China, where human disturbance to the ecosystem is strong and ecosystem services are facing a very serious situation. Identifying and evaluating the factors leading to changes in the ecosystem service value (ESV) of the Funiu Mountain water conservation area can provide scientific guidance for ecological management and sustainable development. Using multi-source data and machine learning methods, our research reveals the characteristics of the spatio-temporal variation in the ESV, constructs a system of ESV influencing factors from the comprehensive perspectives of the natural environment and human activities, and discusses the comprehensive effects of the influencing factors on the Funiu Mountain area from 2000 to 2015. The results are as follows. (1) From 2000 to 2005, the ESV increased 375 million yuan, and from 2005 to 2015, it decreased 154 million yuan. (2) Hydrological regulation, biodiversity maintenance, soil conservation, gas regulation, and climate regulation were the main types of ecosystem services in the Funiu Mountain area. (3) The ESV was influenced by the comprehensive effects of the natural environment and human activities. Population was the most important influencing factor of the ESV; in addition, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), precipitation, and economic factors had important influences on the ESV. (4) With the intensification of human activities, humanistic factors have surpassed the relatively stable natural factors, becoming the main factors of the ESV. With economic development, the effect of human activities on the ESV may be further intensified in the future.

AB  - Traits determine species response to climate conditions and the match between phenotypes and climate mediates spatial variation in species composition. These trait-climate linkages can be disrupted in human-modified landscapes. Human land use creates forest fragments where dispersal limitation or edge effects exclude species that may otherwise suit a given macroclimate. Furthermore, stressful macroclimate can limit viable trait combinations such that only a subset of values of any given trait occurs with respect to another trait, resulting in stronger trait covariance. Because forest loss can compound climatic stress, trait covariance from benign to harsher climates is expected to be stronger in fragments compared to contiguous forests. In a wet tropical forest landscape in the Western Ghats Biodiversity Hotspot of peninsular India, I compared fragments with adjacent contiguous forests for signatures of trait-mediated assembly of tree communities. Using four key plant traits-seed size, specific leaf area (SLA), wood density, and maximum height-I evaluated trait-abundance associations and trait covariance across climate, soil, and elevation gradients. In the contiguous forest, smaller-seeded, shorter, thinner-leaved species became more abundant from low to high elevations. In fragments, species with higher SLA were more abundant at sites with more seasonal climates and lower precipitation, and larger seeded species were less abundant at warmer sites. However, traits only weakly predicted abundances in both habitats. Moreover, only contiguous forests exhibited significant compositional change via traits, driven by trait syndromes varying along a composite gradient defined by elevation, water deficit, and soil C:N ratio. Site-level trait covariance revealed that warmer, wetter conditions in fragments favored taller species for given seed size, as compared to similar conditions in contiguous forests. Overall, trait syndromes and trait covariance, rather than single traits, determined the phenotypes best suited to macroclimate conditions and should inform management or restoration goals in fragments.

AB  - We reviewed recent literature to identify the positive and negative effects of thinning on both stand- and tree-level resistance and resilience to four stressors that are expected to increase in frequency and/or severity due to global change: (1) drought, (2) fire, (3) insects and pathogens, and (4) wind. There is strong evidence that thinning, particularly heavy thinning, reduces the impact of drought and also the risk and severity of fire when harvest slash is burned or removed. Thinning also increases the growth and vigor of residual trees, making them less susceptible to eruptive insects and pathogens, while targeted removal of host species, susceptible individuals and infected trees can slow the spread of outbreaks. However, the evidence that thinning has consistent positive effects is limited to a few insects and pathogens, and negative effects on root rot infection severity were also reported. At this point, our review reveals insufficient evidence from rigorous experiments to draw general conclusions. Although thinning initially increases the risk of windthrow, there is good evidence that thinning young stands reduces the long-term risk by promoting the development of structural roots and favouring the acclimation of trees to high wind loads. While our review suggests that thinning should not be promoted as a tool that will universally increase the resistance and resilience of forests, current evidence suggests that thinning could still be an effective tool to reduce forest vulnerability to several stressors, creating a window of opportunity to implement longer term adaptive management strategies such as assisted migration. We highlight knowledge gaps that should be targeted by future research to assess the potential contribution of thinning to adaptive forest management. One of these gaps is that studies from boreal and tropical regions are drastically underrepresented, with almost no studies conducted in Asia and the southern hemisphere. Empirical evidence from these regions is urgently needed to allow broader-scale conclusions.

AB  - The South China Karst (SCK), the world's largest contiguous karst region, has undergone severe ecological degradation associated with the interaction of fragile natural attributes and human activities. Understanding the causes of changes in ecosystem services (ES) is essential to prevent and control ecosystem degradation and support sustainable development. However, existing studies have not comprehensively explored the impact of natural systems and human activities on karst ES and have failed to consider their spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Here, we used regression analysis to study the spatiotemporal evolution of ES in diverse landscapes (karst and non-karst) of SCK and the impact of human activity on them. Random forest regression and geographically weighted regression analysis were used to explore the key factors and driving forces in different landscape ES. The results show that from 1982 to 2018, ES, such as soil conservation (+8.12%), net primary productivity (+21.14%), carbon storage (+0.86%), nitrogen export (-5.89%), and phosphorus export (-1.46%), were improved, mainly due to re-greening and rewilding, which optimizes the structure of the ecosystem. However, large-scale afforestation led to a decrease in water yield (-13.23%). Urban development worsened habitat quality (-0.50%) and biodiversity (-1.91%). With the intensification of human activities, ES in the karst region showed lower maintenance capacity than in non-karst regions. The study found that the driving factors of ES varied with the differing landscapes. Population distribution in the karst region was the biggest threat to ES, whereas farming in the non-karst region was the main ES threat in this region. In these regions, the improvement in vegetation coverage was helpful in plant-carbon sequestration, and the increase of precipitation increased water yield. Importantly, we found that biodiversity maintenance plays a crucial role in ES. Nature-based solutions combined with proper management strategies can counter ecosystem degradation and help achieve sustainable development.

AB  - Outbreaks of defoliating insects in low-diversity tropical forests occur infrequently but provide valuable insights about outbreak ecology in temperate environments and in general. We investigated an extensive outbreak of the endemic koa moth (Scotorythra paludicola), which defoliated endemic koa trees (Acacia koa) over a third of their range on Hawai'i Island during 2013 and 2014. At Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge, we observed the dynamics of the outbreak and its effects on host trees, nutrient cycling, and insectivorous consumers in reforestation stands of densely planted koa and in natural forest stands of mixed koa and 'ohi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha). Contrary to predictions of the resource concentration hypothesis, caterpillar biomass and defoliation severity were greater in the natural forest sites, where koa density was relatively low. Caterpillars preferentially consumed the most palatable koa foliage type (phyllodes), and koa initially refoliated with the least palatable foliage type (true leaves). Lightly defoliated small trees refoliated more quickly than did heavily defoliated ones but the opposite was true for large trees, which also produced a greater proportion of phyllodes. Mortality was greatest for heavily defoliated small koa. Caterpillar frass caused larger increases in soil nitrogen (N) than phosphorus (P) availability, with the greatest N increases in fine-textured soils. Foliar N increased in alien grasses under koa canopies compared to grasses away from koa and to native woody understory species. Bird activity was influenced by 'ohi'a flower abundance and the severity of koa defoliation; birds switched to outbreaking caterpillar prey, and they gained weight during the outbreak. Bat foraging times decreased during the outbreak, apparently because they became satiated quickly each night. Parasitoid wasps increased with caterpillar abundance but had little influence on outbreak dynamics. Reducing alien grass cover and increasing tree diversity would likely reduce the impacts of insect outbreaks and similar perturbations to native forests.

AB  - Silphium perfoliatum is a perennial crop native to North America that has been the subject of increased scientific interest in recent years, especially in Europe. It is drought- and frost-resistant, which makes it suitable for cultivation in Europe on marginal lands that are not used for growing other crops. This review analyzed the distribution and purposes of the cultivation of Silphium perfoliatum worldwide, as well as its biomass yields and characteristics as a feedstock for biogas production and other purposes. A total of 121 scientific publications on Silphium perfoliatum were identified, with the highest number (20 papers) published in 2019. It was found that higher biomass yields can be obtained at higher precipitation levels, with the use of fertilizers and an adequate type of plantation. The mean dry matter yield of Silphium perfoliatum was 13.3 Mg ha(-1) DM (dry matter), and it ranged from 2 to over 32 Mg ha(-1) DM. In some countries, Silphium is used as a forage crop mainly due to its high crude protein content (from 4.9% to 15% DM), depending on the vegetation phase. Silphium perfoliatum is a promising perennial crop in terms of energy and other benefits for biodiversity, soil quality and applications in medicine and pharmacology.

AB  - Climate change is enhancing the annual mean temperature and the risk for droughts and natural disasters. Hot and dry summers not only have a negative impact on forest performance, but also affect fundamental ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and nutrient cycling and the organisms involved. Oribatid mites are sexually or parthenogenetically reproducing soil-living microarthropods substantially involved in these processes. We compare oribatid mite communities (abundance, species richness, effective Shannon diversity and life-history parameters such as sex ratio, gravidity, number of eggs) in four microhabitats (litter, dead wood, moss and bare soil) before (2016) and after a sequence of disturbance events (2020). These disturbances include the severe drought of 2018/2019 in Germany, a single summer storm event in August 2019, and subsequent forest operations in spring 2020. Abundance and species richness were reduced up to 87% in all microhabitats and so was the effective Shannon diversity in moss (65%). Communities in moss were most affected, while effects were buffered in litter. In litter and moss, sexual species suffered slightly more than parthenogenetic species. Life history parameters were largely unaffected. In bare soil, microarthropods were almost absent. Our study demonstrates that consequences of climate change - drought, windthrow, necessary forest operations - are not restricted to above-ground systems but also strongly affect soil-living microarthropod communities. If natural and human-introduced disturbances remain in the long-term, severe consequences for forest soil arthropods must be expected. Since life-history parameters were unaffected, species probably recover over time if climate becomes more moderate in the short-term.

AB  - In this paper, we use palynology and geochemical proxies to reconstruct late Quaternary vegetation changes within the hydrographic basin of Parnaiba, Northeast Brazil, over the last 130 kyrs. Findings are based on the analysis of a marine sediment core (GL-1248) retrieved from the western equatorial Atlantic (055.2 & PRIME;S, 4324.1 & PRIME;W), close to the coast. Geochemical proxies (Fe/IC ratio and sigma Nd) indicative of soil erosion match changes in reconstructed vegetation, suggesting a dynamic pattern of hydrological disturbances and ecosystem evolution. Given that reconstructed vegetation does not present the same response to precipitation anomalies on the millennial scale, we sought the main drivers of vegetation changes in the Parnaiba watershed. Results indicate that vegetation succession was primarily influenced by austral insolation from March to May, which triggered changes in the pioneer vegetation types. Our study improves the knowledge of tropical vegetation dynamics in an orbital framework, suggesting 23-kyr precessional cycles as the main driver of landscape evo-lution in Northeast (NE) Brazil. We also infer that such past climate change events may have been a key causal factor of the high biodiversity of the Neotropics, mediated through the biological exchange of the Amazon and Atlantic rainforest species via ecological forest corridors in the semi-arid Northeast Brazil.

AB  - Understanding multiple environmental drivers governing tropical organisms' distribution and ecological niches is crucial for predicting their responses to ongoing rapid deforestation. While macroclimatic effects via energy and water availability are well predicted, less is known about locally modulating factors such as canopy structure, light and edaphic conditions. Here we show that minimum temperatures and ambient humidity drive the abundance and richness of leaf-inhabiting epiphyllous bryophytes across 4-km elevation gradient on Mount Cameroon, West Africa, separating epiphyll-rich rainforests (0-2200 m a.s.l.) from epihyll-poor fire-driven afromontane savanna (2300-4000 m a.s.l.). However, local factors contribute more than half to the total abundance and richness variation, either directly (light) or indirectly (edaphic conditions) via their effects on host plant composition. The most abundant epiphyllous communities occur in vertically stratified upland rainforests between 600 and 1100 m elevation, where N-fixing tree legumes dominate. Their canopy is relatively sparse, due to nutrient-poor soils leached by high rainfall, leaving room for the development of diverse subcanopy tree and understory shrub and herb layers with epiphyll-rich communities. Vertically homogenous lowland rainforests on fertile soils below 500 m, with dense overstory and shaded and species-poor understory, have less developed epiphylls, as do seasonally dry montane forests between 2000 and 2300 m, or elephant fragmented forests between 1200 and 1600 m. We conclude that high temperature and humidity together with a vertically stratified canopy support epiphylls, whereas precipitation seasonality, disturbed vegetation with unstable microclimate, or dense, unstratified canopy discourage the development of epiphyllous communities. Our study illustrates that ecological niches of epiphyllous bryophytes are shaped by a complex interplay of multiple drivers, knowledge of which is essential for more realistic predictions of the impacts of current accelerated habitat loss on species distribution and diversity changes in the tropics.

AB  - Logging of tropical primary forests is a widely acknowledged global issue threatening biodiversity hotspots and indigenous communities leading to significant land erosion and decreased soil stability. The downstream effects of logging on human coastal communities include poor water quality and increased sedimentation. Quantifying the impacts of historical deforestation within a watershed requires accurate data from river discharge or satellite images, which are rarely available prior to the 1980s. In the absence of these in situ measurements, proxies have successfully produced accurate, long-range, historical records of temperature, hydrological balance, and sediment discharge in coastal and oceanic environments. We present a 30-year, monthly resolved Ba/Ca proxy record of sediment in river discharge as measured from the skeletal remains of massive corals Porites sp. from northern Malaysian Borneo. We make the comparison with local instrumental hydrology data, river discharge and rainfall, to test the reliability of the Ba/Cacoral proxy. Our results show that averaging five records into two composites results in significant positive annual correlations with river discharge (r = 0.5 and r = 0.59) as well as a difference in correlation strength coherent with distance from the river mouth, with the composite closer to the river mouth displaying a higher correlation. More importantly, Ba/Cacoral records from this region showed a very similar upward trend to that of river discharge on multi-decennial timescales. The lack of similar increase and overall stability in the precipitation record suggests that the river discharge's trend recorded by corals is linked to the increasing land use associated with ever-growing deforestation. We argue that massive corals in this region are therefore valuable archives of past hydrological conditions and accurately reflect changes in land use patterns.

AB  - Root-associated fungi (RAF) influence plant growth and maintain multiple ecosystem functions. However, the relationship between the temporal dynamics of RAF communities and climate conditions and host phenology are less clear, especially in desert ecosystems. Therefore, intra-annual patterns of RAF can reveal their influence on Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica, an important sand control species. We sampled the roots of P. sylvestris of three age groups (27, 33, and 44 years) from April to September in the Mu Us Desert. Subsequently, taxonomic and functional groups of the RAF were identified using Illumina amplicon sequencing and the FUNGuild platform, respectively. The results indicated that (1) the alpha diversity indices were significantly different among sampling months but not among stand ages; the richness of symbiotrophic fungi was higher than that of saprotrophic fungi or pathotrophic fungi. (2) The major functional guilds were identified as ectomycorrhizal (especially Rhizopogon, Geopora, Russula, and Amphinema) and undefined saprotrophs. The monthly differences in RAF were mainly affected by climate factors, especially mean temperature and precipitation. (3) There were highly connected and low modularized networks in July and August, and the topological alterations across stand age did not fluctuate. The keystone genera that potentially to provide ecological functions showed dynamic changes in the P. sylvestris plantation. The determinants of temporal variations in RAF communities on an intra-annual scale in desert environments were climate conditions and host phenology, which showed that during the main growing season of the host when the relatively high temperatures and humidity were high, there were higher levels of fungal diversity, more diverse community composition and a more complex fungal co-occurrence network. These results highlight the importance of interactions between community functions of RAF and forest growth and health.

AB  - Purpose of Review Predicting, preventing, and minimizing machinery-induced soil compaction are of paramount importance in forest ecosystems. Understanding the soil's susceptibility to compaction is crucial in achieving these goals. This meta-analysis assessed the relevance of climatic and soil conditions for the susceptibility of forest soils to wood-harvesting-associated compaction across global climatic zones. We utilized soil bulk density change data (effect sizes; compacted versus uncompacted) from 81 forest sites worldwide, and mapped global patterns of the susceptibility of forest soils to compaction using climate and soil data.Recent Findings Wood-harvesting operations by harvester-forwarder technologies disturb the soil less as compared to skidders and cable yarders. It has been shown that a high number of vehicle passages (> 20 times) lead to maximum soil damage, although this contradicts the general belief that major soil disturbance occurs within the first few vehicle passages. Despite these important findings, a global compilation of local information on forest soil compaction induced by mechanized wood harvesting is currently lacking. A map that illustrates the global pattern of soil susceptibility to compaction is also required to identify particularly susceptible forest regions.Summary Forest soils in tropical and temperate zones were most susceptible to compaction (48% and 30% bulk density increase, respectively), while forest soils in arid and cold zones were less susceptible (15% and 18% bulk density increase, respectively). Soils in tropical and temperate forests receive high annual precipitation amounts, are characterized by high soil organic carbon content and low bulk density, and are often wet, resulting in high susceptibility to compaction. Since tropical and temperate forests are biodiversity hotspots, forest managers and policymakers should pay particular attention to mechanized wood-harvesting operations in these zones, as the recovery of compacted forest soils requires decades.

AB  - Introduction. Fires in ecosystems, mostly after open burning, affect Ukrainian territory each year causing flora and fauna damage, soil degradation, pollutants emission, which impact air quality and human health. Fires influence the atmosphere by adding burned products and its further direct and indirect effects. Despite majority of fires are open burning, research of forest fire emissions prevail among Ukrainian scientists. Therefore, the study aimed to analyze the influence of all-type fires in Ukrainian ecosystems on substances fluxes to the atmosphere and possible changes of meteorological processes.
   Data and methodology. The study uses GFED4 data and inventories for analyses of forest and agricultural burned fraction, carbon and dry matter emissions for the period of 1997-2016. Additional data includes absorbed aerosol index derived from OMI (Aura) instrument and ground-based meteorological measurements.
   Results. Burning fraction indicates the 10 to 30% of area influencing in case of active fires. More than 90% of fires in Ukrainian ecosystems happened on the agricultural lands. The highest trends of active fires appear on the western and northern part of Ukraine, whereas burned fraction on the central territories reached up to 60% decreasing per decade. Most fires happened during two periods: March - April and July - September. The most severe fires occurred in 1999, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2021.
   Average emissions in Ukraine vary from 0.2 to 1.0 g.m(2).month(-1) for carbon and from 0.001 to 0.003 kg.m(2).month(-1) for dry matter. There are three localizations of huge burning products emissions, where maximal average values reach 1.8 g.m(2).month(-1) for carbon and 0.005 kg.m(2).month(-1) for dry matter. The biggest one occurred in the Polissia forest region. Despite the maximal emission from forest fires, open burning results the biggest coverage and air quality deteriorating.
   Absorbing aerosol index (AAI) could be good indicator of fires in Ukrainian ecosystems and burning products emissions. Overall, AAI with values more than 0.2 correspond to dry matter emissions of 0.005-0.01 kg.m(2).month(-1). If AAI exceed 0.4 usual dry matter emissions exceed 0.02 kg.m(2).month(-1).
   The study finds local scale changes of air temperature and days with precipitation due to huge burning products emissions. In case of monthly average AAI exceed 1.2 during fires events, positive air temperature anomaly at the ground decrease from 0.7 to 0.1 degrees C. The main reason is absorption of solar radiation in the atmosphere. During the next month after intensive fires in ecosystems, days with precipitation have twofold decrease: from 13-14 to 7 days with precipitation more than 0 mm, and from 2-3 to 1 day with precipitation more than 5 mm. The reason might be changes of cloudiness formation due to elevated concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols. The results obtained for atmospheric changes is planned to be verified and compared using online integrated atmospheric modelling.

AB  - Land-use intensification has led to biodiversity loss, which affects ecosystem properties and services by altering plant functional traits. However, the mechanistic pathways through which land-use intensity (LUI) affects ecosystem services across functional traits and ecosystem properties remain unclear. We studied the relationships among LUI, plant functional traits, ecosystem properties, and soil water conservation in tropical Hainan Island, China, where land-use changes, biodiversity loss, and seasonal drought have had severe impacts. Soil water conservation was represented by two complementary processes, namely soil water retention (SWR) and soil water capture (SWC). SWR and SWC were observed along a LUI gradient after 27 rainfall events (14 light, 10 moderate, and 3 heavy). We quantified the direct and indirect effects of LUI, the community-weighted mean (CWM) and functional divergence (FDvar) of water-related plant functional traits (tree height, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content), and ecosystem properties on SWC and SWR using Bayesian structural equation models. The results showed that LUI did not affect SWC and SWR directly but presented indirect impacts via functional traits and ecosystem properties. Importantly, tree height FDvar mediated the most important indirect effect of LUI on both SWC and SWR. Tree height FDvar indirectly affected SWC through ecosystem properties, while the direction of the effect changed from negative to positive with increasing rainfall intensity, and promoted SWR directly and indirectly by increasing litter fall and soil organic matter. Our results further provide evidence of an indirect effect of LUI on soil water conservation primarily through tree height FDvar. Loss of functional diversity of plant height caused by LUI resulted in a decrease in SWR and SWC, indicating that seasonal drought causes increased impacts. The results emphasize that maintaining functional diversity of tree height in tropical land use is conducive for soil water conservation to mitigate increased intensity of seasonal drought predicted under climate change.

AB  - Tropical tree diversity increases with rainfall(1,2). Direct physiological effects of moisture availability and indirect effects mediated by biotic interactions are hypothesized to contribute to this pantropical increase in diversity with rainfall(2-6). Previous studies have demonstrated direct physiological effects of variation in moisture availability on tree survival and diversity(5,7-10), but the indirect effects of variation in moisture availability on diversity mediated by biotic interactions have not been shown(11). Here we evaluate the relationships between interannual variation in moisture availability, the strength of density-dependent interactions, and seedling diversity in central Panama. Diversity increased with soil moisture over the first year of life across 20 annual cohorts. These first-year changes in diversity persisted for at least 15 years. Differential survival of moisture-sensitive species did not contribute to the observed changes in diversity. Rather, negative density-dependent interactions among conspecifics were stronger and increased diversity in wetter years. This suggests that moisture availability enhances diversity indirectly through moisture-sensitive, density-dependent conspecific interactions. Pathogens and phytophagous insects mediate interactions among seedlings in tropical forests(12-18), and many of these plant enemies are themselves moisture-sensitive(19-27). Changes in moisture availability caused by climate change and habitat degradation may alter these interactions and tropical tree diversity.

AB  - Leaf-cutter ants (LCAs) are widely distributed and alter the physical and biotic architecture above and below ground. In neotropical rainforests, they create aboveground and belowground disturbance gaps that facilitate oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange. Within the hyperdiverse neotropical rainforests, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi occupy nearly all of the forest floor. Nearly every cubic centimeter of soil contains a network of hyphae of Glomeromycotina, fungi that form arbuscular mycorrhizae. Our broad question is as follows: how can alternative mycorrhizae, which are-especially ectomycorrhizae-essential for the survival of some plant species, become established? Specifically, is there an ant-mycorrhizal fungus interaction that facilitates their establishment in these hyperdiverse ecosystems? In one lowland Costa Rican rainforest, nests of the LCA Atta cephalotes cover approximately 1.2% of the land surface that is broadly scattered throughout the forest. On sequencing the DNA from soil organisms, we found the inocula of many AM fungi in their nests, but the nests also contained the inocula of ectomycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, including Scleroderma sinnamariense, a fungus critical to Gnetum leyboldii, an obligate ectomycorrhizal plant. When the nests were abandoned, new root growth into the nest offered opportunities for new mycorrhizal associations to develop. Thus, the patches created by LCAs appear to be crucial sites for the establishment and survival of shifting mycorrhizal plant-fungal associations, in turn facilitating the high diversity of these communities. A better understanding of the interactions of organisms, including cross-kingdom and ant-mycorrhizal fungal interactions, would improve our understanding of how these ecosystems might tolerate environmental change.

AB  - Vegetation affects local water balance partitioning via effects on incoming precipitation, local radiation balance and soil hydrological properties. The extent of these effects is related to plant functional traits, such that forest composition plays an important role in its hydrological function. Therefore, the selection of species in forest restoration processes is key to recovering ecological (including hydrological) function. However, most restoration projects often do not include functional criteria for species selection, and even less frequently they include ecohydrological functions, although many projects are intended to recover hydrological regulation. We explored the association between plant functional traits and ecohydrological function, indicated by precipitation partitioning in the canopy into stemflow and throughfall, in an 8-year watershed restoration project in the Central Andes of Colombia. We monitored stemflow and throughfall (both mean and variability) on planted individuals from ten native tree species for almost two years and measured functional traits that describe tree crowns and are associated with rainfall partitioning. We found that stemflow and throughfall behavior is generally inverse and differ among species, with the highest variability in mean stemflow and coefficient of variation of throughfall. Furthermore, our results show that stemflow and throughfall are significantly associated with tree crown functional traits (R-2 = 0.74 for crown area and R-2 = 0.62 for crown density x volume). Besides, the studied species are organized in a variation space of ecohydrological processes and crown functional traits (first two principal components from PCA explain 71.7% of data variability). They are organized from wider/less dense crowns in Alnus acuminata to smaller/denser crowns in Quercus humboldtii, which significantly influenced the temporal variability of stemflow and throughfall, respectively. Other species are located intermittently along this variation space. From a multivariate perspective, our species were differentiated into four discrete groups based on similar functional traits and, therefore, with similar effects on ecohydrological processes. This suggests a complementary effect of different species on the ecosystem hydrological functions, thus highlighting the importance of considering diversity on ecosystem management and ecological restoration for the recovery of ecosystem integrity.

AB  - The Dry Afromontane forests in Northern Ethiopia have been cleared for agriculture and reduced to small and isolated fragments. Most of these forests are located around church territories and are they called church forests. The church forests are known to be biodiversity islands and provide key ecosystem services to local communities. However, to date, the fungal resources of these forests have not been assessed and, therefore, the contribution of fungi to their conservation value is unknown. In 2019, we investigated the fungal diversity of three Dry Afromontane church forests. In each forest, we established nine permanent plots (2 m x 50 m), which were surveyed weekly during the rainy season to quantify the fungal diversity and sporocarp production levels. Explanatory variables were also analyzed to determine their relationship with macrofungal species composition. We collected 13,736 sporocarps corresponding to 188 taxa. Of these, 81% were saprotrophic and 14% were ectomycorrhizal. Sixty-eight species were edible, including economically valuable species such as Tricholoma and Termitomyces. This suggests that these fragmented forest systems could be managed to provide valuable non-timber forest products such as mushrooms and socioeconomic benefits for local communities. Although many species were present in all three forests, some were only found in one forest, highlighting the importance of conserving individual forests. The correlation of the Shannon diversity indices of the two communities showed a positive trend in spite of the lack of correlation between their richness. Macrofungal communities as a whole were influenced by edaphic, spatial and climate variables. This study indicates that church forests support a wide diversity of fungi, including potentially novel fungal species, and highlights the need for forest managers to consider the importance of fungi in forest ecosystem management and to provide habitats that will maintain fungal diversity and sporocarp production when planning conservation strategies.

AB  - Huanglongbing (HLB) vectored by Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) severely affects commercial plantations of Mexican lime (Citrus aurantifolia) in the dry tropic region of Mexico. Management of Huanglongbing is based on intensive use of agronomic practices such as irrigation, nutrition, pruning, and weed, insect pest, and disease control. During 2018 to 2022, the effect of black, white, aluminum, and green plastic mulches, a white polypropylene mesh (ground cover), and bare soil (traditional system), were evaluated on D. citri and incidence-severity (I-S) of Huanglongbing, and Mexican lime yields. Trees with all types of plastic mulch had less I-S during the first 13 months of the study (35 to 40% of affected foliage) compared to bare soil (74% of tree affected). Also, plots with plastic mulches had fewer Asian citrus psyllid adults (one to 16 insects/trap/week) as compared with bare soil (11 to 28 adults). Mulched treatments had a positive effect on fruit production. After 4 years, plots with white, aluminum, green, and black plastic yielded 41.6, 40.1, 39.6, and 34.9 t/ha. Bare soil yielded only 26.6 t/ha. The cost to install plastic mulches was $526/ha. Because of that, the plastics increased yields by 50-56% and the average price of Mexican lime fruit was about $600 per ton. This production system is an economically profitable alternative to the growers to coexist with Huanglongbing in the dry tropics of Mexico.

AB  - Industrial pollution is a significant global threat to biodiversity, but its consequences on rainforest ecosystems remain poorly understood. Amphibians are especially susceptible to pollutants released on natural environments due to their aquatic-terrestrial life cycle. Here, we explored the association of severe historical air, water, and soil pollution with physiological and morphological alterations on Rhinella ornata individuals, an endemic toad species of Atlantic Forest, a world biodiversity hotspot. We hypothesized that individuals sampled in sites closer to the pollution source will present worse indicators of health. As predicted, toads at decreasing distances from the pollution source presented enlargement of organs related to detoxification function (liver and kidneys) and compensatory immunological function (spleen). Contrary to our predictions, however, we do not found significant effects of proximity to the pollution source on individuals' body condition index, on the indicative of fertility (testicles masses) or on macroparasite infection's response (eosinophil counts). Surprisingly, proximity to the pollution source was associated with lower chronic stress levels (neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio) on individuals. We discuss which processes could promote the alterations found on the toads. We also discuss the possible acquirement of local resistance to contamination on toads populations closer from pollution source, giving the more than 60 years of exposure to chemical contaminants in the area.

AB  - Earthworms have potential to stabilize soil organic carbon (SOC), but the biophysical controls on SOC dynamics in earthworm casts and the SOC residence time in casts is poorly known. To this end, we aimed to investigate (1) the kinetics of SOC (de-) protection in earthworm casts deposited in a tropical environment and (2) changes in the spatial relationships between fresh particulate organic matter (POM) and pore architecture within casts. Our experimental approach was to espose casts produced by the anecic earthworm Amynthas adexilis to tropical temperature and rainfall by placing them in a woodland in northern Vietnam. For 400 d, we monitored the dynamics of cast microstructures using X-ray micro-computed tomography and compared them to those of the surrounding soil aggregates (control). We also measured potential CO2 emissions of the same samples in a laboratory incubation. As expected, recently egested casts had higher SOC (1.9-fold) and POM volumes (7-fold) than aggregates, whereas their total imaged porosity was 4 times less. The SOC of casts was more labile than SOC of aggregates, as casts had 3 times more potentially mineralizable SOC. By 72 d of exposure to field conditions, the casts and aggregates had similar potential SOC mineralization, indicating that they had developed a similar level of SOC protection. Temporal changes in SOC mineralization rates were related to variations in POM volume, particularly those connected to the outside of the cast. After 400 d of exposure, casts had still greater POM volumes (2.5-fold) and higher SOC contents (1.6-fold) but similar total imaged porosity and SOC stability as aggregates. In conclusion, these results clearly indicated the direct involvement of earthworms in SOC stabilization through their impact on POM and pore spatial arrangements, which may have led to prolonged SOC sequestration for > 400 d.

AB  - Tropical forests disappear rapidly because of deforestation, yet they have the potential to regrow naturally on abandoned lands. We analyze how 12 forest attributes recover during secondary succession and how their recovery is interrelated using 77 sites across the tropics. Tropical forests are highly resilient to low-intensity land use; after 20 years, forest attributes attain 78% (33 to 100%) of their old-growth values. Recovery to 90% of old-growth values is fastest for soil (<1 decade) and plant functioning (<2.5 decades), intermediate for structure and species diversity (2.5 to 6 decades), and slowest for biomass and species composition (>12 decades). Network analysis shows three independent clusters of attribute recovery, related to structure, species diversity, and species composition. Secondary forests should be embraced as a low-cost, natural solution for ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - The afforestation of savannas, previously dedicated to extensive cattle ranching, with fast-growing forest species is a growing phenomenon in the Colombian Orinoquia. In order to estimate changes in the springtail communities due to the establishment of Acacia mangium in the savannas, their diversity in plantations of 1, 3 and 5 years was compared with savannas in a forestry project located in the municipality of Puerto Gaitan (Meta), during the dry and rainy season. Samples were obtained using pitfall traps exposed for 9 days in each season. Springtails richness and diversity among different plantations ages and savannas was estimated and compared in each season. Additionally, the composition was explained based on physicochemical variables of the soil and variables related to the structure of the plantations and management (RDA). Savanna afforestation produced changes in diversity and springtail assemblages. Differences among plantations and savannas were explained by changes in soil temperature and moisture, amount of clay, organic carbon, soil compaction and height of the plantation. It is concluded that early stages of the afforestation of savannas with A. mangium favors the diversity of springtails.

AB  - Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important component in forests, hosting a variety of organisms that have critical roles in nutrient cycling and carbon (C) storage. We developed a process-based model using literature, field observations, and expert knowledge to assess woody debris decomposition in forests and the movement of wood C into the soil and atmosphere. The sensitivity analysis was conducted against the primary ecological drivers (wood properties and ambient conditions) used as model inputs. The analysis used eighty-nine climate datasets from North America, from tropical (14.2 degrees N) to boreal (65.0 degrees N) zones, with large ranges in annual mean temperature (26.5 degrees C in tropical to -11.8 degrees C in boreal), annual precipitation (6,143 to 181 mm), annual snowfall (0 to 612 kg m(-2)), and altitude (3 to 2,824 m above mean see level). The sensitivity analysis showed that CWD decomposition was strongly affected by climate, geographical location and altitude, which together regulate the activity of both microbial and invertebrate wood-decomposers. CWD decomposition rate increased with increments in temperature and precipitation, but decreased with increases in latitude and altitude. CWD decomposition was also sensitive to wood size, density, position (standing vs downed), and tree species. The sensitivity analysis showed that fungi are the most important decomposers of woody debris, accounting for over 50% mass loss in nearly all climatic zones in North America. The model includes invertebrate decomposers, focusing mostly on termites, which can have an important role in CWD decomposition in tropical and some subtropical regions. The role of termites in woody debris decomposition varied widely, between 0 and 40%, from temperate areas to tropical regions. Woody debris decomposition rates simulated for eighty-nine locations in North America were within the published range of woody debris decomposition rates for regions in northern hemisphere from 1.6 degrees N to 68.3 degrees N and in Australia.

AB  - Understanding the factors that make a site susceptible to invasion is essential to mitigate the impacts of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) on biodiversity. Miconia crenata is one of the few IAPS that can colonize undisturbed tropical rainforests. In this study, we investigate the abundance of Miconia crenata in disturbed and undisturbed lowland mixed dipterocarp forest and Kerangas forests in Sabah, Malaysia. Three 400 m long transects were established within each of the four sites. The transects ran from the forest edge into the interior, and eight 25 m2 plots were established at fixed distances along each transect. A further twenty 100 m2 plots were established in each of the undisturbed sites of Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve. We found that the density of Miconia crenata was significantly lower along the transects in the Kerangas forest, compared to mixed dipterocarp forest. Miconia crenata densities were also significantly lower along transects in the undisturbed forest compared to the disturbed forest. Within the undisturbed sites, Miconia crenata was 13 times more abundant in the mixed dipterocarp forest compared to the Kerangas forest. This difference in Miconia crenata abundance between the two forest types is probably due to soil fertility, with fertile sites more susceptible to invasion by Miconia crenata.

AB  - Many studies have assessed the concept of geodiversity. Most studies have focused on large spatial scales, ranging from watersheds to landscapes. Recent studies from the Israeli drylands indicate that shrubs and trees growing in lowgeodiversity sites experience mass mortality following longterm droughts, whilst those in high-geodiversity sites demonstrate high durability. Our objective was to review the relevance of small-scale geodiversity to the slow onset effects of climate change defined by the UN-FCCC, including land and forest degradation, biodiversity loss, and desertification. We propose that patch-scale to hillslope-scale geodiversity alleviate these effects. Also, we demonstrate: (1) how geodiversity coincides with the concepts of biodiversity hotspots, ecological niches, and climatic refugia, and (2) how human-restored geodiversity may be beneficial in conservation projects.

AB  - The biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship has received significant attention in recent decades. It has been widely demonstrated that plant diversity plays a crucial role in enhancing the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. However, few studies have tested the influence of plant species richness in mediating the impacts of climate on ecosystem functions at large spatial scales.To address this gap, we utilized data from field surveys across broad climatic gradients at the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Our goal was to examine the importance of plant species richness for the functioning of alpine grassland ecosystems, specifically productivity and soil carbon sequestration.Our results showed strong positive correlations between ecosystem functioning and growing season precipitation as well as species richness. In contrast, there was a negative correlation with growing season temperature. Notably, the positive effect of growing season precipitation on ecosystem functioning outweighed the negative effect of growing season temperature. The indirect effects of growing season precipitation and temperature on ecosystem functioning through changes in species richness were weak. Furthermore, the inclusion of climate factors in the model weakened the relationships between species richness and ecosystem functioning.Synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that climate factors are more important than species richness for the provisioning of ecosystem functions at large spatial scales. In summary, our study underscores the importance of considering climate factors alongside species richness when assessing ecosystem functioning across extensive geographical areas.

AB  - In New Caledonia wildfires and invasive mammals (deer and wild pigs) constitute the major agents of land surface degradation. Our study reveals the linkage between land cover and water balance on the northeast coast of New Caledonia (2400 mm annual rainfall) located on a micaschist basement. The hydrological regime of characteristic and representative land surfaces is assessed using a 1-year record from three 100 m(2) plots each, located in a forest area degraded by an invasive fauna, in a woody savannah which is regularly burned, and in a healthy forest area. The three plots present highly contrasting hydrological regimes, with annual and maximum runoff/rain ratios during a rain event of, respectively, 0.82, 0.16, 0.03, and 2.7, 0.7, 0.2, for the degraded forest, the savannah and the healthy forest. Such results suggest that subsurface flow originating from the contributing area above the degraded forest plot should exfiltrate inside the plot. A conceptual model for the degraded forest plot shows that water exfiltrating inside the plot represents 61% of the observed runoff. In savannahs, water should mainly be transferred downstream by subsurface flow within a thick organic soil layer limited by an impervious clay layer at a 20-30 cm depth. Savannahs are generally located above forests and generate the transfer of rainwater to downslope forests. Exfiltration into the forests can be the result of this transfer and depends on the thickness and permeability of the forest topsoils and on topographic gradients. Water exfiltration in forest areas highly degraded by pigs and deer enhances erosion and increases further degradation. It probably also limits percolation in the areas located downstream by increasing the amount of superficial runoff concentrated in gullies.

AB  - Although once considered a 'counterfeit paradise', the Amazon Basin is now a region of increasing interest in discussions of pre-colonial tropical land-use and social complexity. Archaeobotany, archaeozoology, remote sensing and palaeoecology have revealed that, by the Late Holocene, populations in different parts of the Amazon Basin were using various domesticated plants, modifying soils, building earthworks, and even forming 'Garden Cities' along the Amazon River and its tributaries. However, there remains a relatively limited understanding as to how diets, environmental management, and social structures varied across this vast area. Here, we apply stable isotope analysis to human remains (n = 4 for collagen, n = 17 for tooth enamel), and associated fauna (n = 61 for collagen, n = 28 for tooth enamel), to directly determine the diets of populations living in the Volta Grande do Rio Xingu, an important region of pre-Columbian cultural interactions, between 390 cal. years BC and 1,675 cal. years AD. Our results highlight an ongoing dietary focus on C-3 plants and wild terrestrial fauna and aquatic resources across sites and time periods, with varying integration of C-4 plants (i.e. maize). We argue that, when compared to other datasets now available from elsewhere in the Amazon Basin, our study highlights the development of regional adaptations to local watercourses and forest types.

AB  - Environmental conditions play an important role in controlling the fate of organic carbon (OC) in earthworm casts. However, the mechanisms that lead to the destabilization of OC in casts deposited in different land use systems are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of land use on the fate and composition of particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) in earthworm casts under tropical conditions. We conducted a 400-day field exposure experiment in a woodland and a meadow in northern Vietnam with earthworm casts and soil aggregates without trace of earthworm activity (reference soil) under natural rainfall conditions. We analyzed the element content, stable carbon isotope composition and midinfrared signatures of the two types of materials after 9 and 400 days of field exposure. The results showed that the casts were initially enriched in OC as compared to the reference soils, with the MAOM fraction accounting for over 90% of the earthworm-induced OC accumulation. The POM fraction occluded in casts consisted of fresh plant material and disappeared during the 400 days of field exposure. Enrichment and composition of OC differed between woodland and meadow casts. POM and MAOM showed contrasting persistence in the two land use systems. While woodland casts showed the highest potential to stabilize OC, the actual amount of cast OC stabilized for more than 400 days was more important under meadow. The processes affecting cast OC dynamics were contrasting in both systems. Under woodland, cast OC destabilization was most probably related to microbial degradation, while under meadow, OC accumulation was most probably related to root activity. Our study highlights that the impact of earthworms on the origin, composition, and fate of cast OC in tropical environments is strongly influenced by land use.

AB  - Forest ecosystems sequester approximately half of the world's organic carbon (C), most of it in the soil. The amount of soil C stored depends on the input and decomposition rate of soil organic matter (OM), which is controlled by the abundance and composition of the microbial and invertebrate communities, soil physico-chemical properties, and (micro)-climatic conditions. Although many studies have assessed how these site-specific climatic and soil properties affect the decomposition of fresh OM, differences in the type and quality of the OM substrate used, make it difficult to compare and extrapolate results across larger scales. Here, we used standard wood stakes made from aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) to explore how climate and abiotic soil properties affect wood decomposition across 44 unharvested forest stands located across the northern hemisphere. Stakes were placed in three locations: (i) on top of the surface organic horizons (surface), (ii) at the interface between the surface organic horizons and mineral soil (interface), and (iii) into the mineral soil (mineral). Decomposition rates of both wood species was greatest for mineral stakes and lowest for stakes placed on the surface organic horizons, but aspen stakes decomposed faster than pine stakes. Our models explained 44 and 36% of the total variation in decomposition for aspen surface and interface stakes, but only 0.1% (surface), 12% (interface), 7% (mineral) for pine, and 7% for mineral aspen stakes. Generally, air temperature was positively, precipitation negatively related to wood stake decomposition. Climatic variables were stronger predictors of decomposition than soil properties (surface C:nitrogen ratio, mineral C concentration, and pH), regardless of stake location or wood species. However, climate-only models failed in explaining wood decomposition, pointing toward the importance of including local-site properties when predicting wood decomposition. The difficulties we had in explaining the variability in wood decomposition, especially for pine and mineral soil stakes, highlight the need to continue assessing drivers of decomposition across large global scales to better understand and estimate surface and belowground C cycling, and understand the drivers and mechanisms that affect C pools, CO2 emissions, and nutrient cycles.

AB  - Riparian buffers, located in the transition zone between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, are a hotspot for nitrogen (N) removal through denitrification. Earthworms are abundant in riparian buffers and may enhance denitrification. This study investigated earthworm demographics of three earthworm functional groups (anecic, epigeic, and endogeic) and denitrifier activity in temporarily flooded and non-flooded riparian soils from April to October 2012 in southern Quebec, Canada. Nine earthworm species, mostly endogeic, were found in the temporarily flooded soil, while only six earthworm species were found in the non-flooded soil. On average, there were 11.7 times more earthworms with 12.4 times greater biomass (P < 0.05) found in the temporarily flooded soil than in the non-flooded soil. The denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was of similar magnitude in temporarily flooded and non-flooded soils, with temporal variation associated with rainfall patterns. Endogeic earthworm biomass was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with DEA, while epigeic earthworm biomass was positively correlated (P < 0.05) with 16S rRNA gene copies and nosZ gene copies from bacteria, indicating an association between earthworm functional groups and denitrifier activity in riparian soils. Stepwise multiple regressions showed that DEA in riparian soils could be predicted using soil moisture, inorganic N concentration, and earthworm functional groups, suggesting that endogeic and epigeic earthworms contributed to denitrifier activity in riparian soils.

AB  - Dendroclimatic records in areas with high relative humidity and low thermal amplitude are manifestly scarcer and only a few studies are applied to species that are present in areas with weak seasonality. The Azores archipelago with temperate climate, with low thermal amplitude, has unique biodiversity, including the Azorean holly, Ilex azorica Gand., that is dominant in most extant natural forests. Hence, the importance of understanding its behavior and relation with climate. In this study, we try to understand tree-ring patterns of this species and examine the relationship between radial tree growth and main climatic drivers. For this purpose, we sampled four populations from Sao Miguel Island and two from Terceira Island. We found a diffuse-ring porous wood with a common layer of vessels associated to the ring boundary, which was critical to identify annual tree-rings. Generalized linear models were used to relate different variations of temperature and precipitation parameters, resulting into a diverse climate-growth relationships of different populations, while the composite population exhibited pronounced effect of temperature. We conclude that, I. azorica forms reliable annual tree-rings, which can be statistically related to climate, mostly temperature. However, there are differences among specific sites, thus the climate sensitivity depends on other site characteristics, such as soil and slope, but probable also to other ecological drivers, such as the competition, water drainage, among others.

AB  - Scientific and public interest in acid deposition and its ecological impacts have increased throughout 1990s in East Asia (Northeast and Southeast Asia). After being established in 2001, the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia (EANET) celebrates the 20th anniversary in 2021, and is now being expanded in scope reflecting the shifting social concern from acid deposition to broader air quality and climate change in recent years. This paper reviews the past 30 years of development of scientific research and policy related to acid deposition in East Asia. Since the onset of the twenty-first century, East Asia has had the highest SO2 and NOx emissions in the world by continents, with substantial economic developmental inequality among countries. An overview of studies on sulfur and nitrogen deposition, the acidification of inland water and forest soil, and forest decline reveal that although limited acidification of inland water and forest soils have been documented, no decline in the populations of fish and other aquatic biota has been reported in East Asia. After a review of policy-oriented modeling studies on source receptor relationships and the critical loads of sulfur and nitrogen in East Asia, the history of EANET and its success and challenges are discussed. Finally, the importance of epistemic communities as the interface between science and policy in the region is discussed. Regional governance and cooperation are essential for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases, especially short-lived climate pollutants and atmospheric pollutants to realize the co-benefits of global climate change mitigation and improved air quality.

AB  - Land conversion for intensive agriculture produces unfavorable changes to soil ecosystems, causing global concern. Soil bacterial communities mediate essential terrestrial ecosystem processes, making it imperative to understand their responses to agricultural perturbations. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing coupled with a functional gene array to study temporal dynamics of soil bacterial communities over 1 year under different disturbance intensities across a U.S. Southern Plains agroecosystem, including tallgrass prairie, Old World bluestem pasture, no-tillage (NT) canola, and conventional tillage (CT) wheat. Land use had the greatest impact on bacterial taxonomic diversity, whereas sampling time and its interaction with land use were central to functional diversity differences. The main drivers of taxonomic diversity were tillage > sampling time > temperature, while all measured factors explained similar amounts of variations in functional diversity. Temporal differences had the strongest correlation with total nitrogen > rainfall > nitrate. Within land uses, community variations for CT wheat were attributed to nitrogen levels, whereas soil organic matter and soil water content explained community variations for NT canola. In comparison, all measured factors contributed almost equally to variations in grassland bacterial communities. Finally, functional diversity had a stronger relationship with taxonomic diversity for CT wheat compared to phylogenetic diversity in the prairie. These findings reinforce that tillage management has the greatest impact on bacterial community diversity, with sampling time also critical. Hence, our study highlights the importance of the interaction between temporal dynamics and land use in influencing soil microbiomes, providing support for reducing agricultural disturbance to conserve soil biodiversity. IMPORTANCE Agricultural sustainability relies on healthy soils and microbial diversity. Agricultural management alters soil conditions and further influences the temporal dynamics of soil microbial communities essential to ecosystem functions, including organic matter dynamics, nutrient cycling, and plant nutrient availability. Yet, the responses to agricultural management are also dependent on soil type and climatic region, emphasizing the importance of assessing sustainability at local scales. To evaluate the impact of agricultural management practices, we examined bacterial communities across a management disturbance gradient over 1 year in a U.S. Southern Plains agroecosystem and determined that intensive management disturbance and sampling time critically impacted bacterial structural diversity, while their interactive effect influenced functional diversity and other soil health indicators. Overall, this study provides insights into how reducing soil disturbance can positively impact microbial community diversity and soil properties in the U.S. Southern Plains.

AB  - Avocado (Persea americana) production is increasing in Kenya, with both small and largeholder farming for domestic and export markets. However, one of main challenges that limit production is infestation by insect pests, notably the oriential fruit fly Bactocera dorsalis and Ceratitis spp. fruit flies, which cause direct crop losses and are indirectly responsible for non-tariff trade barriers due to stringent export requirements. Data on weekly pest trap counts were collected between September 2017 and December 2020 within orchards in avocado plantations. Fuzzy neural network (FNN) were used to model the population dynamics of B. dorsalis and Ceratitis spp. Weekly pest counts, rainfall, average temperature, relative humidity and avocado plant physiological stages were used for predictive modeling in different orchards. The performance of the resulting models was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative approximation error (MRAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). FNN models achieved satisfactory results in predicting the dynamics of the pests in the orchards, with most of the models obtaining R-2 > 0.85. We demonstrated how FNN models can be used as predictive tools for managing and controlling fruit fly pest populations in these plantations, and how they may be suitable to predict fruit fly or other pests in similar cropping systems. Once the input variables are known, they can be loaded into the FNN models to predict field pest populations, and based on threshold values, allow for implementation of timely and adequate control measures such as the use of biopesticides.

AB  - Artificial light at night (ALAN) demonstrated a new ecological factor that influences organisms through a multi-approach. Yet, the impacts of ALAN on understory plants remain largely unknown. We evaluated whether ALAN would affect the leaf mass per area (LMA) of understory plants through a two-year field light experiment in a tropical rubber plantation in south China. We hypothesized that ALAN could impact the understory in two ways: by directly supplementing light to aboveground plant parts (which increases LMA) and indirectly affecting soil nutrient composition by attracting insects (which decreases LMA). We selected two species: Colocasia gigantea, representing shade-tolerant species, and Melastoma candidum, representing light-demanding species. We measured canopy openness, LMA, soil nutrients, and individual distance away from light resources. Our Bayesian linear mixed model showed a negative relationship between LMA and the strength of ALAN, indicating that ALAN may influence LMA more indirectly by enhancing soil nutrient availability rather than directly acting as a light resource. This relationship was significant for Colocasia gigantea but not for Melastoma candidum. These results suggest that ALAN might have complex and species-specific impacts on the understory ecosystem. Our study underscores the need for continued research and informed management of anthropogenic ecosystems.

AB  - Lichens play crucial roles in sustaining the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems; however, the diversity and ecological factors associated with lichenised soil fungi remain poorly understood.
   To address this knowledge gap, we used a global field survey including information on fungal sequences of topsoils from 235 terrestrial ecosystems.
   We identified 880 lichenised fungal phylotypes across nine biomes ranging from deserts to tropical forests. The diversity and proportion of lichenised soil fungi peaked in shrublands and dry grasslands. Aridity index, plant cover and soil pH were the most important factors associated with the distribution of lichenised soil fungi. Furthermore, we identified Endocarpon, Verrucaria and Rinodina as some of the most dominant lichenised genera across the globe, and they had similar environmental preferences to the lichenised fungal community. In addition, precipitation seasonality and mean diurnal temperature range were also important in predicting the proportion of these dominant genera. Using this information, we were able to create the first global maps of the richness and the proportion of dominant genera of lichenised fungi.
   This work provides new insight into the global distribution and ecological preferences of lichenised soil fungi, and supports their dominance in drylands across the globe.

AB  - Tree plantings have the potential to increase species diversity and sequester carbon, yet planting failure and early mortality pose significant barriers to their success. Biodiversity-ecosystem function theory suggests that diverse tree plantings could improve survival outcomes through either the portfolio or facilitation effect, yet there remain few tests of this hypothesis. Here, we use a large-scale tree-diversity experiment (BiodiversiTREE), with monitoring of nearly 8,000 individual trees to test whether (1) tree species diversity increases survival rates, (2) tree diversity stabilizes the risk of planting failure, and/or (3) diversity effects are important relative to other common drivers of seedling mortality (e.g. herbivory and soil moisture). We found that only species identity significantly impacted the likelihood of survival, not plant functional diversity nor plot species richness nor phylogenetic diversity. There were minor effects of elevation and soil moisture on survival, but both explained a very small amount of variation in the data (r(marg)(2) <= 0.011). Higher tree diversity did, however, strongly reduce variation in survival across plots, with nearly 2-fold higher coefficients of variation in monocultures (30.4%, 28.4-32.6% 95% bootstrapped confidence interval) compared to 4- (16.3%, 13.8-18.7%) and 12-species plots (12.8%, 10.8-14.7%). Ultimately, our results suggest that employing diverse species can lower the risk of planting failure (i.e. the portfolio effect), but that species selection still plays a large role in early establishment.

AB  - Planted forests account for 70% of the world's forest area. Over the past 30 years, the area of planted forests has been increasing worldwide and as a natural climate solution for carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The impact of climate change on forest sustainability is complex and the question of how to maintain the long-term stable growth of plantations is a global technical problem. Since the 1950s, a large area of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica plantation has been built for wind prevention and sand fixation, and soil and water conservation in northern China, which has become an important part of the green ecological barrier in North China. At present, part of the Three-North Shelterbelt Forest Program has declined, especially P. sylvestris plantation. Although a lot of research has been carried out on the decline of P. sylvestris plantation on sandy land, at present, the understanding of the decline mechanism is still unclear. Most of the previous studies focused on the water factor, and considered that the water deficit in the introduction site was the main factor leading to the decline of P. sylvestris plantation, focusing on the soil water change, water balance and water use strategy. However, the physiological mechanism of the decline and even death of P. sylvestris caused by water deficit is still unclear, and there is a lack of research on the response and regulation mechanism of the non-structural carbon to water deficit, especially the interaction between diseases and pests, hydraulic failure and carbon starvation during the decline process of P. sylvestris. In this paper, the main factors leading to the decline of P. sylvestris plantation are summarized and a conceptual model of the decline process is proposed. Hydraulic failure and carbon starvation are the two main physiological mechanisms leading to the decline of P. sylvestris plantation. Hydraulic failure and carbon starvation reduced the ability of P. sylvestris to resist pests and diseases, while pests further promoted the development of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation until P. sylvestris seriously declined or even died. Future research should focus on the physiological process of P. sylvestris decline and its interaction with pests and diseases. The following aspects should be strengthened: (1) The synergistic mechanism of multiple factors on declined P. sylvestris plantations, such as the interaction between diseases and insect pests and hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, the impact of the interaction between diseases and insect pests and drought on the hydraulic characteristics and NSC, the impact of NSC on the synthesis of metabolites resistant to diseases and insect pests; (2) the decline mechanism of P. sylvestris plantation on stand or landscape scale based on the study of individual scale and the ecological response mechanism to environmental factors at stand or landscape scale; (3) the P. sylvestris plantation response to environmental stress and its regulation mechanism, such as how to balance the hydraulic efficiency and safety, and the strategic model of xylem water transport and NSC regulation in response to drought and other emergencies; (4) the suitable range of ecological suitability evaluation of P. sylvestris plantation based on long-term positioning observation data analysis.

AB  - global level, ecological restoration is becoming increasingly important due to the degraded conditions of ecosystems, which requires urgent efforts to recover these ecosystems and reestablish ecosystem services and forest biodiversity. However, there is a scarcity of studies evaluating the effects of forest restoration programs on soil properties and ecohydrological functioning of tropical ecosystems, which are in rapid decline. This research aims to evaluate ecohydrological processes in two low montane moist forest (bh-MB) watersheds subjected to ecological restoration (El Silencio and Montanita), compared to one with pastures (Pastos), and to characterize the variables influencing these processes in emerging ecosystems. In each watershed, climatic variables were monitored, the physical, hydraulic and organic matter properties of the soil were measured, along with ecohydrological variables. The results indicate that watersheds under the restoration program exhibit a tendency to recover the initial conditions of soil properties, favoring the regulation of summer flows and reducing storm flows. In contrast, the pasture watershed shows a tendency towards degraded soils. The natural regeneration process of the forest in areas dedicated to extensive cattle raising contributes to improving the physical conditions of the This improvement, in turn, facilitates water recharge to the aquifers and sustains the base flow during periods of low precipitation.

AB  - Protected areas are critical for providing ecosystem services. However, studies on the effect of protected areas on ecosystem service enhancement remain lacking, which restricts efficient protected area management. In this study, a statistical matching approach was used to analyze the role of 637 protected areas in China in enhancing ecosystem services. The drivers that influence the effectiveness of protected areas were also explored. The results show that 94% of the protected areas enhanced at least one type of the selected ecosystem services compared with the controls (unprotected areas), and protected areas in areas with high human activity disturbance or ecological fragility were more effective in enhancing ecosystem services than in other areas. At the national scale, the effectiveness of protected areas for carbon sequestration, soil conservation, and water yield services was mainly influenced by physical geographic variables (e.g., mean annual temperature, annual precipitation), and of habitat quality service also by socio-economic variables (e.g., road network density, distance to the nearest cropland). The main drivers in the various dry and wet climate regions differed from those operating at national scale, reflecting the spatial heterogeneity of natural and socio-economic conditions. Our results provide useful information for application in protected area management.

AB  - Earthworms play an important role in soil processes and ecosystem services. Soil fauna responds quickly to any alteration in the soil environment induced by land-use changes. Earthworm distribution is usually diverse, and their populations fluctuate in relation to different soil variables and land use patterns of the soil. However, little is known about the impact of soil organic carbon pools (abiotic factors) and land-use changes on earthworm communities in north western Himalaya. This study examined distribution and diversity indices of earthworms and their relation to physico-chemical properties of soil. Earthworms were sampled from three different land-use systems (mixed forest, agricultural land and tea garden) in every season (summer, rainy and winter) from two different depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm) from April 2019 to March 2021. We further identified earthworms and investigated physico-chemical properties of soil along with different carbon pools. A total of 13 earthworm species belonging to three families (Megascolecidae, Lumbricidae, Octochaetidae) were identified, out of which Amynthas corticis (Kinberg, 1867) was the most abundant species and found in all land-use systems. Mixed forest showed the highest H index, Margalef index and also have good nutrient content. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed a significant positive impact of abiotic factors on the distribution of earthworms. Our results indicate that earthworm diversity indices are strongly and positively correlated with the organic carbon pools of soil, which might become the potential factor in influencing the earthworm community pattern in north western Himalaya.

AB  - Testate amoebae (TA) are important components of soil ecosystems, where they play an essential role in belowground food webs. In this study, we examined species composition, diversity, and structure of TA assemblages in soils beneath tree crowns (microscale) at three slope positions (mesoscale) in subtropical urban parks in Shenzhen, China. Forty-two species of TA belonging to 18 genera were identified in 81 samples. TA assemblages were the most diverse and abundant in the center of the tree crown comparing with other under-tree habitats. Foot of the hills harbored higher TA abundance and diversity comparing with upper locations along the hillslopes. The distribution of TA was mostly driven by under-crown and hillside positions but not by elementary environmental conditions such as pH, moisture content and thickness of leaf litter layer. None of later factors were sufficient in shaping TA assemblage composition. The findings of our study suggest that in regional studies of soil microbial eukaryotes both micro- (i.e., under-crown) and mesoscale (i.e., the slope position) heterogeneity should be considered.

AB  - In conventional coffee farming, soil fauna can be negatively affected by the intensive management practices adopted and the use of an agroforestry system (AFS) is an alternative to reduce these impacts. In coffee AFS, soil nutrition is provided mainly using organic fertilizers. This soil management favors the microbiota and can alter the population dynamics of some organisms. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of organic fertilizers on the nematode community in coffee AFS and to determine their impact on soil ecology. Soil samples were collected from three coffee AFS and a nearby Atlantic rainforest fragment. Nematodes were extracted from the samples and identified to the genus. The identified populations were compared using several community and diversity indices to determine the environmental conditions of the systems under evaluation. No differences in total abundance among nematode communities were found in the four areas evaluated. Regarding trophic groups, the coffee AFS treated with either cow manure or poultry litter favored the trophic group of bacterivores. Plant-parasitic nematodes were more abundant in soils of both the naturally fertilized coffee AFS and the Atlantic rainforest fragment. The maturity and structural indexes indicated that the Atlantic rainforest fragment and the naturally fertilized coffee AFS had similar ecological functions. On the other hand, soils fertilized with cow manure were less diverse, had higher dominance in the community, and showed less ecological stability. The nematode communities found in the AFS were similar to those seen in the forest fragment indicating that is possible to produce coffee sustainably without negatively affecting soil quality.

AB  - Forest canopies buffer the macroclimate and thus play an important role in mitigating climate-warming impacts on forest ecosystems. Despite the importance of the tree layer for understory microclimate buffering, our knowledge about the effects of forest structure, composition and their interactions with macroclimate is limited, especially in mixtures of conifers and broadleaves. Here we studied five mixed forest stands along a 1800 km latitudinal gradient covering a 7 degrees C span in mean annual temperature. In each of these forests we established 40 plots (200 in total), in which air and soil temperatures were measured continuously for at least one year. The plots were located across gradients of forest density and broadleaved proportions (i.e. from open to closed canopies, and from 100% conifer to 100% broadleaved tree dominance). Air minimum, mean and maximum temperature offsets (i.e. difference between macroclimate and microclimate) and soil mean temperature offsets were calculated for the coldest and warmest months. Forest structure, and especially forest density, was the key determinant of understory temperatures. However, the absolute and relative importance of the proportion of broadleaves and forest density differed largely between response variables. Forest density ranged from being independent of, to interacting with, tree species composition. The effect of these two variables was independent of the macroclimate along our latitudinal gradient. Temperature, precipitation, snow depth and wind outside forests affected understory temperature buffering. Finally, we found that the scale at which the overstory affects soil microclimate approximated 6-7 m, whereas for air microclimate this was at least 10 m. These findings have implications for biodiversity conservation and forest management in a changing climate, as they facilitate the projection of understory temperatures in scenarios where both forest structure and macroclimate are dynamic. This is especially relevant given the global importance of ongoing forest conversion from conifers to broadleaves, and vice versa.

AB  - The ways traditional rural communities conduct activities to meet their livelihoods commonly contribute to conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Traditional agroforestry systems (TAFS) are expressions of management that deliberately retain wild vegetation coexisting with crops to obtain multiple socio-ecological contributions. However, processes enhancing productive intensification endanger their permanence. This study aimed to 1) identify the peasants' motivations to maintain the vegetation of tropical dry forest within their agricultural fields, 2) analyze the capacity of TAFS to provide contributions to people's well-being, and 3) identify factors and processes limiting conservation capacities and possible alternatives. The study was conducted in three communities of the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Valley, Oaxaca, Mexico. We performed a qualitative analysis with information from two workshops with local people, 10 semi-structured interviews with managers of TAFS, participant observation, complementary informal talks, and fieldwork notes. For analyzing the data, we: 1) generated a list of central themes based on the data collected, 2) established preliminary categories of such themes, 3) coded all information through the Atlas. ti software, 4) adjusted the classification of categories and codes to the data, 5) grouped codes and analyzed their relationships. We found that the peasants' motivations to maintain the wild vegetation are the provision of multiple beneficial contributions: material (edible fruit, medicinal plants, fodder, firewood), regulating (shade, soil fertility, humidity keeping, rain attraction), and nonmaterial (regional flavors, ornamental, ritual), among others, which meet some of their fundamental needs (primarily subsistence, identity, and protection). The main reasons for keeping the wild vegetation were material contributions (62%). Also, we observed that TAFS safeguarding a higher forest cover and species diversity provide a broader range of socio-ecological contributions and potential to satisfy human needs than those with lower cover. Peasant agriculture may allow maintaining biodiversity while satisfying fundamental human needs. However, it needs to be revitalized, made more efficient, profitable, and dignified. The agroecological management implemented by peasants in TAFS is crucial for ensuring the continuity of essential environmental functions and people's well-being.

AB  - In 1994, a network of small catchments (GEOMON) was established in the Czech Republic to determine input-output element fluxes in semi-natural forest ecosystems recovering from anthropogenic acidification. The network consists from 16 catchments and the primary observations of elements fluxes were complemented by monitoring of biomass stock, element pools in soil and vegetation, and the main water balance components. Over last three decades, reductions of SO2, NOx and NH3 emissions were followed by sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) deposition reductions of 75% and 30%, respectively. Steeper declines of strong acid anion concentrations compared to cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K, NH4) in precipitation resulted in precipitation pH increase from 4.5 to 5.2 in bulk precipitation and from 4.0 to 5.1 in spruce throughfall. Stream chemistry responded to changes in deposition: S leaching declined. However at majority of catchments soils acted as a net source of S to runoff, delaying recovery. Stream pH increased at acidic streams (pH < 6) and aluminium concentration decreased. Stream nitrate (NO3) concentration declined by 60%, considerably more than N deposition. Stream NO3 concentration was tightly positively related to stream total dissolved nitrogen to total phosphorus (P) ratio, suggesting the role of P availability on N retention. Trends in dissolved organic carbon fluxes responded to both acidification recovery and to runoff temporal variation. An exceptional drought occurred between 2014 and 2019. Over this recent period, streamflow decreased by approximate to 40% on average compared to 1990s, due to the increases of soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration by approximate to 30% and declines in precipitation by approximate to 15% on average across the elevational gradient. Sharp decreases of stream runoff at catchments <650 m a.s.l. corresponded to areas of recent forest decline caused by bark beetle infestation on drought stressed spruce forests. Understanding of the interactions among legacies of acidification and eutrophication, drought effects on the water cycle and forest disturbance dynamics is requisite for effective management of forested ecosystems under anthropogenic influence.

AB  - Herbivore exclusion is implemented globally to recover ecosystems from grazing by introduced and native herbivores, but evidence for large-scale biodiversity benefits is inconsistent in arid ecosystems. We examined the effects of livestock exclusion on dryland plant richness and reproductive capacity. We collected data on plant species richness and seeding (reproductive capacity), rainfall, vegetation productivity and cover, soil strength and herbivore grazing intensity from 68 sites across 6500 km(2) of arid Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae) woodlands in central Australia between 2018 and 2020. Sites were on an actively grazed cattle station and two destocked conservation reserves. We used structural equation modeling to examine indirect (via soil or vegetation modification) versus direct (herbivory) effects of grazing intensity by two introduced herbivores (cattle, camels) and a native herbivore (red kangaroo), on seasonal plant species richness and seeding of all plants, and the richness and seeding of four plant groups (native grasses, forbs, annual chenopod shrubs, and palatable perennial shrubs). Non-native herbivores had a strong indirect effect on plant richness and seeding by reducing vegetative ground cover, resulting in decreased richness and seeding of native grasses and forbs. Herbivores also had small but negative direct impacts on plant richness and seeding. This direct effect was explained by reductions in annual chenopod and palatable perennial shrub richness under grazing activity. Responses to grazing were herbivore-dependent; introduced herbivore grazing reduced native plant richness and seeding, while native herbivore grazing had no significant effect on richness or seeding of different plant functional groups. Soil strength decreased under grazing by cattle but not camels or kangaroos. Cattle had direct effects on palatable perennial shrub richness and seeding, whereas camels had indirect effects, reducing richness and seeding by reducing the abundance of shrubs. We show that considering indirect pathways improves evaluations of the effects of disturbances on biodiversity, as focusing only on direct effects can mask critical mechanisms of change. Our results indicate substantial biodiversity benefits from excluding livestock and controlling camels in drylands. Reducing introduced herbivore impacts will improve soil and vegetation condition, ensure reproduction and seasonal persistence of species, and protect native plant diversity.

AB  - Precipitation and temperature regimes are the key factors that regulate the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the duration of dry periods in summer and different depths of snow cover in winter on heterotrophic soil respiration. The studies were carried out as part of a two-year field simulation experiment on gray soil (Haplic Luvisol) under the temperate continental climate (south of Moscow oblast). Three variants were forecasted: (1) simulation of mild weather with uniform irrigation of the soil in summer and the absence of freezing in winter, (2) simulation of two summer dry periods lasting 1-2 months with natural winter snow cover (control), (3) simulation of extreme weather with one long (similar to 3 months) dry period in summer and complete removal of snow cover in winter. Heterotrophic soil respiration was measured by the closed chamber method on bare fallow during two years of continuous experiment and one year after its completion. Median values of heterotrophic soil respiration for the entire period of the experiment in the three above-mentioned variants of the experiment were 38, 27 and 19 mg C/(m(2) x h), respectively. Two short dry periods led to an increase in heterotrophic soil respiration by 7-10%, which is associated both with the drying and rewetting cycles of the soil and with an increase in the mean summer temperature of a 20-cm soil layer by 1.5 degrees C. The prolonged dry period caused a decrease in heterotrophic soil respiration by 12-16% as a result of low soil moisture content. Soil freezing led to a strong decrease in winter heterotrophic soil respiration, which reached 34-55% in the control variant and 57-72% when the snow cover was removed. The frosty period (November-March) contributed 25-34% and 14-19% without and with soil freezing, respectively, to the annual CO2 flux from the soil. It was concluded that the lack of soil freezing caused by an increase in the depth of snow cover led to a more significant change in the annual heterotrophic soil respiration than the lack of precipitation in the summer season.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) are highly vulnerable to human activities. Understanding the relationships among multiple ESs and driving mechanisms are crucial for multi-objective management in complex social-ecological systems. The goals of this study are to quantitatively evaluate and identify ESs hotspots, explore the relationships among ESs and elucidate the driving mechanisms. Taking central urban area Chongqing municipality as the study area, biodiversity (BI), carbon fixation (CF), soil conservation (SC) and water conservation (WC) were evaluated based on the InVEST model and ESs hotspots were identified. The complex interactions among multiple ESs were determined by utilizing multiple methods: spearman correlation analysis, bivariate local spatial autocorrelation and K-means clustering. The linear or nonlinear relationships between ESs and drivers were discussed by generalized additive models (GAMs). The results showed that during 2000-2018, except for CF that exhibited no obvious change, all other ESs showed a decrease tendency. High ESs were clustered in mountains, while ESs in urban areas were lowest. At administrative districts scale, ESs were relatively higher in Beibei, Banan and Yubei, and drastically decreased in Jiangbei. Multiple ES hotspots demonstrated clear spatial heterogeneity, which were mainly composed of forestland and distributed in mountainous areas with high altitude and steep slope. The relationships between ES pairs were synergistic at the entire scale. However, at grid scale, the synergies were mainly concentrated in the high-high and low-low clusters, i.e., mountainous areas and urban central areas. Five ESs bundles presented the interactions among multiple ESs, which showed well correspondence with social-ecological conditions. GAMs indicated that forestland and grassland had positive impact on BI and CF. Additionally, SC was mainly determined by geomorphological factors, while WC were mainly influenced by precipitation. Furthermore, policy factors were confirmed to have a certain positive effect on ESs. This study provides credible references for ecosystem management and urban planning.

AB  - The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) is an eruptive forest pest that has caused a great deal of damage in the last decades because of increasing climatic extremes. In order to effectively manage outbreaks of this pest, it is important to predict where they will occur in the future. In this study we developed a predictive model of the sanitary felling of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) because of bark beetles. We used a time series of sanitary felling because of bark beetles from 1996 to 2020 in Slovenia. For the explanatory variables, we used soil, site, climate, geographic, and tree damage data from the previous year. The model showed that sanitary felling is negatively correlated with slope, soil depth, soil cation exchange capacity, and Standard Precipitation Index (less sanitary felling in wet years). On the other hand, soil base saturation percentage, temperature, sanitary felling because of bark beetles from the previous year, sanitary felling because of other abiotic factors from the previous year, and the amount of spruce were positively correlated with the sanitary felling of Norway spruce due to bark beetles. The model had an R-2 of 0.38. A prediction was performed for 2021 combining an occurrence model and a quantitative model. The model can be used to predict the amount of sanitary felling of Norway spruce due to bark beetles and to refine the risk map for the next year, which can be used for forest management planning and economic loss predictions.

AB  - BackgroundHow land use shapes biodiversity and functional trait composition of animal communities is an important question and frequently addressed. Land-use intensification is associated with changes in abiotic and biotic conditions including environmental homogenization and may act as an environmental filter to shape the composition of species communities. Here, we investigated the responses of land snail assemblages to land-use intensity and abiotic soil conditions (pH, soil moisture), and analyzed their trait composition (shell size, number of offspring, light preference, humidity preference, inundation tolerance, and drought resistance). We characterized the species' responses to land use to identify 'winners' (species that were more common on sites with high land-use intensity than expected) or 'losers' of land-use intensity (more common on plots with low land-use intensity) and their niche breadth. As a proxy for the environmental 'niche breadth' of each snail species, based on the conditions of the sites in which it occurred, we defined a 5-dimensional niche hypervolume. We then tested whether land-use responses and niches contribute to the species' potential vulnerability suggested by the Red List status.ResultsOur results confirmed that the trait composition of snail communities was significantly altered by land-use intensity and abiotic conditions in both forests and grasslands. While only 4% of the species that occurred in forests were significant losers of intensive forest management, the proportion of losers in grasslands was much higher (21%). However, the species' response to land-use intensity and soil conditions was largely independent of specific traits and the species' Red List status (vulnerability). Instead, vulnerability was only mirrored in the species' rarity and its niche hypervolume: threatened species were characterized by low occurrence in forests and low occurrence and abundance in grasslands and by a narrow niche quantified by land-use components and abiotic factors.ConclusionLand use and environmental responses of land snails were poorly predicted by specific traits or the species' vulnerability, suggesting that it is important to consider complementary risks and multiple niche dimensions.

AB  - Ecosystem engineer species can affect the assembly and maintenance of biological communities by altering local environmental conditions. Several palm tree species play this role in changing the surrounding environment mainly through the fall of entire rachis and the formation of a thick and homogeneous leaf litter layer beneath the canopy. However, their impact on soil animal communities remains unclear. In particular, soil organisms (e.g. ants) can be negatively affected by palm-driven local changes, since they are especially susceptible to leaf litter changes. Our objective was to test if the presence of palm trees reduces alpha and beta diversities of ant communities at taxonomic and morphometric levels. We also tested if palm tree understory mound (debris pile just below the canopy) area and population density reduce ant community alpha and beta diversities (at the taxonomic and morphometric levels) in tropical rainforests. To do so, we described taxonomic and morphometric diversity patterns of ant communities in a relictual landscape of the Atlantic Rainforest (northeastern Brazil) using Hill's numbers approach in two habitats: understory mounds surrounding the palm tree species Acrocomia intumescens, and forest understory without A. intumescens (non-palm understory). Our main findings were: (1) Taxonomic and morphometric alpha diversity were similar between A. intumescens understory mound and non-palm understory; (2) Ant communities in non-palm understory presented higher beta diversity than communities from A. intumescens understory mounds considering both rare species and morphometric traits; (3) A. intumescens understory mound area negatively affected common and dominant ant species; and (4) the interaction between understory mound area and the population density of A. intumescens affected dominant ant species in complex ways and the outcomes depend on the balance between both predictors. Our findings point to an important role of palm trees as ecosystem engineers in reducing ant biodiversity and changing the functional signature of human-modified tropical rainforests.

AB  - The diversity and composition of macrofaunal communities are important components to understand the mangrove ecosystem structures and functions. To understand the seasonal distribution of macroinfaunal community and diversity, this study was conducted from July 2019 to February 2020 in the intertidal mangrove forest of Punang-Sari-River estuary, Lawas, Sarawak. Sampling was carried out during post-monsoon, intermediate-September, pre-monsoon, and monsoon. It was observed that, the seasonal physico-chemical parameters were significantly (P < 0.05) different, including the temperature, salinity, rainfall, pore water nitrogenous compounds (NO2, NO3 and NH3-N), phosphate and micro minerals. A total of 39 infaunal macrobenthos taxa from 27 families were recorded while the mean abundance of infaunal macro benthos was found higher in monsoon (997.29 individuals/m2). The most abundant, the highest important species index and percentage contribution species was Bivalvia Eurytellina lineata (W. Turton, 1819) due to year-round favorable ecological condition. Seasonal faunal grouping suggested post-monsoon, intermediate-September and pre-monsoon were comparable in species and individual abundance. The Simpson, and Shannon indices were found significantly (P < 0.0001) higher in monsoon, while Margalef richness was found higher in pre-monsoon. The soil was sandy loam with major portion of sand, and positively correlated with sand and infaunal abundance in all seasons. The ANOSIM and SIMPER analysis suggested that the highest species abundance similarity was observed between post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, while the highest dissimilarity was observed between intermediate-September and pre-monsoon. The Canonical Correspondence Analysis results suggested, a number of species were influenced by ecological factors, for instance, salinity, soil pH, PO4, micro-macro minerals, water pH, and nitrogenous compounds. The relationship within benthic infaunal abundance in the mangrove ecosystem with their seasonality, ecological variables, and soil properties were established and addressed in this study.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water availability is an important driver of plant functional biogeography. Most studies focus on the effects of precipitation, and neglect the contribution of groundwater as a source when the water table depth (WTD) is accessible to roots. Previous studies suggested that shallow water tables select for acquisitive traits. These studies have mostly contrasted shallow vs. deep water tables, without considering a more fine-grained perspective within shallow water tables or the temporal WTD behavior. Here we tested whether the degree of variation in WTD translates into divergent modes of trait selection. We expect constantly shallow WTD leading to the selection of acquisitive traits, whilst high fluctuation of WTD would lead to tree communities with more conservative traits. We used community and trait data (wood density and leaf traits) from 25 1-ha forest monitoring plots spread over 600 km in central Amazonia, covering a gradient of shallow to intermediate (0-8 m deep) WTD along the Purus-Madeira interfluve. Wood density was measured directly in trunk cores (498 trees) and leaf traits (Specific Leaf Area, Leaf Dry Mass Content, Leaf Thickness) of >6,000 individuals were estimated with FT-NIR (Fourier-Transformed Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) spectral models calibrated with cross-Amazonian data. We observed a turnover of families, genera, and species along the gradient of temporal WTD fluctuation range. This taxonomic turnover was accompanied by a change in wood traits, with higher wood density associated to higher WTD fluctuation and higher climatic water deficit. Leaf traits, however, varied in the opposite direction than initially hypothesized, i.e., trees had more acquisitive traits toward intermediate WTD with higher fluctuation. Based on those results, we propose that the effect of WTD selection should be conceptualized in a quadratic form, going from water excess in very shallow WTD (<2 m, limiting condition due to anoxia, selecting conservative traits), to moist in intermediate WTD (between 2 and 5 m deep, favorable condition with constant water supply, selecting acquisitive traits), to water deficit in deep WTD (>5 m, limiting condition, with conservative traits again).

AB  - The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays important roles in response to abiotic and biotic stresses in plants. Pyrabactin resistance 1-like (PYR/PYL) proteins are well-known as ABA receptors, which are responsible for ABA signal transduction. Nevertheless, the characteristics of PYL genes from Liriodendron chinense, an endangered timber tree, remain unclear in coping with various stresses. In this study, five PYLs were identified from the genome of Liriodendron chinense by sequence alignment and conserved motif analysis, which revealed that these LcPYLs contain a conserved gate and latch motif for ABA binding. The LcPYL promoters possess a series of cis-acting elements involved in response to various hormone and abiotic stresses. Moreover, the transcriptome data of Liriodendron hybrid leaves reveal that LcPYL genes specifically transcript under different abiotic stresses; Lchi11622 transcription was induced by drought and cold treatment, and Lchi01385 and Lchi16997 transcription was upregulated under cold and hot stress, respectively. Meanwhile, the LcPYLs with high expression levels shown in the transcriptomes were also found to be upregulated in whole plants treated with the same stresses tested by qPCR. Moreover, under biotic stress caused by scale insect and whitefly, Liriodendron hybrid leaves exhibited a distinct phenotype including disease spots that are dark green in the middle and yellow on the margin; the qPCR results showed that the relative expression levels of Lchi13641 and Lchi11622 in infected leaves were upregulated by 1.76 and 3.75 folds relative to normal leaves, respectively. The subcellular localizations of these stress-responsive LcPYLs were also identified in protoplasts of Liriodendron hybrid. These results provide a foundation to elucidate the function of PYLs from this elite tree species and assist in understanding the molecular mechanism of Liriodendron hybrid in dealing with abiotic and biotic stresses. In future research, the detailed biological function of LcPYLs and the genetic redundancy between LcPYLs can be explored by gene overexpression and knockout based on this study.

AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi requires a triatomine insect vector for its life cycle, which can be complex in different enzootic scenarios, one of which is the unique transmission network in the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil. In Espirito Santo (ES) State, highly infected Triatoma vitticeps are frequently reported invading domi-ciles. However, triatomines were not found colonizing residences and mammals in the surrounding areas did not present T. cruzi infection. To date, the biotic and abiotic variables that modulate T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection in ES State are still unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the environmental variables that modulate their occurrence. Local thematic maps were generated for two response variables: T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection. The following explanatory variables were tested: climate (temperature, relative air humidity and rainfall), altitude elevation, mammalian species richness as well as soil and vegetation types. Spatiotemporal distribution patterns and correla-tion levels between response and explanatory variables were assessed through spatial statistics and map algebra modelling. The central and southern mesoregions presented higher T. vitticeps and T. cruzi distributions and can be considered transmission hotspots. The explanatory variables that can explain these phenomena were relative air humidity, average temperature, soil type, altitude ele-vation and mammalian species richness. Algebra map modelling demonstrated that central and southern mesoregions presented the environmental conditions needed for T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection. The consideration of environmental variables is essential for understanding the T. cruzi transmission cycle. Cartographic and statistical methodologies used in parasitology have been demonstrated to be reliable and enlightening tools that should be incorporated routinely to expand the understanding of vector-borne parasite transmission.

AB  - Yunnan Province in southwest China is characterized by a vast area, diverse climate types, rich ecosystem types, and unique biodiversity resources. With consideration of global climate change, there is an urgent need to evaluate the response of vegetation to drought in Yunnan. This study utilized the MOD13A3, MOD17A2, and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 remote sensing products. The TRMM 3B43 downscaled monthly precipitation data were used to calculate the tropical rainfall condition index (TRCI) for Yunnan. The TRCI was used as a drought index, and the temporal and spatial changes in TRCI, gross primary productivity (GPP), and vegetation condition index (VCI) from 2009 to 2018 were explored. The response of vegetation to drought was evaluated under different time scales and varying land-use types. The results showed that during 2009-2018, (1) at an annual scale, the drought in Yunnan showed a weakening trend, and at a spatial scale, the drought showed a weakening trend from northwest to southeast. This weakening trend was more noticeable for cultivated land than for forest, grassland, and other land-use types. (2) GPP and VCI showed overall increasing trends at an annual scale, indicating gradual improvements in the GPP of vegetation and vegetation status, whereas the summer vegetation index showed a decreasing trend. (3) Although both the GPP and the growth state of vegetation were affected by drought, the responses of GPP and VCI to drought differed under different temporal scales and different land-use types. The responses of GPP and VCI to drought during spring were greater than those over other seasons, and the response of VCI to drought was more sensitive than that of GPP. Drought had a high impact on the GPP and vegetation growth of cultivated land and grassland with shallow root systems, whereas the impact of drought on forest was relatively stable.

AB  - Understanding the effects of forest-to-agriculture conversion on microbial diversity has been a major goal in soil ecological studies. However, linking community assembly to the ruling ecological processes at local and regional scales remains challenging. Here, we evaluated bacterial community assembly patterns and the ecological processes governing niche specialization in a gradient of geography, seasonality, and land-use change, totaling 324 soil samples, 43 habitat characteristics (abiotic factors), and 16 metabolic and co-occurrence patterns (biotic factors), in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, a subtropical biome recognized as one the world's largest and most threatened hotspots of biodiversity. Pairwise beta diversities were lower in pastures than in forest and no-till soils. Pasture communities showed a predominantly neutral model, regarding stochastic processes, with moderate dispersion, leading to biotic homogenization. Most no-till and forest microbial communities followed a niche-based model, with low rates of dispersal and weak homogenizing selection, indicating niche specialization or variable selection. Historical and evolutionary contingencies, as represented by soil type, season, and dispersal limitation were the main drivers of microbial assembly and processes at the local scale, markedly correlated with the occurrence of endemic microbes. Our results indicate that the patterns of assembly and their governing processes are dependent on the niche occupancy of the taxa evaluated (generalists or specialists). They are also more correlated with historical and evolutionary contingencies and the interactions among taxa (i.e., co-occurrence patterns) than the land-use change itself.

AB  - Plants adapted to different habitats exhibit differences in functional traits and these characteristics are influenced by soil properties. We tested the hypothesis that soil resource availability influences the functional traits of plants, affecting therefore herbivory levels. We examined three Byrsonima plant species with different life forms that occurred across a distinct edaphic habitat along the Doce River Basin, South-eastern Brazil. We characterized habitats according to soil nutrient concentration and measured functional characteristics of crown architecture, leaf nutrients, sclerophylly, leaf area and leaf density. In addition, we evaluated how these variables influenced herbivory levels of congeneric plants. Our data show that species along a gradient of soil nutrients have functional characteristics influenced by habitat, which in turn affect herbivory levels. By comparing congeners with different life forms found along a stress-gradient of continuous habitats, we describe a corresponding gradient of plant functional traits and tissue consumption by herbivorous insects.

AB  - Advancing extensive cattle production is a major threat to biodiversity conservation in Amazonia. The dominant vegetation cover has a drastic impact on soil microbial communities, affecting their composition, structure, and ecological services. Herein, we explored relationships between land-use, soil types, and forest floor compartments on the prokaryotic metacommunity structuring in Western Amazonia. Soil samples were taken in sites under high anthropogenic pressure and distributed along a +/- 800 km gradient. Additionally, the litter and a root layer, characteristic of the forest environment, were sampled. DNA was extracted, and metacommunity composition and structure were assessed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Prokaryotic metacommunities in the bulk soil were strongly affected by pH, base and aluminum saturation, Ca + Mg concentration, the sum of bases, and silt percentage, due to land-use management and natural differences among the soil types. Higher alpha, beta, and gamma diversities were observed in sites with higher soil pH and fertility, such as pasture soils or fertile soils of the state of Acre. When taking litter and root layer communities into account, the beta diversity was significantly higher in the forest floor than in pasture bulk soil for all study regions. Our results show that the forest floor's prokaryotic metacommunity performs a spatial turnover hitherto underestimated to the regional scale of diversity.

AB  - Open-cast mining in tropical forests causes negative impacts on biodiversity and carbon storage. Postmining reclamation is therefore imposed to recover the vegetation despite the lack of understanding which indicators can be used to monitor the progress of succession. This study proposes an integrated framework to assess the trajectory of vegetation succession in coal mining site in East Kalimantan, Borneo. We combine the indicators of floristic diversity of naturally growing terrestrial and epiphytic plants, survival and growth of enrichment planting of native plants, above-ground carbon stock of pioneer trees, and the measurements on micro-climate and soil conditions. We compare some indicators across the 9-year-old and 17-year-old reclaimed sites and the premining sites. The results showed that naturally growing vegetation at the reclaimed sites was at the early to midsuccession stages, with biodiversity indicators much lower than those at the premining areas, implying the necessity of native species planting. During a six-month monitoring, the enrichment planting of native species had high rates of survival and growth. Surprisingly, the above-ground carbon at the two reclamation sites were higher, up to six times larger, than that at the premining sites. While the micro-climates had been improved, the soils in the reclaimed sites were still in poor conditions. Our findings suggest that using single parameter to monitor the trajectory of vegetation succession in postmining reclamation can be biased, and integrating several monitoring measures would provide a much better assessment.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of allelopathy and resource availability is critical for protecting rare and endangered species, biodiversity, and ecosystems. We treated 20 major plant species with three concentrations of an aqueous extract of Dacrydium pierrei Hickel litter and different irrigation and nutrients to compare the relative importance of allelopathy and resource availability on roots, stem growth, and seed germination, using bioassays. The results showed that the height, ground diameter, and aboveground biomass of individuals increased more quickly in the early stage, and the rate of increase tended to slow down in the later stages. The allelopathy was species specific (inhibitory, neutral, or promotive), and the survival rate and growth rate of saplings changed significantly along a resource treatment gradient (P < 0.05), indicating that the native species diversity was reduced by lower or higher resource availability in natural forests. The effect of allelopathy on trees was relatively weak during the treatments, and that of resource availability was relatively strong. Resource availability is relatively more important than allelopathy in mediating the reduction in plant biodiversity. Therefore, water and nutrient availability and the species and number of allelochemicals released by plants have substantial influences on the survival and growth of plant species in a natural Dacrydium forest.

AB  - 1. Most studies focused on the above-ground diversity on leaf litter decomposition and soil respiration in tropical ecosystems, however, the mechanism understanding of root diversity on decomposition is still unclear.2. We selected the fine-roots of 21 dominant tree species from a tropical rainforest in Xishuangbannan, China, then conducted a 360-day and well-replicated (21 replications) incubation decomposition experiment with a 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 species gradient of root diversity. The fine-root mass loss, CO2 release, and their potential drivers were analysed.3. The results showed that as fine-root diversity increased, soil properties, microbial diversity and fungal biomass changed nonlinearly, leading to higher litter mass loss and soil CO2 release in the moderate diversity with 9, 12 and 15 species mixtures. Non-additive effect analysis also indicated that synergistic effects were greater in these three mixtures than others on soil CO(2 )release and litter mass loss. The indirect effects of soil properties and microbial communities were larger than the direct effect of fine-root diversity.4. Our findings suggest that fine-root diversity has nonlinear relationships with litter decomposition and soil CO2 release in tropical forests, thus highlighting the importance of plant diversity due to its role in the carbon cycle under global change scenario.

AB  - Brazil has 166 million hectares of pastures, 58.8% (97.6 million hectares) of which are in some degree of degradation. Besides the low animal support capacity and vegetative yield, degraded pastures also contribute significantly to soil carbon losses, through CO2 emission. This study aimed to understand the temporal dynamics of atmospheric CO2 in contrast between degraded pastures (DP) and managed pastures (MP) in the Cerrado Brazil biome. Using the Pasture Atlas and 6-year time series, the variables were collected under the pasture classes: column-average concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (xCO2), Soil Carbon Stock (SCS), as well as Solar-induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) as vegetative characteristics, and Land Surface Temperature Amplitude (LST Amplitude) and Precipitation as climatic aspects. Except for xCO2, MP was significantly different from DP with higher SIF, NDVI, LAI, Precipitation, and SCS, but smaller LST Amplitude. The hypothesis test (Student t-test p < 0.05) results indicate higher Precipitation and SCS in MP when compared to DP due to its positive effect of higher vegetative values. Linear regression and Pearson's correlation analysis indicate that xCO2 negatively relates to the precipitation and vegetative variables (NDVI, LAI, and SIF), but positively with LST Amplitude and SCS. Soil carbon stock obtained a significant xCO2 relationship (p < 0.001) only in the DP, suggesting that the environmental stress experienced by degraded pastures impacts soil carbon losses as a source of CO2. Therefore, this study concludes that DP with carbon stored in the soil is the main source of CO2 for the atmosphere when compared to MP. So, if the necessary care is not taken, the organic carbon from these degraded pastures will be lost to the atmosphere as CO2. These findings may favor nature-based solutions indicating that proper pasture management is an important aspect to mitigate emissions and improving soil carbon content helping to mitigate atmospheric CO2.

AB  - AimsPlants and soils are key factors in maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). Yet, it remains unclear how climate factors regulate the EMF through soil properties and plant diversity of different plant functional groups in primary dark coniferous forests of subalpine regions.MethodsNine functional indicators related to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus cycling and plant productivity, four leaf functional traits, mean annual precipitation (MAP) and mean annual temperature (MAT) were collected from 50 primary dark coniferous forests in ten sites on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The EMF was calculated using two approaches. The averaging approach involves converting and averaging the functional indicators, and the multiple threshold approach quantifies the number of functions across different thresholds.ResultsMAP promoted EMF. Soil water content and shrub species richness had a significant positive effect on EMF, whereas herb species richness had a negative effect. Functional diversity and specific leaf area of tree species rather than richness had a significant positive effect on EMF, indicating the increase in functional traits was beneficial to EMF. Climatic factors could directly or indirectly affect EMF through species richness, functional diversity, and soil abiotic factors.ConclusionsThe effects of species richness on EMF varied among different plant functional groups, possibly related to different mechanisms, and highlighted the role of functional diversity in maintaining EMF. Spatial variation in climate could modify soil properties and plant diversity, further affecting EMF in primary dark coniferous forests. Hence, these findings should be considered in future predictions of how a changing climate could affect EMF.

AB  - Soils form the skin of the Earth's surface, regulating water and biogeochemical cycles and generating production of food, timber, and textiles around the world. Changes in soil and its ability to perform a range of processes have important implications for Earth system function, especially in the critical zone (CZ)-the area that extends from the top of the canopy to the bottom of groundwater and that harbors most of Earth's biosphere. A key aspect of the way soil functions results from its structure, defined as the size, shape, and arrangement of soil particles and pores. The network of pores provides storage space for at least a quarter of Earth's biodiversity, while the abundance, size and connectivity of the pore space regulates fluxes of heat, water, nutrients and gases that define the physical and chemical environment. Here we review the nature of soil structure, focusing on its co-evolution with the plants and microbes that live within the soil, and the degree to which these processes have been incorporated into flow and transport models. Though it is well known that soil structure can change with wetting and drying events, often oscillating seasonally, the dynamic nature of soil structure that we discuss is a systematic shift that results in changes in its hydro-bio-geochemical function over decades to centuries, timescales over which major changes in carbon and nutrient cycles have been observed in the Anthropocene. We argue that the variable nature of soil structure, and its dynamics, need to be better understood and captured by land surface and ecosystem models, which currently describe soil structure as static. We further argue that modelers and empiricists both are well-poised to quantify and incorporate these dynamics into their studies. From these efforts, four fundamental questions emerge: 1) How do rates of soil aggregate formation and collapse, and their overall arrangements, interact in the Anthropocene to regulate CZ functioning from soil particle to continental scales? 2) How do alterations in rooting-depth distributions in the Anthropocene influence pore structure to control hydrological partitioning, biogeochemical transformations and fluxes, exchanges of energy and carbon with the atmosphere and climate, regolith weathering, and thus regulation of CZ functioning? 3) How does changing microbial functioning in a high CO2, warmer world with shifting precipitation patterns influence soil organic carbon dynamics and void-aggregate profile dynamics? 4) How deeply does human influence in the Anthropocene propagate into the subsurface, how does this depth relate to profile structure, and how does this alter the rate at which the CZ develops? The United Nations has recently recognized that 33% of the Earth's soils are already degraded and over 90% could become degraded by 2050. This recognition highlights the importance of addressing these proposed questions, which will promote a predictive understanding of soil structure.

AB  - Against the background of the ongoing climate change, forest science and Central-European forest management need information about tree species that are suitable of forming resistant and resilient multispecific and multipurpose forest stands. Non-native species are also considered for this purpose. One of these species may be the Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), which has been introduced from western North America to Europe in the 19th century. The aim of this review is to compile recent scientific results that are relevant in the context of the use of the Douglas fir in future Central-European forestry to create a foundation for science-based decisionmaking, and to formulate future research tasks on that basis. Due to its high growth rates and low susceptibility to needle cast fungi, the Douglas fir's coastal variety (P. menziesii var. menziesii, syn.: var. viridis) is being preferred in Central-European silviculture. It is competitively superior to all indigenous Central-European forest tree species due to rapid height growth and efficient shading of competing plants; high drought tolerance, water use efficiency and resilience after drought stress; and efficient water and nutrient uptake and high nutrient use efficiency. In Central Europe, the Douglas fir is currently less threatened by pests and pathogens than are the indigenous Norway spruce and Scots pine. Its litter is better decomposable compared to native conifers, but increased nitrification, especially at sites with former agricultural use or under anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, or lower nitrate uptake rates due to lower nitrogen demand of the species can result in enhanced soil acidification, aluminum mobilization and leaching of nitrate, "base" cations and aluminum compounds. Mixtures of Douglas fir and native trees may be particularly effective in sequestrating carbon and nitrogen in the soil. Negative effects of the Douglas fir on the plant diversity of a given community seem to be small or even non-existent, but its interactions with the fauna is more ambiguous. The majority of nature conservation organizations recommend avoiding Douglas-fir monocultures and restricting the fraction of Douglas-fir admixtures to stands of native tree species to 30% at maximum in considering current regulations for nature protection. Future research tasks comprise monitoring of the Douglas-fir provenances in cultivation and of introduced pests and pathogens, investigations of responses to consecutive and combined stress factors and of the species' invasiveness at dry sites as well as comparative long-term studies on interactions with animal communities and on matter flux and turnover in the ecosystems.

AB  - We estimated climate niche shifts and threat levels under various climate change scenarios for Vaccinium myrtillus L. and V. vitis-idaea L. We developed the MaxEnt species distribution models, and predicted future climatic optima for climate change scenarios for 2041-2060 and 2061-2080. The precipitation of the warmest quarter was the most important factor shaping the climatic niches of the studied species. We predicted the largest shifts in climate niches from the present to the 2040-2060 period, with the most pessimistic scenario predicting significant range losses for both species, mainly in Western Europe. Under the most optimistic SSP126 scenario, both species will lose 39 % of their climatic niche for both periods. In the worst-case scenario (SSP585) for 2061-2080, climatic niche contraction will cover 47 % and 39 % of the current climatic niche for V. myrtillus and V. vitis-idaea, respectively. The predicted changes in species distribution could have far-reaching consequences for temperate and boreal forests due to their crucial biocenotic role in forest ecosystems, high potential for carbon sequestration, and prevention of soil erosion. Furthermore, the changes would likely affect the economic potential regarding fruit production and culturally relevant uses of different parts of the plants, mainly fruits.

AB  - Addressing food security in high mountains is a multidimensional conundrum because of complex climate patterns and environmental attributes. These conditions affect water supplies, biodiversity, droughts, and other hazards. The climate change-land degradation nexus, although it is difficult to disentangle, poses formidable challenges. Isolated mountain villages, coupled with poverty, a strained subsistence existence, conflict, and marginal lands make the residents vulnerable to malnutrition, stunting, and food access. Because the arable land is mostly in confined valleys, food production is insufficient. The soils are typically infertile, with little organic matter; on hillslopes, thin soil and rock cover, coupled with short growing seasons, restrict crop production. High-elevation pastures are overgrazed, and the natural hazard impacts on food security are often overlooked. We examine food security through these multifaceted stressors, instead of merely focusing on production and distribution, and present an integrated approach to assess natural and anthropogenic stressors and feedback loops affecting food security linked to planning, mitigation, and coping strategies.

AB  - Macrofungi are vital components of any forest ecosystem, performing different roles crucial to ecosystem functioning. Macrofungi play effective roles in ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling. Ectomycorrhizal fungi and plant symbionts work together to accumulate, use and transfer essential nutrients, especially in nitrogen/phosphoruslimited environments. Pathogenic and predatory macrofungi exploit other resources such as plants and animals to obtain nutrients needed for growth. These groups of macrofungi also contribute to the species diversity of forest ecosystems. Saprotrophic macrofungi degrade available organic matter from dead plants and soil organic matter. Macrofungi also play an important role in carbon sequestration in the forest underground as well as in soil formation. Macrofungi remediate pollutants in the environment via extracellular enzymes. Mycelial networks that connect macrofungi to their symbiotic hosts and substrates enable most of these functions. Mycelial networks facilitate the absorption and transport of nutrients as well as the secretion of enzymes and other organic substances. Spore-producing bodies of macrofungi serve as a food source for wildlife. Fungal spores can act as aerosols in rain formation. All of these functions of macrofungi are necessary for maintaining biodiversity and healthy forest ecosystems. However, the contributions of macrofungi to ecosystem processes are often taken for granted or not fully recognized, offering key services that are easily overlooked in planning processes and policymaking. The present review summarizes the major roles of macrofungi in ecosystem functioning

AB  - The survival of agroforestry species in Senegal is threatened by climate change. Hence, it has become important to identify the most endangered species for prioritising conservation efforts. This study aimed to assess the impact of climate change on the distribution of three key agroforestry species in Senegal: Faidherbia albida, Balanites aegyptiaca, and Cordyla pinnata. To predict their habitat suitability, we evaluated the performance of five algorithms: Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Generalised Linear Models, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machines. Two shared socio-economic pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) were used over four time slices (2041-2060, 2061-2080, and 2081-2100). The dataset included 19 bioclimatic and 12 soil variables, with 5342 species occurrences collected from fieldwork and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility website. The main variables influencing the species distribution were selected based on collinearity, jackknife tests, and their contribution. The results revealed that the Random Forest outperformed other models in terms of performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.95 for all species. The distribution of F. albida and C. pinnata was mainly influenced by precipitation related variables, while that of B. aegyptiaca was mainly influenced by both precipitation and temperature related variables. The current habitat range of F. albida, C. pinnata, and B. aegyptiaca represents 45% (88,515.63 km(2)), 14.43% (28,381.55 km(2)) and 29.73% (58,479.53 km(2)) of the total area of Senegal, respectively. However, the models showed a decrease in the habitat range of C. pinnata, regardless of the scenario or time horizon. The distribution of F. albida is predicted to increase under SSP2-4.5 and decrease under SSP5-8.5. In contrast, B. aegyptiaca is predicted to be more resilient to climate change as its habitat suitability would expand under both scenarios. Hence, conservation efforts should prioritise C. pinnata and, to a lesser extent, F. albida.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of altitude, precipitation, and soil conditions on species richness (SR), phylogenetic diversity (PD), and functional diversity (FD) standardized effect sizes in subtropical Brazilian Atlantic Forest tree communities. We considered specific trait information (FDs) for FD, reflecting recent adaptive evolution, contrasting with deeper phylogenetic constraints in FD. Three functional traits (leaf area-LA, wood density-WD, and seed mass-SM) were examined for their response to these gradients. Generalized least squares models with environmental variables as predictors and diversity metrics as response variables were used, and a fourth-corner correlation test explored trait-environmental relationships. SR decreased with altitude, while PD increased, indicating niche convergence at higher altitudes. Leaf area and seed mass diversity also decreased with altitude. For LA, both FD and FDs were significant, reflecting filtering processes influenced by phylogenetic inheritance and recent trait evolution. For SM, only the specific trait structure responded to altitude. LA and SM showed significant trait-environmental relationships, with smaller-leaved and lighter-seeded species dominant at higher altitudes. Soil gradients affect diversity. Fertile soils have a wider range of LA, indicating coexistence of species with different nutrient acquisition strategies. WD variation is lower for FDs. SM diversity has different relationships with soil fertility for FDs and FD, suggesting phylogeny influences trait variation. Soil pH influences WD and LA under acidic soils, with deeper phylogenetic constraints (FD). Environmental factors impact tree communities, with evidence of trait variation constraints driven by conditions and resources. Subtropical Atlantic forests' tree assemblies are mainly influenced by altitude, pH, and soil fertility, selecting fewer species and narrower trait spectra under specific conditions (e.g., higher altitudes, pH). Functional diversity patterns reflect both phylogenetic and recent evolution constraints, with varying strength across traits and conditions. These findings highlight the intricate processes shaping long-lived species assembly across diverse environments in the Southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest.

AB  - Objective: Our objective was to identify suitable areas for ecological cattle production and conservation areas for jaguar and puma populations.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted the superpositioning of raster and vector maps and the reclassification from the combination of spatial and alphanumeric data integrated into an analytical geographic information system. The levels of aptitude were classified, taking into consideration of horizontal and vertical dissection of the relief, altitude, slope, productive potential per taxonomic unit of soil, temperature, precipitation, access to water sources, vegetation and land use, the National Cattle Registry, and distances to roads and human settlements.
   Results and Discussion: The results indicated that approximately 469 ha showed high potential, 206,386 ha showed medium potential, and 1,794,357 showed low potential for cattle farming. The potential areas identified for jaguar conservation were 2,713 km(2), and those for puma conservation were 2,446 km(2).
   Applications: In Mexico, primarily in the State of Guerrero, forests and scrublands fulfill the summer pasture (agostadero) role in ejidos for extensive cattle production, and the introduction of improved grasses displaces native vegetation without serving as forage for wild ungulates, affecting felines, which turn to cattle for food. Ecological farming is an alternative that promotes biodiversity, respecting the role and functions of the soil.

AB  - At the global level, ecological restoration is becoming increasingly important due to the degraded conditions of ecosystems, which requires urgent efforts to recover these ecosystems and reestablish ecosystem services and forest biodiversity. However, there is a scarcity of studies evaluating the effects of forest restoration programs on soil properties and ecohydrological functioning of tropical ecosystems, which are in rapid decline. This research aims to evaluate ecohydrological processes in two low montane moist forest (bh-MB) watersheds subjected to ecological restoration (El Silencio and Montanita), compared to one with pastures (Pastos), and to characterize the variables influencing these processes in emerging ecosystems. In each watershed, climatic variables were monitored, and the physical, hydraulic and organic matter properties of the soil were measured, along with ecohydrological variables. The results indicate that watersheds under the restoration program exhibit a tendency to recover the initial conditions of soil properties, favoring the regulation of summer flows and reducing storm flows. In contrast, the pasture watershed shows a tendency towards degraded soils. The natural regeneration process of the forest in areas dedicated to extensive cattle raising contributes to improving the physical conditions of the soil. This improvement, in turn, facilitates water recharge to the aquifers and sustains the base flow during periods of low precipitation.

AB  - Ecosystem stability is the interaction result of species diversity, environmental conditions and external disturbances, the research on diversity and stability of plant community and their relationship with environmental factors is the prerequisite of establishing a self-organized ecosystem with adaptability and resilience. Taking Nangqian County in the source region of Lancang River as study area, this paper empirically analyzed the influence and mechanism of plant diversity and environmental factors on community stability through Spearman correlation test, regression analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA), so as to provide scientific basis for ecological restoration and construction of stable plant community. The results showed that the descending order of community stability was N-8 > N-3 > N-5 > N-4 > N-2 > N-9 > N-6 > N-7 > N-1 (N-1-N-9 respectively represent the nine sampling sites selected in this study). Community stability index (S) tended to decrease first and then increase with the increase of Species richness index (R) and Pielou evenness index (J), but had no significant correlation with Simpson dominance index (D) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H). Plant diversity mainly affected stability through mechanism channels such as improving performance effect, species evenness and interspecific competition. Topsoil organic carbon (T_OC), pH (T_PH) and sodicity (T_ESP) had important influence on community stability. Temperature (TEMP) and precipitation (PRCP) influenced the distribution pattern of plant communities, while topographic factors including elevation (ELEV), slope (SLOPE) and aspect (ASPECT) affected mean value of species abundance (mu) and Species richness index (R) through solar radiation intensity, temperature, precipitation and soil conditions. In the source regions of Lancang River and other similar areas, ecological restoration should pay attention to the adaptation of species to moisture, heat and soil conditions, give full play to the important role of dominant species in maintaining stability, take into account species evenness and weaken intensity of interspecific competition while increasing diversity.

AB  - Forest site (FS) and meteorological conditions are recognized as the main factors affecting tree growth and whole-stand sustainability. This study aims to detect the combined effects of FS and meteorological conditions on tree ring formation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), the most common tree species in Lithuania and hemi-boreal forests of northeastern Europe. We used data on stand structure and productivity from the Lithuanian National Forest Inventory (NFI) and stem radial increment series of dominating trees during the period 1993-2012 collected since 2013. Pine stem basal area increment (BAI) was chosen as the response variable, while temperature in March (degrees C) and precipitation in June (mm) were used as predictor variables, as they best express the effect of climate change on Lithuanian forests. We simulated the effects on dominating pine annual increment of deciduous tree species, mainly Betula sp. and the level of soil moisture and fertility, accounting in addition for the random effects of NFI network tract, plot direction, and tree number. A nonlinear mixed-effects model explained up to 68% of the variation in the BAI of pine trees. The annual pine trees BAI increased with the increase in the proportion of deciduous trees in pine stands. Increases in temperature and precipitation in considered months reinforced this positive effect on pine BAI, especially in mature pine stands in temporarily waterlogged meso-eutrophic FSs on mineral soils. A negative effect of deciduous trees on pine stem increment was observed only in nutrient-rich eutrophic and drained peatland FSs. Forestry treatments directed towards the increase in deciduous tree proportion in the most common normal or temporarily waterlogged meso-eutrophic and oligotrophic pine stands might increase the biodiversity and productivity of pine stands, and their sustainability in future climate change scenarios.

AB  - Background: In the last decades, Southeast Asia has experienced massive conversion of rainforest into rubber and oil palm monoculture plantations. The effects of this land-use change on canopy arthropods are still largely unknown. Arboreal Collembola are among the most abundant canopy arthropods in tropical forests, potentially forming a major component of the canopy food web by contributing to the decomposition of arboreal litter and being an important prey for canopy arthropod predators. We investigated abundance, richness, and community composition of, as well as the influence of a series of environmental factors on, canopy Collembola communities in four land-use systems in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia: (1) lowland rainforest, (2) jungle rubber (rubber agroforest), and monoculture plantations of (3) rubber and (4) oil palm. Results: Using canopy fogging in 32 research plots in both the dry and rainy seasons in 2013, we collected 77,104 specimens belonging to 68 (morpho) species. Generally, Collembola communities were dominated by few species including two species of the genus Salina (Paronellidae; 34% of total individuals) and two species of Lepidocyrtinae (Entomobryidae; 20%). The abundance of Collembola in lowland rainforest (53.4 +/- 30.7 ind. m(-2)) was more than five times higher than in rubber plantations, and more than ten times higher than in oil palm plantations; abundances in jungle rubber were intermediate. Collembola species richness was highest in rainforest (18.06 +/- 3.60 species) and jungle rubber (16.88 +/- 2.33 species), more than twice that in rubber or oil palm. Collembola community composition was similar in rainforest and jungle rubber, but different from monoculture plantations which had similar Collembola community composition to each other. The environmental factors governing community composition differed between the land-use systems and varied between seasons. Conclusions: Overall, this is the first in-depth report on the structure of arboreal Collembola communities in lowland rainforest and agricultural replacement systems in Southeast Asia. The results highlight the potentially major consequences of land-use change for the functioning of arboreal arthropod food webs.

AB  - This study was conducted to analyze the variation of soil multifunctionality (SMF) along elevation and the driving factors in the Altun Shan. Soil samples (0-10 cm) were collected from 15 sites (H01 to H15) at every 200 m elevation interval, covering a total range from 900 m to 3500 m above mean sea level. We investigated climate factors (mean annual temperature, MAT; mean annual precipitation, MAP), soil environment (soil water content, electrical conductance, and pH), vegetation factors, and elevation to determine which of them are the main driving factors of the spatial variability of SMF in the Altun Shan. We explored the best-fit model of SMF along the changes in elevation using a structural equation model, performed variance partitioning analysis (VPA) on SMF with the "varpart" function to explain the relative contribution of various environmental factors to SMF changes, and used a random forest model for relative importance analysis. The results showed that SMF in the Altun Shan significantly increased with elevation in a linear trend. The main driver of changes in SMF was found to be MAP. Although the rise in elevation did not have a significant direct effect on changes in SMF, it could indirectly affect SMF by significantly influencing MAP, pH, MAT, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). When considering climate, soil environment, and vegetation factors together, they explained 76% of the variation in SMF. The largest contribution to the variation in SMF was attributed to the independent effect of climate (0.31) and its interactive effect with soil (0.30). The relative importance of MAP on SMF changes was found to be the greatest. It is indicated that changes in SMF are caused by the combined effect of multiple environmental conditions. These findings are essential for understanding the spatial variability and drivers of SMF in dryland mountain ecosystems, especially concerning the function of mountain ecosystems in the context of global climatic changes.

AB  - As the most remote archipelago in the world, the Hawaiian Islands are home to a highly endemic and disharmonic biota that has fascinated biologists for centuries. Forests are the dominant terrestrial biome in Hawai'i, spanning complex, heterogeneous climates across substrates that vary tremendously in age, soil structure, and nutrient availability. Species richness is low in Hawaiian forests compared to other tropical forests, as a consequence of dispersal limitation from continents and adaptive radiations in only some lineages, and forests are dominated by the widespread Metrosideros species complex. Low species richness provides a relatively tractable model system for studies of community assembly, local adaptation, and species interactions. Moreover, Hawaiian forests provide insights into predicted patterns of evolution on islands, revealing that while some evidence supports "island syndromes," there are exceptions to them all. For example, Hawaiian plants are not as a whole less defended against herbivores, less dispersible, more conservative in resource use, or more slowgrowing than their continental relatives. Clearly, more work is needed to understand the drivers, sources, and constraints on phenotypic variation among Hawaiian species, including both widespread and rare species, and to understand the role of this variation for ecological and evolutionary processes, which will further contribute to conservation of this unique biota. Today, Hawaiian forests are among the most threatened globally. Resource management failures - the proliferation of non-native species in particular - have led to devastating declines in native taxa and resulted in dominance by novel species assemblages. Conservation and restoration of Hawaiian forests now rely on managing threats including climate change, ongoing species introductions, novel pathogens, lost mutualists, and altered ecosystem dynamics through the use of diverse tools and strategies grounded in basic ecological, evolutionary, and biocultural principles. The future of Hawaiian forests thus depends on the synthesis of ecological and evolutionary research, which will continue to inform future conservation and restoration practices.

AB  - The species interactions can be affected by environmental stress; however, how such change affects the plant species richness-biomass relationship is still unclear. Here, experimental plant communities with species richness levels of 1, 2, 4, and 8 were assembled and subjected to a simulated acid rain (SAR) intensity gradient (pH 7.0, 4.5 and 2.5). The species richness-biomass relationship was investigated and the absolute growth rate and survival rate were measured under each SAR intensity. With the increasing SAR intensity, the species rich-ness-biomass relationships changed from positive to negative as a result of a shift in the biodiversity effects from positive to negative selection. Under a SAR intensity of pH 7.0, the absolute growth rate determined the biomass ratio of species in the mixtures. Mixtures that included Sedum lineare (with rapid growth) had a lower soil total nitrogen (TN), soil total phosphorus (TP), and greater aboveground biomass than mixtures that did not include the species, which led to a positive selection effect. Under a SAR intensity of pH 2.5, the survival rate determined the biomass ratio of species in the mixtures. Mixtures that included Sedum emarginatum and Phedimus spurius (with high survival rates) had less aboveground biomass than mixtures that did not include them, which led to a negative selection effect. Our results indicated that the mechanism by which a plant gains competitive superi-ority (i.e., a shift from rapid growth to a high survival rate) in response to environmental stress will affect the biodiversity effect. Considering future climate change scenarios, we suggest that changes in the competition mechanism should be integrated into future studies of the relationship between plant diversity and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Neutral models in ecology assume that all species are demographically equivalent, such that their abundances differ ultimately because of demographic stochasticity rather than selection. In spite of their simplicity, neutral models have been found to accurately reproduce static patterns of biodiversity for diverse communities. However, the same neutral models have been found to exhibit species abundance dynamics that are far too slow compared to reality, resulting in poor fits to temporally dynamic patterns of biodiversity. Here, we show that one of the root causes of these slow dynamics is the additional assumption that a community has reached an equilibrium with a fixed community size, with species that have a net growth rate close to zero. We removed this additional assumption by constructing and analyzing a neutral model with an expected community size that can change over time and is not necessarily at equilibrium, which thus allows the historical formation of a community to be represented explicitly. Our analysis demonstrated that for the general scenario where a small community rapidly grows in size to a carrying capacity, representing recovery from ecological disturbance or assembly of a new community, the model produced much larger changes in species abundances and much shorter species ages than a neutral model at an equilibrium with fixed community size. In addition, the species abundance distribution was biphasic with a subset of abundant species arising from a founder effect. We confirmed these new results in applications of the new model to the specific scenario of recovery of the Amazon tree community after the endCretaceous bolide impact, which involved periods of increasing and decreasing community size. We conclude that incorporating transient dynamics in neutral models improves realism by allowing explicit consideration of how a community is formed over realistic time-scales.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mountain landscapes are highly heterogeneous due to topography, notably positions along slope and slope shapes, which control ecosystem mechanisms. We hypothesized that tree dieback is controlled by topography, selecting productive and less diverse communities in lower slopes, and stress-resistant and more diverse communities on upper slopes. Understanding how this heterogeneity drives vegetation patterns should provide benchmarks for ecosystem management of mountain forest dominated by Quercus brantii. Woody communities were sampled along convex vs concave topography (i.e., ridge vs talweg), and with measurements of tree dieback severity, environmental variables (litter depth, soil quality, rock outcrop), stand structure (canopy cover, mistletoe infestation, tree diameter and height, diameter and height differentiations, oaks' number from sproutclumps or seed-origin), and biodiversity. Slope position was the most significant driver that affected all variables, excepted evenness. Dieback severity was higher on slope shoulders and summits, and lower in lower slopes where trees were the most productive: taller, larger, more homogeneous, and mostly seed-origin. Catena shape affected the diversity and dieback severity, both higher in talwegs, but had no effect on environmental variables and little on stand structure. Outputs indicate that the higher diversity of woody plants is on upper slopes supporting stress-resistant community associated with more severe dieback and mistletoe infection probably because frugivore birds attracted by the shrubs' fruits. Semi-arid forest management must consider the shapedslope ecosystem heterogeneity by preserving ridges that are more susceptible to tree dieback, and naturally support biodiversity. Restoration measures on lower fertile slopes could be carried out by oak planting or seedlings under the cover of shrubs to counter dieback effects and environmental stresses. In addition, forestry measures can be taken in lower positions for the conversion of coppice to high oak forest to potentially consider a moderate forestry.

AB  - Introduction: To achieve effective conservation objectives, it is crucial to map biodiversity patterns and hotspots while considering multiple influencing factors. However, focusing solely on biodiversity hotspots is inadequate for species conservation on a landscape scale. This emphasizes the importance of integrating hotspots with the home ranges of species to identify priority conservation areas.Methods: Compiling the vegetation data with environmental and anthropogenic disturbance data collected from kilometer-grid plots in Bawangling Nature Reserve, Hainan, China, we analyzed the spatial distribution of plant diversity (species richness and Shannon-Wiener index), as well as the main drivers affecting these patterns. We also investigated the spatial distribution of hotspots using a threshold approach and compared them with the home ranges of the flagship species, Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus).Result: Climate and soil are predominant drivers shaping the spatial pattern of plant diversity in Bawangling Nature Reserve, surpassing the influence of anthropogenic disturbance and topographic factors. Both diversity indices exhibit a generally similar pattern with exceptions in surrounding areas of Futouling and Elongling. The hotspots identified by the Shannon-Wiener index showed a higher spatial overlap with the home ranges of Hainan gibbon compared to the species richness hotspots. The recently established Hainan gibbon Group E in 2019, located 8 km away from the original Futouling habitat, does not coincide with identified hotspots.Discussion: Our findings indicate that the hotspots of plant diversity within the habitat of Hainan gibbon Group E are relatively limited, emphasizing the necessity of giving precedence to its conservation. Integrating hotspots with the home ranges of critically endangered species offers decision-makers valuable information to establish rational conservation networks in the context of changing environments, as well as a reference for habitat restoration of species.

AB  - In tropical forests, understory herbaceous angiosperms (herbs), which can comprise up to 40% of plant species richness, have received relatively little attention compared with trees, and their diversity patterns and drivers remain poorly understood. While tropical tree diversity has been shown to be driven primarily by water availability, we hypothesized that herb diversity may be equally or more limited by light availability. To test the importance of water and light in shaping herb diversity, we surveyed herb communities in 13 one-ha plots along a rainfall gradient in a seasonally dry tropical forest landscape in India. In each plot, herbs were censused thrice during the year in 47-50 one-m(2) subplots. We examined drivers of herb diversity and ground cover at the landscape scale (across plots) and local scale (among subplots) using simple linear regression and linear mixed models, respectively. At the landscape scale, herb diversity and ground cover were negatively related to rainfall and soil moisture, in contrast with previous studies of tropical forest trees. This indicates that water was not limiting for herbs. Instead, light availability, which was negatively correlated with rainfall, appears to drive patterns of herb diversity and ground cover across the gradient. Herb diversity and ground cover were uniformly low across the gradient during the dry season, indicating that water limitation does have a seasonal impact. When water was abundant (rainy season), herbs took advantage of higher light availability at more open (lower-rainfall) plots. Consistent with landscape-scale patterns, herb richness at the subplot level was positively related to light availability, with its effect stronger at higher-rainfall (more closed-canopy) sites. Herb species richness declined with increasing subplot soil moisture in all sites and seasons, suggesting negative impacts of water logging and high moisture. Synthesis. Diversity of understory herbs is limited by light availability at both local and landscape scales in this region, with the impact of water limitation restricted to the dry season. Our study shows that tree diversity patterns cannot be assumed to hold for other plant lifeforms, and conservation and restoration efforts must consider unique strategies for different lifeforms.

AB  - Biodiversity loss likely occurs in alpine ecosystems under climate warming. However, little is known about the effect of plant functional type loss on the litter decomposition rate and microbial community composition. To test whether single functional type loss has a significant impact on the litter decomposition and microbial community composition, we conducted a litterbag experiment by randomly removing a single functional type from the litter mixtures of six functional types (evergreen conifer, evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrub, graminoid, forb and fern). Moreover, incubation sites were established in two vegetation types with contrasting microclimatic conditions in an alpine timberline ecotone. Based on a two-year decomposition experiment, we found that random loss of the single plant functional type did not significantly affect the mass loss rates and microbial community biomass and structure in the two vegetation types. Moreover, most losses of single plant functional type affected the investigated mass loss rates and microbial parameters in an additive way. In contrast, there were significant effects of vegetation type on the microbial community composition, irrespective of plant functional type loss treatments. We conclude that mass loss rates and microbial parameters in litter mixtures are largely predictable from those in individual plant functional type in the alpine timberline ecotone. Our findings suggest that, under climate change scenarios, losses of single plant functional type possibly induced by upward shifts of alpine plants would alter the microbial community composition in litters only under the condition of changes in microclimatic factors (i.e., moisture and temperature), which would have a profound impact on alpine ecosystems.

AB  - Urbanization is a major driver of environmental change, which calls for multifunctional and comprehensive actions such as Nature-based Solutions (NbS). They are "inspired and supported by nature... and must benefit biodiversity and support the delivery of a range of ecosystem services". But what nature should one aim for? We tested the hypothesis that local vegetation may not always be the best source of inspiration, as environmental changes impact both extant con-ditions and species suitability for restored ecosystems. We analyzed the megacity of Sa tilde o Paulo, where laws promote the use of species from the local Atlantic Forest biome. We trained a Linear Discriminant Analysis to classify the Brazilian biomes and predicted the biomes' correspondence considering city's vegetation cover and climate. With 80% accuracy, the model predicted cor-respondence with the Atlantic Forest in 57% of the city, while 43% is better represented by the Cerrado, a dense Tropical Savanna biome. Cerrado species are naturally adapted to higher insolation, temperature and more seasonal precipitation, and they can parallel the ecosystem services of the Atlantic Forest. To help guide NbS implementation, we consider four "urban bi-omes": Atlantic Forest, Seasonally Flooded Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and the Seasonally Flooded Cerrado, whose dynamics seem to depend mainly on changes in the proportion of dense vege-tation cover. We then discuss possible examples of NbS in the city.Results: According to the PCA (Tables S3-S6), the main difference between the classification of the green spaces classified is the higher proportion of forest cover in those classified as Mata Atlantica, with almost any influence from other vegetation cover types (Fig. 5E). This pattern is still consistent when vegetation cover is evaluated outside the largest green spaces where the presence of even small forest patches across the urban fabric results in the Mata Atla circumflex accent ntica categoryDiscussion: The urban ecosystem restoration could benefit from such natural and dynamic pro-cesses in which the Cerrado could act as a transient urban biome in the way of restoring the urban forests through soil horizon development and species succession followed by the densification of the vegetation whenever this planting scheme is possible.

AB  - 1. Restoration of disturbed environments in which soil surface layers have been removed is challenging and its success depends on the characteristics of the exposed soil layers and neighbour organisms. Dung beetles are important elements in the restoration of degraded habitats as secondary seed dispersers. 2. In this study, we first assessed how the removal of upper soil layers affected the assemblage of dung beetle compared to adjacent reference areas without soil removal. We also evaluated the efficiency of dung beetles as secondary seed dispersers by experimentally testing their effect on the germination of wolf apple seeds (Solanum lycocarpum). 3. Degraded areas harboured a different dung beetle assemblage compared to the reference area, with a predominance of habitat generalist species. In addition, we found higher abundance and richness of dung beetles in the degraded than in reference areas. Despite dung removal being similar between areas, more seeds were removed in the reference area. 4. Dung beetles, especially rollers, positively influenced the probability of wolf apple seed germination in the degraded environment by up to 5%; germination occurred in 27% of treatments with dung beetle presence and no germination occurred when beetles were excluded. 5. Therefore, promoting the attraction of dung beetles from reference areas, together with other techniques that enhance primary seed dispersion, mainly by mammals and birds, could potentially increase the success of projects to restore areas with degraded soil.

AB  - Mixed-species plantation forests are of high interest both because of their potentially superior productivity and multi-functionality benefits over monocultures. However, how trees of different species interact at the canopy level in mixed forests remains unclear, even at young growth stages. We tested whether crown shape and size and stand-level canopy packing were affected by stand composition and how mixture effects varied with stand density and irrigation. We measured crown attributes in pure and mixed plots of two light-demanding species, silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), in a 10-year-old tree diversity experiment (ORPHEE). This allowed us to estimate tree-level crown volumes and stand-level canopy packing. We found that (i) at the tree level, stand composition influenced crown-stem allometric relationships in pine but not in birch, (ii) mixture led to greater crown and tree dimensions in pine, but to the opposite for birch, (iii) the changes in crown volume resulted in a higher canopy packing in mixed stands, only at high density and with no irrigation, i.e., under highest constraints for light availability but also soil water availability, contrary to initial expectations. This study sheds light on the effects of water constraints on the aboveground mechanistic processes that explain greater productivity in young mixed plantations, and improves our understanding of canopy packing in mixed stands.

AB  - Geographic isolation plays a major role in biological diversification. Yet, adaptive divergence also can occur with ongoing gene flow, but the minimal spatial scale required for this is unclear. Here, we hypothesized that local gradients in soil clay and water contents respectively select for anti-adherent and hypoxia-tolerant phenotypes in soil invertebrates, thereby driving intraspecific phenotypic divergence despite unlimited, passive dispersal. We tested this idea using the parthenogenetic oribatid mite Rostrozetes ovulum, an abundant species in tropical forest soils. We obtained 40 individuals from valleys and uplands within 4 km(2) of rainforest in central Amazonia, and estimated soil clay and water contents for each site. Then, we experimentally assessed submersion tolerance of each individual, measured its body size, shape and structural traits, and inferred anti-adherence from the extent of debris attached to its body. We found that morphological distance was greater between than within habitats while being independent of geographic distance, which itself was unrelated to habitat. Further, using structural equation modelling, we found that clayish soils harboured mites with fewer, larger dorsal pits that were less likely to have attached debris, consistent with an anti-adherent morphology. To a lower degree, individuals from moister soils tended to survive submersion longer, likely through anaerobiosis. These patterns could reflect phenotypic plasticity, local adaptation or some combination thereof. Altogether, they suggest that environmental gradients may trigger local-scale animal diversification in soils, contributing to the exceptional biodiversity of this substrate.

AB  - Springs are discharges from groundwater that form water flows which are important in the provision of ecosystem services, such as irrigation of forests, supply of water for human consumption and the habitat for the aquatic biota. In Brazil, areas of Atlantic Forest are gradually being replaced by eucalypt crops, commonly changing the composition of the springs substrate. The objective of this study was to verify if the granulometric composition of the spring sediment in forest areas differs from that of springs in areas planted with eucalyptus. The tested hypothesis was that springs in eucalypts areas have differences in particle size and a lower percentage of organic matter when compared to springs in forest areas. To do so, the sediment from 20 springs was collected, all belonging to the Paraiba do Sul river basin, located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. It was possible to observe that springs in forest areas were associated with very coarse sand, while those in eucalyptus areas were associated with finer granulometry particles. Regarding the organic matter, no significant difference was observed between the two areas. The study emphasizes the importance of riparian vegetation to mitigate potential impacts of eucalyptus silviculture on the sediment of springs.

AB  - Reducing the risk of large, severe wildfires while also increasing the security of mountain water supplies and enhancing biodiversity are urgent priorities in western US forests. After a century of fire suppression, Yosemite and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Parks located in California's Sierra Nevada initiated programs to manage wildfires and these areas present a rare opportunity to study the effects of restored fire regimes. Forest cover decreased during the managed wildfire period and meadow and shrubland cover increased, especially in Yosemite's Illilouette Creek basin that experienced a 20% reduction in forest area. These areas now support greater pyrodiversity and consequently greater landscape and species diversity. Soil moisture increased and drought-induced tree mortality decreased, especially in Illilouette where wildfires have been allowed to burn more freely resulting in a 30% increase in summer soil moisture. Modeling suggests that the ecohydrological co-benefits of restoring fire regimes are robust to the projected climatic warming. Support will be needed from the highest levels of government and the public to maintain existing programs and expand them to other forested areas.

AB  - During a study of biodiversity of cyanobacteria in Gorely volcano soils (Kamchatka Peninsula), a strain of heterocytous, a false branching cyanobacterium with gradually tapered filaments, was isolated. Prominent features of the strain were purplish-grey trichomes and firm, distinct multilayered sheaths. Based on the results obtained from the morphological, ecological, and phylogenetic analysis using the 16S rRNA and 16S-23S ITS region, 16S-23S ITS secondary structure analysis, comparison of flanking regions of BoxB and V3 helices, and the p-distance between the 16S-23S ITS region, we describe our strain K7 as a novel species of the genus Roholtiella with the name Roholtiella volcanica sp. nov., in accordance with the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants. This work continues the rapid expansion of the description of new taxa of cyanobacteria, and particularly demonstrates a coming phase in cyanobacterial taxonomy in which the discovery of new species in recently described genera rapidly increases our understanding of the diversity in this phylum.

AB  - 1. Litter decomposition rates are determined by the interplay of climate, decomposer organisms and litter quality. It has been suggested that the decomposer community may be locally adapted to litter quality, providing a home-field advantage (HFA) resulting in accelerated decomposition of local compared to non-local litter, after accounting for decomposition differences due to litter quality and the functional capacity of microorganisms. Although widely tested in forests, this hypothesis remains controversial and lacks support of its generality across climates.
   2. We therefore tested the HFA hypothesis for litter decomposition in four contrasting ecosystems along an extensive climatic gradient in Chile, using a translocation experiment involving litter from 20 species. In addition to comparing mass loss, we adopted a novel way to disentangle decomposer effects from climate effects, based on loss rates of elements that are actively released from the litter by decomposers during its breakdown versus elements that are simply leached by precipitation. We used the ratios of nitrogen and potassium losses (N/K loss) and phosphorus and potassium losses (P/K loss) to unravel the relative role of microbial breakdown (N and P loss) versus physical leaching (K loss) along the climate gradient. Thus, at each site, we tested whether litter mass loss, N/K loss and P/K loss presented an additional loss due to a HFA for local compared to non-local litter.
   3. Across a wide range of environments and litter types, our findings unequivocally contradicted the HFA hypothesis. We observed no significantly positive HFA along the gradient; however, litter quality and the general ability of the decomposer community influenced litter decomposition much more strongly than origin or location of the litter.
   4. Our study questions the applicability of the HFA for litter decomposition and calls for more studies that include a large range of climatic conditions to understand the context-dependency of HFA.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx: nitrogen dioxide [NO2] + nitric oxide [NO]) play important roles in atmospheric chemistry. Throughout most of Africa, emissions of these gases are predominantly from soils and biomass burning. Here we use observations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument from 2005 through 2017 and atmospheric NH3 VCDs from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer from 2008 through 2017 to evaluate seasonal variation of NO2 and NH3 VCDs across Africa and in seven African ecoregions. In regions where mean annual precipitation (MAP) is under 500 mm yr(-1), we find that NO2 and NH3 VCDs are positively related to monthly precipitation, and where MAP is between 500 and 1,750 mm yr(-1) or higher, NO2 VCDs are negatively related to monthly precipitation. In dry ecoregions, temperature and precipitation were important predictors of NH3 and NO2 VCDs, likely related to variation in soil emissions. In mesic ecoregions, monthly NO2 VCDs were strongly related to burned area, suggesting that biomass burning drives seasonality. NH3 VCDs in mesic ecoregions were positively related to both monthly temperature and monthly carbon monoxide (CO) VCDs, suggesting that a mixture of soil and biomass burning emissions influenced NH3 seasonality. In northern mesic ecoregions, monthly temperature explained most of the variance in monthly NH3 VCDs, suggesting that soil sources, including animal excreta, determined NH3 seasonality. In southern mesic ecoregions, monthly CO VCDs explained more variation in NH3 VCDs than temperature, suggesting that biomass burning may have greater influence over NH3 seasonality.

AB  - Simple Summary
   This study analyzed the abundance and diversity of dung beetle communities at several disturbed sites in a tropical dry forest ecosystem in southern Ecuador. Dung beetle community diversity indices with different land uses were related to environmental variables (altitude, temperature), soil physicochemical properties, and food supply (manure). The results indicated that the species Canthon balteatus, Dichotomius problematicus, and Onthophagus confusus are abundant in disturbed sites, where soils are generally more compact and less fertile but contain a greater food supply. These findings can help decision makers to identify disturbed areas and to implement adequate policies for sustainable environmental management.
   This study evaluated the effects of land-use change (L-UCH) on dung beetle community structure (Scarabaeinae) in a disturbed dry ecosystem in southern Ecuador. Five different L-UCH classes were analyzed by capturing the dung beetle species at each site using 120 pitfall traps in total. To determine dung beetle abundance and diversity at each L-UCH, a general linear model (GLM) and a redundancy analysis (RDA) were applied, which correlated environmental and edaphic conditions to the community structure. Furthermore, changes in dung-producing vertebrate fauna were examined, which varied significantly between the different L-UCH classes due to the specific anthropogenic use or level of ecosystem disturbance. The results indicated that soil organic matter, pH, potassium, and phosphorus (RDA: component 1), as well as temperature and altitude (RDA: component 2) significantly affect the abundance of beetles (GLM: p value < 0.001), besides the food availability (dung). The highest abundance and diversity (Simpson's index > 0.4, Shannon-Wiener index > 1.10) was found in highly disturbed sites, where soils were generally more compacted, but with a greater food supply due to the introduced farm animals. At highly disturbed sites, the species Canthon balteatus, Dichotomius problematicus, and Onthphagus confuses were found specifically, which makes them useful as bio-indicators for disturbed dry forest ecosystems in southern Ecuador.

AB  - We used Chironomidae functional attributes to assess how spatial and temporal scales influence assemblage structure. We collected Chironomidae larvae in 10 streams from southern Brazil over 5 years and measured land use, limnological variables, and rainfall. We use substrate and habitat preference as ecological attributes and feeding habits and tube construction as biological attributes. We performed a between-class correspondence analysis using spatial and temporal scales. In years with greater rainfall and turbidity and lower water temperature, the predominant functional characteristics were preferred for lotic environment and leaf substrate. On the spatial scale, in streams that showed more exposed soil, the predominant functional characteristics were lentic habitat and muddy substrate. For streams with more vegetation, pasture, and electrical conductivity, the ecological trait was leaf substrate. The functional structure of assemblage responds to both scales only for ecological attributes. On the spatial scale, we observed that land use was the main predictor, whereas on the temporal scale, rainfall was the most important predictor. We emphasize that extreme climatological phenomena can potentialize the effects of environmental variables, which shows the importance of the time scale for environmental quality.

AB  - Fragmented and degraded ecosystems should be restored to ensure the biological connectivity among fragmented forest landscapes. The tropical rainforests of Southwestern Sri Lanka are highly degraded and fragmented due to plantation agriculture and human settlements. However, the high spatial variation in environmental factors and ecosystem functions challenge the success rate of restoration interventions. The aim of this study was to assess the vegetation composition and stand structure in relation to the spatial variation in key soil physicochemical parameters in the Endane Biodiversity Corridor that links peripheral forest reserve to the Sinharaja Rainforest Complex (SRC). The site that extends over 24 ha was classified into five land-use categories (productive tea lands, marginal tea lands, scrub-abandoned three years ago, and two woodlands-abandoned 15 years ago) in which the vegetation composition, stand structure, and physicochemical parameters of soil were assessed and mapped. Results revealed that the Shannon diversity index in the scrub and the woodlands were higher than in the tea lands. The diversity among the secondary forest patches was similar. However, with a mean record of 14 species, the species richness was high in sites close to the SRC. In comparison to the SRC (358 Mg ha(-1)), there was a substantial potential to sequester more carbon in the restoration sites (12-108 Mg ha(-1)). While explaining 31% of abundance and species distribution, the ordination results revealed a close relationship of the soil parameters to vegetation composition and species abundance. The calculated coefficient variation values for soil parameters (TN, EC, Av.P, Ex.K, OC, and BD) were beyond 12%, indicating high or moderate soil spatial variability among the land use categories. Coefficient of variation for soil pH was estimated to be 9%, revealing low soil spatial variability among the land use categories. The maps of these soil parameters corresponded with the type of land use and fertilizer application to tea fields. The highest and the lowest total N contents were observed in the scrub and woodlands, respectively, which appears to be mediated by the relative composition of N-fixing trees between the two groups. Our results facilitate effective matching of sites to species for restoration of the Endane Biodiversity Corridor that may be replicated in similar restoration contexts in tropical Asia.

AB  - Dung beetles play an important role in the sustainability of agroecosystems by providing various ecosystem services. The spatial distribution of species can be affected by vegetation structure and soil type at a small scale. Our study was conducted in a cattle ranch in which there were two grassland areas with different types of soil (humid silty clay vs. dry clay) and a plantation of Eucalyptus L'Her. (Myrtaceae). The aim of this study was to analyze variations in diversity and structure of dung beetle assemblages by considering the feeding guilds (coprophagous, necrophagous, and generalists) and functional groups (paracoprids, telecoprids, and non-nester dwellers) among the three mentioned habitats. Nine pitfall traps baited with cow dung. horse dung, or carrion were placed simultaneously at each site every two weeks over the course of a year. Coprophagous species dominated over necrophagous and generalist species in abundance and biomass in each habitat. The highest species richness occurred in the pasture on humid silty clay soil and the lowest in the Eucalyptus plantation. Abundance and biomass of paracoprids were highest in the pasture on humid silty clay soil, while non-nester dwellers dominated in the pasture on dry clay soil and the Eucalyptus plantation. Large paracoprids were almost non-existent in the pasture with dry clay soil. In the Eucalyptus plantation, the marked reduction in species richness, particularly of telecoprids and paracoprids. the increase in species dominance, and the absence of rare species were clear indicators of an adversely affected environment.

AB  - Colicodendron scabridum, commonly known as " sapote", is one of the most common woody species in seasonally dry neotropical forests, and an important food for numerous animals. We investigated sapote's reproductive phenology and evaluated its relationship to temperature and precipitation. To do so, we installed seven 2 m x 300 m transects, each with fifteen focal individual sapote trees, at seven sites from 257 - 353 m at Cerro Venado, Lambayeque, Peru. The duration of flowering and fruiting varied among individuals, sites, and years. On average, 85-97 % of individuals with flowers bore fruit. The average fruiting period was shorter than the average flowering period, which it followed three months later. We used a cross correlation test to evaluate the relationship between flowering, and fruiting, with the monthly average temperature and precipitation. Sapote flowering changed in opposition to monthly average temperature, with a strong inverse correlation between flowering and temperature. In contrast, the frequency of individuals with fruits was positively correlated with temperature. There was no relationship between monthly precipitation with either flowering or fruiting. Our results suggest that temperature may determine when the species reproduces, thus affecting food availability for wildlife. The phenological variations we recorded are relevant to decisions for the conservation of this species.

AB  - Ecological niche model (ENM) pertains to a class of methodologies that utilise occurrence data alongside environmental data to formulate a correlative model of the environmental circumstances that satisfy a species' ecological requirements. In the current study, ENM was employed to ascertain the types of habitat for Trichoderma harzianum using machine learning algorithm known as MaxEnt Entropy. Our line of reasoning posits that the efficacy of T. harzianum as a bio-control agent can be enhanced, alongside the advancement of host/crop development and metabolic processes, through its deliberate introduction into geographically appropriate habitats. ENM was performed on 92 spatially thinned presence points of this species across India, considering three bio-climatic time periods (present, 2050, and 2070) and four greenhouse gas scenarios (known as representative concentration pathways RCPs). Non-bioclimatic factors include ecosystem rooting depths (ERD), total plant available water storage capacity (TPAWSC), habitat heterogeneity indices (HHI), land use land cover (LULC) and to soil variables at four depths. Energy-related factors, like Isothermality and minimum temperature of coldest month, were shown to be the most essential for the habitat appropriateness of this species during the current bio-climatic period. Future climate predictions and their associated RCPs revealed that water-related variables, like precipitation of wettest quarter, were the most influential. Non-climatic elements that were shown to have significant impact included soil pH, maximum diversity indices, forest and grassland types, TPAWSC, ERD (95%). Our analysis showed that this species will always find optimal suitability sites in northern eastern India with almost all predictors except root zone variables.

AB  - Tropical rainforests in the central hilly section of Hainan Island are the source of the Nandu, Changhua, and Wanquan rivers, which are crucial for water conservation and ecological protection. The quantitative assessment of water yield in the three basins is beneficial for developing regional water resource protection plans, establishing ecological compensation mechanisms, and maintaining ecological balance. Based on land use data from five periods between 1980 and 2020, this paper adopts the InVEST model and geographic detectors to investigate the spatial-temporal variation characteristics and driving factors of water yield in three major basins of Hainan Island. The results demonstrate that forestland, which makes up more than 70% of the total area in the three basins of Hainan Island, is the predominant land use type. With a depth of 1269.18 mm, Wanquan Basin is the deepest of the three basins, followed by Nandu Basin and Changhua Basin. The total water yield of three basins shows a slightly decreasing trend from 17.991 billion m(3) in 1980 to 17.864 billion m(3) in 2020. The spatial distribution of water yield is high in the southeast region and low in the northwest region, with strong autocorrelation and significant aggregation. According to geographic detection, land use type is the dominant factor for the spatial differentiation of water yield in the three basins, with a contribution rate of 0.563, and soil type and annual precipitation are important impact factors. The interaction and synergy of soil types and land use types jointly affect the spatial differentiation of water yield in the basin. The results of this study can provide data support and scientific references for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration in the three major basins of Hainan Island.

AB  - Tree-based ecosystems are critical to climate change mitigation. The study analysed carbon (C) stock patterns and examined the importance of environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). We conducted a synthesis of 100 studies reporting biomass carbon stock and 67 studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock from four land-uses: forests, plantation, agroforest, and herbaceous ecosystem from the IHR. Machine learning techniques were used to examine the importance of various environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils. Despite large variations in biomass C and SOC stock (mean +/- SD) within the land-uses, natural forests have the highest biomass C stock (138.5 +/- 87.3 Mg C ha(-1)), and plantation forests exhibited the highest SOC stock (168.8 +/- 74.4 Mg C ha(-1)) in the top 1-mof soils. The relationship between the environmental variables (altitude, latitude, precipitation, and temperature) and carbon stock was not significantly correlated. The prediction of biomass carbon and SOC stock using different machine learning techniques (Adaboost, Bagging, Random Forest, and XGBoost) shows that the XGBoost model can predict the carbon stock for the IHR closely. Our study confirms that the carbon stock in the IHR vary on a large scale due to a diverse range of land-use and ecosystems within the region. Therefore, predicting the driver of carbon stock on a single environmental variable is impossible for the entire IHR. The IHR possesses a prominent carbon sink and biodiversity pool. Therefore, its protection is essential in fulfilling India's commitment to nationally determined contributions (NDC). Our data synthesis may also provide a baseline for the precise estimation of carbon stock, which will be vital for India's National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem (NMSHE).

AB  - We present a multi-proxy, postglacial paleorecord from Chase Lake, a 1.63-km(2) drainage lake in northern Maine. This record, along with published paleorecords from several smaller lakes and hollows allow us to synthesize a long-term natural history of the area. Northern Maine is unique in the northeastern USA as it was the last part to be deglaciated and has maintained a relatively cold climate and boreal flora. The diverse lake/catchment sites differed in dates of deglaciation (13,700 to 13,200 cal yr BP) and the duration of the ensuing tundra period (1700 to 2900 cal yr). A dry. cold climate slowed plant establishment. Chase Lake had low aquatic productivity until the end of the tundra period. The Chase record shows that afforestation began similar to 10,600 cal yr BP, similar to 1000 years after the end of the Younger Dryas, and 700-1400 years later than at the other sites, and was completed by 9200 cal yr BP. Initial open woodlands of Picea (spruce) (largely P. mariana [Black Spruce]), Abies balsamea (Balsam Fir), Larix laricina (American Larch), Pinus (pines), Betula papyrifera (Paper Birch), and Populus (poplars) gradually became closed forest. Climate substantially warmed at the outset of afforestation. Despite evidence of an increasingly wetter climate, as indicated by rising water levels at 2 seepage lakes, fire was common for the first 2000-3000 years of woodland and forest history, probably enabled by summer droughts. This fire period is not matched in intensity and duration later in the paleorecords. At Chase, afforestation was accompanied by an increase in insect remains including microlepidopteran defoliators, and these remained abundant for the rest of the record. Major increases of aquatic biota accompanied afforestation. Spruce greatly decreased by similar to 7500 cal yr BP as northern hardwoods and Tsuga canadensis (Eastern Hemlock) increased, but hemlock abundance remained low compared to farther south in the Northeast. From 7500 to 1300 cal yr BP. temperate tree taxa were at maximum abundances. Spruce and fir were at postglacial minima 6250-4400 cal yr BP. A relatively dry period 5300-3300 cal yr BP nearly eliminated hemlock at the outset. when it was replaced largely by Fagus (beech). Hemlock's partial recovery late in that period was accompanied by increasing Thuja (cedar) and decreasing Quercus (oak), the beginning of climate cooling and resumption of wetter conditions. This climate trend intensified after 3300 cal yr BP, resulting in further increases of cedar. spruce (largely Picea rubens [Red Spruce] and Black Spruce) and fir, which reached greatest postglacial abundances in the most recent 1000-1500 years. Long-term natural histories of selected woody taxa provide insights on ecological factors accounting for changes in species abundances. For example, the flourishing of cedar in the late-Holocene could have been abetted by increasing winter severity that eliminated Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer), heavy browsers on cedar. The geochemical history of the Chase catchment demonstrates ongoing weathering and depletion of several metals, resulting in enrichment of soils with silica. Several changes in metal concentrations are linked to afforestation, including increased transport to the lake sediment of Ca, K, Al. Fe. Cu, and Zn in/on increased organic detritus. Accumulation rates of metals and organic materials in the Chase Lake sediment were probably heavily influenced by physical processes including catchment erosion, shifts in sediment sources, and in-lake focusing.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementTropical forests provide global ecosystem services and harbor much of Earth's terrestrial biodiversity, but the mechanisms driving the patterns of biodiversity remain uncertain. Palms are one of the most abundant and most widely used plant groups, particularly in the Neotropics. Our data highlight how both direct and indirect human influence that occurred decades to hundreds of years ago can affect the abundances of palm species in modern tropical forests. Our results highlight that biodiversity is dynamic, and changes through time, and that human activities can affect species composition for centuries in tropical forests. Human activities over the past decades and centuries, including fire, cultivation, and forest opening, may have left ecological legacies that persist in modern tropical forests, particularly among palms. We investigated whether past human activities affected modern palm abundances in a well-studied plot located in a tropical semievergreen forest of Panama.We analyzed soil cores for charcoal to reconstruct past fire events and phytoliths to reconstruct past vegetation changes. We dated as many charcoal fragments as possible to place a temporal framework on past fire events.Our analysis documented widespread fires that occurred 600-900 years ago across the plot. Oenocarpus mapora increased in abundance as a result of these fires, though other palms did not. A subsequent increase in O. mapora occurred later in the relative absence of fire and was likely due to game hunting during the construction of the Panama Canal.Our results showed that the enrichment of O. mapora was determined by disturbance characteristics (e.g., timing, type, and intensity), but the persistence of increased abundances was likely determined by traits (life history characteristics). These data highlight the complexity of human-environment interactions and how they can persist for centuries in settings with long-lived trees such as tropical forests. These data highlight the importance of adding a historical context to further understand modern ecological patterns and processes.

AB  - Individual tree species might affect underground soil properties to favor the decomposition of their own litter. However, in some studies, monospecific litter decomposed faster underneath multispecific canopies than under canopies of the same species as the litter, suggesting that plant diversity in the overstorey creates a more favorable decomposition microenvironment. We compared the decomposition rate of monospecific litter from eight temperate tree species under the crown of the same species as the litter (conspecific canopy), and a multispecific canopy formed by eight species. Using model selection, we determined the influence of the microenvironments, species, and litter chemistry on decomposition rates. The most robust model included the species and canopy type, but it differed only slightly from the model including only the species. Decomposition rates were significantly different among species and higher in conspecific canopy than multispecific canopy in all species. Models including specific leaf area and different combinations of chemical traits of the litter were less robust than the null model. These results show that the species origin of the litter was significantly more important than the microenvironment to explain litter decomposition rates.

AB  - Robinia pseudoacacia L. is one of the most common and environmentally adaptable introduced tree species which has become an important element of artificial afforestation and landscaping in Ukraine over the past 150 years. Throughout the history of its introduction on the territory of Ukraine, this species was considered resistant because of the absence of dangerous phytophages. At the beginning of the XXI century, the phytosanitary situation changed as the result of the penetration and rapid spread of a number of North American invasive phytophages. The appearance and distribution of the miner Parectopa robiniella (Clemens, 1863) (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) feeding on R. pseudoacacia was recognized as the largest invasion in Ukraine. This paper considers the issues of studying the effect of P. robiniella caterpillars feeding on R. pseudoacacia in various forest-growing conditions in the steppe zone of Ukraine. The process of photosynthesis, as the most important physiological parameter, was chosen as indicator of condition. The study was conducted using biosensor technology which made it possible to measure the effect of caterpillar feeding on critical parameters of chlorophyll fluorescence (the Kautsky curve). The research has shown that the initial value of fluorescence induction was within the range of 196-284 RFU, and the maximum value of the background fluorescence parameter was recorded in undamaged leaves and under shading conditions. Both the effect of phytophages and the shading factor caused a significant decrease in the values of fluorescence induction of the "plateau" both in the conditions of an artificially washed sandbar, on the watershed area of a watershed-gully landscape, as well as on natural sandy-loam soil. The maximum values of photosynthetic fluorescence induction under the simultaneous influence of the studied factors had rather high variability. In contrast to the fluorescence induction parameter, the "plateau" of the highest maximum fluorescence induction was reached in the absence of pest damage under conditions of total shading. As revealed by dispersion and regression analyses, the maximum fluorescence index was most dependent on the amount of solar radiation and on the degree of the leaf surface damage by phytophages. Significantly higher values of the steady-state fluorescence induction parameter were determined in the absence of insect damage in both shading and lighting conditions. A statistically significant combined influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the "plateau" fluorescence induction parameter was determined in comparison with the mono-influence of individual factors. A highly significant dependence of the maximum efficiency indicator of primary photosynthesis processes on individual factors of exogenous influence was established, while the combined effect of these factors did not affect this parameter. The obtained data allow one to apply in practice the methods of analyzing chlorophyll fluorescence induction to establish the physiological state of tree flora in forest and garden farms.

AB  - Forest plays a vital role in the global biogeochemical cycles through a high rate of carbon sequestration and harboring biodiversity. However, local species diversity is declining while also becoming increasingly homogenized across communities. Although effects of local biotic processes (e.g., species alpha-diversity and stand structural heterogeneity) and environmental factors on aboveground biomass (AGB) have been widely tested, there is a huge knowledge gap for the effect of regional biotic processes (i.e., taxonomic and functional beta-diversity) in forests. Here, we hypothesized that regional and local environmental factors along with biotic processes jointly regulate AGB through species shifts in tropical forests. Using piecewise structural equation modeling (pSEM), we linked climatic water availability, soil fertility, stand structural heterogeneity (either tree DBH inequality, height inequality, or stand density), species alpha-diversity, taxonomic or functional beta-diversity (and its two components; beta-turnover and beta-richness), and AGB across 189 inventory plots in tropical forests of Sri Lanka. Soil fertility and climatic water availability shaped local and regional biotic processes. Stand structural heterogeneity promoted species alpha-diversity but declined beta-diversity (but increased beta-taxonomic turnover). Species alpha-diversity and stand structural heterogeneity promoted AGB whereas taxonomic and functional beta-diversity declined (but beta-taxonomic turnover increased) AGB. The relationships of AGB with species alpha-diversity and beta-diversity varied from significant to nonsignificant positive depending on the specific combinations of stand structural heterogeneity metrics used. This study shows that local biotic processes could increase AGB due to the local and regional niche complementarity effect whereas the regional biotic processes could restrict AGB due to the regional selection or functional redundancy effect under favorable environmental conditions. We argue that biotic homogenization, as well as drought conditions, may have strong divergent impacts on forest functions and that the impacts of tree diversity loss may greatly reduce carbon sequestration.

AB  - Remote sensing provides cost-effective and unbiased data and thus is ideal for assessing climate-vegetation relationships. Such relationships can be quantified using geographically weighted regression (GWR) approach to account for variations of the relationships across space. This approach was applied in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa that is rich in biodiversity hosting 10 of the country's 11 biomes. The study aimed to determine if the GWR accuracy for relating Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) with rainfall and Land Sur-face Temperature (LST) shows an optimal pattern with time and space. and to explore if the correlation of EVI with rainfall and LST varies with biome type. Monthly data cover-ing February 20 0 0 to December 2017 were used for the three variables. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) was greater than 0.5 for 75% of the locations, with month-to-month change of R 2 exceeding 25% for many locations. Optimized Hot Spot Analysis returned well-defined broad clusters of high and low R 2 values separated by clusters of randomly distributed R 2 values. These clusters shifted with month, further stressing the benefit of modelling at the monthly scale. Assessment of R 2 by biome showed the importance of biomes in characterizing GWR of climate and vegetation, with better correlations found in low biodiversity (Succulent Karoo and Nama-Karoo biomes) than in higher biodiversity (Forest and Indian Ocean Coastal Belt biomes) zones. Further, the estimation residuals of the Forest Biome varied significantly from 3 to 5 other biomes across the year indicating the complex interaction of this biome with rainfall and LST. The study encourages further research by using high temporal resolution data for detailed monitoring within the GWR framework.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Tropical volcanic islands are biodiversity hotspots where the Critical Zone (CZ) still remains poorly studied. In such steep topographic environments associated with extreme climatic events (cyclones), deployment and maintenance of monitoring equipment is highly challenging. While a few Critical Zone Observatories (CZOS) are located in tropical volcanic regions, none of them includes a Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (TMCF) at the watershed scale. We present here the dataset of the first observatory from the French network of critical zone observatories (OZCAR) located in an insular tropical and volcanic context, integrating a 'Tropical Montane Cloud Forest': The ERORUN-STAFOR observatory. This collaborative observatory is located in the northern part of La Reunion island (Indian Ocean) within the 45.0 km2 watershed of Riviere des Pluies (i.e., Rainfall river) which hosts the TMCF of Plaines des Fougeres, one of the best preserved natural habitats in La Reunion Island. Since 2014, the ERORUN-STAFOR monitoring in collaboration with local partners collected a multidisciplinary dataset with a constant improvement of the instrumentation over time. At the watershed scale and in its vicinity, the ERORUN-STAFOR observatory includes 10 measurement stations covering the upstream, midstream and downstream part of the watershed. The stations record a total of 48 different variables through continuous (sensors) or periodic (sampling) monitoring. The dataset consists of continuous time series variables related to (i) meteorology, including precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, net radiation, atmospheric pressure, cloud water flux, irradiance, leaf wetness and soil temperature, (ii) hydrology, including water level and temperature, discharge and electrical conductivity (EC) of stream, (iii) hydrogeology, including (ground)water level, water temperature and EC in two piezometers and one horizontally drilled groundwater gallery completed by soil moisture measurements under the canopy. The dataset is completed by periodic time series variables related to (iv) hydrogeochemistry, including field parameters and water analysis results. The periodic sampling survey provides chemical and isotopic compositions of rainfall, groundwater, and stream water at different locations of this watershed. The ERORUN-STAFOR monitoring dataset extends from 2014 to 2022 with an acquisition frequency from 10 min to hourly for the sensor variables and from weekly to monthly frequency for the sampling. Despite the frequent maintenance of the monitoring sites, several data gaps exist due to the remote location of some sites and instrument destruction by cyclones. Preliminary results show that the Riviere des Pluies watershed is characterized by high annual precipitation (>3000 mm y(-1)) and a fast hydrologic response to precipitation (approximate to 2 h basin lag time). The long-term evolution of the deep groundwater recharge is mainly driven by the occurrence of cyclone events with a seasonal groundwater response. The water chemical results support existing hydrogeological conceptual models suggesting a deep infiltration of the upstream infiltrated rainfall. The TMCF of Plaine des Fougeres shows a high water storage capacity (>2000% for the Bryophytes) that makes this one a significant input of water to groundwater recharge which still needs to be quantified.
   This observatory is a unique research site in an insular volcanic tropical environment offering three windows of observation for the study of critical zone processes through upstream-midstream-downstream measurements sites. This high-resolution dataset is valuable to assess the response of volcanic tropical watersheds and aquifers at both event and long-term scales (i.e., global change). It will also provide insights in the hydrogeological conceptual model of volcanic islands, including the significant role of the TMCFs in the recharge processes as well as the watershed hydrosedimentary responses to extreme climatic events and their respective evolution under changing climatic conditions. All data sets are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7983138.

AB  - Calcium carbonate records from alkaline fens provide valuable insights into past climate fluctuations. Yet, the climate is not the sole factor controlling tufa deposition. The present study aims to determine the drivers of postglacial tufa deposition at the exceptionally well-developed cupola alkaline fen located in the north-eastern Poland. Tufa deposition time frames and conditions are reconstructed using radiocarbon dating, geochemical, including loss on ignition and 813C and 818O, plant macrofossils, and mollusc analyses of two sediment sequences taken from the top and slope of the fen cupola. The exceptional in young-glacial area continuous Holocene-long history of CaCO3 precipitation was supported by a strong supply of artesian waters. The locally high endogenic heat flow density accelerated permafrost degradation and warranted the early start of artesian water circulation and tufa deposition ca. 11650 cal yr BP. Deposition of interlayered peat and tufa continued until ca. 4700 cal yr BP when the increasing height of the cupola disabled water outflow at the fen top, and peat with scattered CaCO3 started to accumulate. Seepages on the fen slopes supported deposition of interlayered peat and tufa on lower elevated parts of the mound until ca. 2300 cal yr BP. Colder and/or dryer episodes weakened the predominately intensive CaCO3 precipitation mainly at the top of the mound. Vegetation favoured tufa deposition (i) after the development of the soil, which enhanced chemical denudation of carbonate detritus from glacial deposits, (ii) during times of decreased evapotranspiration when the forest cover on the surrounding land diminished. Tufa deposition at the cupola top was limited between ca. 8450 and 4700 cal yr BP when trees entered the fen surface. The human impact on tufa deposition was likely limited except for the melioration of the surrounding area ca. 50 cal yr BP, after which CaCO3 precipitation eventually stopped.

AB  - Rainfall is one of the core components of the water cycle in terrestrial ecosystems and is closely related to hydrothermal balance, plant and animal growth, and stability of the whole ecosystem. Long-duration rainstorms can alter the soil structure of forest ecosystems and affect the spatial distribution of soil moisture, thus affecting the water supply from the soil to trees and being one of the factors that increase the vulnerability of forest ecosystems. In recent years, changes in rainfall patterns have normalized prolonged heavy rainfall in the mountainous areas of North China. However, there are few reports on the response of soil water at different depths to historically long rainstorms in forested areas. By quantifying the relationship between precipitation characteristics and soil water, the soil water transport patterns of Platycladus orientalis (PO), Quercus variabilis (QV) and Pinus tabuliformis (PT) during the long-duration rainstorms of 21-22 July 2012 were evaluated separately, and the roles of different plants in response to the historically long rainstorm were determined. The results showed that (1) the response of different forest stands to rainfall had a lag. Among them, the soil water of PO and PT were less affected by rainfall and could maintain a relatively stable state. (2) The soil moisture transport trend of PO was significantly greater than that of other vegetation zones and covered the whole process of rainfall. Under the three typical vegetation covers, there was a continuous zero-flux plane in the soil at each observed depth (the direction of soil moisture flow is more stable over the rainfall period), but there was no regular transport trend. (3) The root system was an important factor, influencing the differences in soil moisture response of the three vegetation types. QV had a higher average effective water recharge rate than lateral cypress and oleander and could better utilize the water recharge from storm water.

AB  - Identifying the dynamics of N-mineral soils in different Land Use Systems (LUS) with different levels of intensification, seven LUS were studied as well as intensive horticulture gardens. The coffee garden observed as of 7 - 10 years old. Measurements were made twice in the rainy and dry seasons. The use of forest land into coffee plantations and horticulture gardens was significantly (<0.05) to total-N, very significant (<0.01) to NO3- soil concentrations, but did not significantly affect the soil NH4+ concentration. Horticultural land has the lowest NH4+/N-mineral soil concentration ratio (0.98%) when it is compared to other LUS. The highest soil NO3- concentration (about 1400 mg kg(-1) soil) was found in intensive farming areas ie horticulture, about 5-17 times higher than in other LUS. The more intensive the land use system is followed by the increasing ratio of N-mineral/N-total soil concentration as well as the decrease in the NH4+/N-mineral soil concentration. This indicates that the more intensive the LUS will further decrease the economic efficiency of N utilization and increase the potential for loss of N through NO3- leaching, NO2 and NO evaporation, as well as run off, and potentially adverse impacts on aquatic biota due to eutrophication. This will lead to environmental damage, especially water pollution.

AB  - Eucalyptus plantations outside their native range-either as an income source or aimed at sequestering atmospheric carbon to combat climate change-are increasingly known to reduce local biodiversity and groundwater levels, and to increase soil degradation and erosion. One additional but less understood effect of Eucalyptus on native floras is allelopathy-the chemical inhibition of other plants' germination. Here we investigate the putative allelopathic effects of Eucalyptus globulus on the germination of Polylepis subtusalbida, a keystone species that characterizes a species-rich and highly threatened woodland habitat in the Bolivian Andes. We carry out controlled greenhouse experiments reflecting local rainfall, field litter quantity, and Eucalyptus leachate concentrations at multiple levels. Our results, based on five replicates with 390 Polylepis seeds each, show that contrary to our expectation Eucalyptus leachates does not affect germination significantly. Our findings suggest that projects aiming to remove Eucalyptus to restore Polylepis woodlands are likely to succeed even without the resource-consuming removal of leaf litter, and potentially also bark and roots, from the ground after tree felling.

AB  - Tropical forests are biodiversity hotspots, but it is not well understood how this diversity is structured and maintained. One hypothesis rests on the generation of a range of metabolic niches, with varied composition, supporting a high species diversity. Characterizing soil metabolomes can reveal fine-scale differences in composition and potentially help explain variation across these habitats. In particular, little is known about canopy soils, which are unique habitats that are likely to be sources of additional biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling in tropical forests. We studied the effects of diverse tree species and epiphytes on soil metabolomic profiles of forest floor and canopy suspended soils in a French Guianese rainforest. We found that the metabolomic profiles of canopy suspended soils were distinct from those of forest floor soils, differing between epiphyte-associated and non-epiphyte suspended soils, and the metabolomic profiles of suspended soils varied with host tree species, regardless of association with epiphyte. Thus, tree species is a key driver of rainforest suspended soil metabolomics. We found greater abundance of metabolites in suspended soils, particularly in groups associated with plants, such as phenolic compounds, and with metabolic pathways related to amino acids, nucleotides, and energy metabolism, due to the greater relative proportion of tree and epiphyte organic material derived from litter and root exudates, indicating a strong legacy of parent biological material. Our study provides evidence for the role of tree and epiphyte species in canopy soil metabolomic composition and in maintaining the high levels of soil metabolome diversity in this tropical rainforest. It is likely that a wide array of canopy microsite-level environmental conditions, which reflect interactions between trees and epiphytes, increase the microscale diversity in suspended soil metabolomes.

AB  - Forest biodiversity is likely maintained by a complex suite of interacting drivers that vary in importance across both space and time. Contributing factors include disturbance, interannual variation in abiotic variables, and biotic neighborhood effects. To probe ongoing uncertainties and potential interactions, we investigated tree seedling performance in a temperate mid-Atlantic forest ecosystem. We planted seedlings of five native tree species in mapped study plots, half of which were subjected to disturbance, and then monitored seedling survival, height growth, and foliar condition. The final year of data collection encompassed a drought, enabling comparison between intervals varying in water availability. Seedling performance was analyzed as a function of canopy cover and biotic neighborhood (conspecific and heterospecific abundance), including interactions, with separate generalized linear mixed models fit for each interval. All species exhibited: (a) pronounced declines in height growth during the drought year, (b) detrimental effects of adult conspecifics, and (c) beneficial effects of canopy openness. However, despite these consistencies, there was considerable variation across species in terms of the relevant predictors for each response variable in each interval. Our results suggest that drought may strengthen or reveal conspecific inhibition in some instances while weakening it or obscuring it in others, and that some forms of conspecific inhibition may manifest only under particular canopy conditions (although given the inconsistency of our findings, we are not convinced that conspecific inhibition is critical for diversity maintenance in our study system). Overall, our work reveals a complex forest ecosystem that appears simultaneously and interactively governed by biotic neighborhood structure (e.g., conspecific and/or heterospecific abundance), local habitat conditions (e.g., canopy cover), and interannual variability (e.g., drought).

AB  - Climate change, which leads to higher temperatures, droughts, and storms, is expected to have a strong effect on both health of forest trees and associated biodiversity. The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity and composition of fungal communities associated with the functional tissues and rhizosphere soil of healthy-looking Picea abies to better understand these fungal communities and their potential effect on tree health in the process of climate change. The study sites included 30 P. abies stands, where needles, shoots, roots, and the rhizosphere soil was sampled. DNA was isolated from individual samples, amplified using ITS2 rRNA as a marker and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. The sequence analysis showed the presence of 232,547 high-quality reads, which following clustering were found to represent 2701 non-singleton fungal OTUs. The highest absolute richness of fungal OTUs was in the soil (1895), then in the needles (1049) and shoots (1002), and the lowest was in the roots (641). The overall fungal community was composed of Ascomycota (58.3%), Basidiomycota (37.2%), Zygomycota (2.5%), Chytridiomycota (1.6%), and Glomeromycota (0.4%). The most common fungi based on sequence read abundance were Aspergillus pseudoglaucus (7.9%), Archaeorhizomyces sp. (3.6%), and Rhinocladiella sp. (2.0%). Pathogens were relatively rare, among which the most common were Phacidium lacerum (1.7%), Cyphellophora sessilis (1.4%), and Rhizosphaera kalkhoffii (1.4%). The results showed that the detected diversity of fungal OTUs was generally high, but their relative abundance varied greatly among different study sites, thereby highlighting the complexity of interactions among the host trees, fungi, and local environmental conditions.

AB  - In resource management, the kind and extent of ecological co-occurrence between closely related species frequently requires assessment of the spatial relationship among taxa. In my study, analysis of inter-species pair-wise distances revealed no syntopic overlap between Church's sideband (Monadenia churchi) and Trinity bristle snails (M. setosa). No pair of samples had the same geographic coordinates and no parapatric boundary in environmental covariates was evident between species. This "microsympatric" spatial relationship resembled a metapopulation structure with no high degree of overlap, as co-occurrence was rare and small in geographic scope. Fifteen forest cover-types and 82 soil-types were identified between species. The most common forest-type for M. churchi was Sierra Mixed Conifer (39.9%) and Douglas fir (28.9%). In M. setosa the most common forest-types were the same but in much different percentages (78.8% and 14.8%, respectively). Sixty-one and 39 soil-types were associated with samples of M. churchi and M. setosa, respectively. The Hohmann-Neuns family complex was the most common (22.5%) soil-type for M. churchi and the Holland Deep-Hugo family complex was the most (50.6%) dominant for M. setosa. There were significant differences between species in all environmental attributes and in values of monthly temperature and precipitation, which reflected variance in the mesoclimatic regime seasonally. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) accounted for 57.8% of the dispersion contained in environmental variables on the first 3-eigenvectors. Evapotranspiration and Summer and Winter Temperatures loaded positively while Summer and Winter Precipitation and Elevation loaded negatively along PC I (26.2%). Given significant inter-species differences in ecological occupancy, it seems plausible that microsympatry is based in part on both mesoscale habitat variance and subtle differences in mesoclimate defined by seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. The hypothesis that M. setosa is adapted to cool habitats and M. churchi to warmer more arid environs in microsympatry was substantiated at a macroscale level.

AB  - Forest soils have a large capacity of stocking and cycling carbon, incorporated by organic matter and evaded by roots and soil microbiota as CO2. Soil respiration can indicate ecosystem processes, but little is known about the successional, seasonal and diurnal variation in CO2 flux. This study presents estimations of soil CO2 efflux in a seasonal Atlantic forest fragment (FF) and an adjacent 15 years-old restoration site (RS), in two seasons (winter-dry and summer-rainy), during 24-hour periods, in southern Brazil. Measurements were performed with an infrared gas analyser at 2-hour intervals. Respiration rates were 50% higher in the rainy season, both in FF (261, against 135 mg m-2 s-1 in the dry season) and RS (237 and 127 mg m-2 s-1), indicating that higher humidity and temperature promoted higher soil biota activity. The soil respiration was higher at FF only in the dry season, revealing that this environment may be less sensitive to water limitation. Greater overnight respiration was observed in the dry season for both sites, likely reflecting more intense microbial metabolism at night in this season. There was no rainy season diurnal variation. Seasonal and daily variation suggests that soil respiration in the RS is more sensitive to warmer and dryer conditions.

AB  - Antlions and wormlions are distantly related insect taxa, both digging pits in loose soil and ambushing arthropod prey. Their hunting method, which is rare in the animal kingdom, is a clear example of convergent evolution. There is little research directly comparing the 2 pit-building taxa. Using the same experimental platform to investigate how they respond to biotic and abiotic environmental factors enables an examination of their convergence and its limits. We investigated the response of antlions and wormlions to 3 factors common in their daily life: disturbance to the pits, prey arrival, and conspecific competitors. Although both increased the pit size following disturbance, wormlions increased it faster than antlions. Antlions responded to prey faster than wormlions, but wormlions improved their response time over days. The most diverging response was toward conspecifics. Whereas antlions relocated their pits fast in response to increasing conspecific density, wormlions never relocated. We suggest explanations for the behavioral differences between the taxa. Our results imply that despite the similar hunting method of the 2 taxa they may differ greatly in their behavior, which in turn might have consequences for their habitat use and population dynamics.

AB  - In highly diverse tropical landscapes, urban and peri-urban forests can play a crucial role as reservoirs of biodiversity. However, urbanization has negatively impacted the natural and anthropogenic vegetation, including the composition, diversity, and functions of urban forests. Tree regeneration plays an essential role in the long-term functionality of forests. Few studies have investigated how natural regeneration occurs in urbanized tropical landscapes, as well as the factors that drive this process. We assessed whether natural regeneration of the tropical montane cloud forest is occurring in urban and peri-urban forests and examined the influence of environmental factors (elevation, annual precipitation, air temperature, canopy cover, and soil physicochemical characteristics) on the regeneration. We used the density and diversity of seedlings, saplings, and juveniles of trees and shrubs in 42 plots across seven urban and peri-urban sites in the Neotropical city of Xalapa, Mexico. In the natural regeneration, 42 tree and 22 shrub species were recorded. Of these species, 83% were native and 17% were non-native. There was a lower abundance of tree (34%) compared to shrub (66%) individuals. Early-successional species were more abundant (51%) than intermediate (35%) and latesuccessional (14%) species. The numbers of species in the seedling, sapling, and juvenile stages, and the number of early-successional species, were higher in urban than in peri-urban forests. The species richness of both native and non-native taxa was higher in urban than in peri-urban forests (95% CI). We found no significant differences in the density of the young life stages, the density of successional groups, or the density of native and non-native species, between urban and peri-urban forests, probably due to high variability across the sites. Canopy cover had a consistently positive effect on density in most groups. Forest type, soil phosphorus, and soil bulk density also explained densities, except for the late-successional species, where these factors were not statistically significant. The limited richness and density of late-successional species highlight the need to assist the regeneration of this vulnerable group. Understanding natural regeneration patterns can inform the management and restoration of urbanized areas in the distributional regions of tropical montane cloud forest, one of the most important and threatened tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Trees have a strong and species-specific influence on biotic and abiotic properties of the soil. Even after the vegetation is removed, the effect can persist to form so-called soil legacies. We investigated the effects of soil legacies of tree species richness on the emergence and growth of tree seedlings, and how these legacy effects modulate the seedling responses to irrigation frequency.We used a 9-year-old tree plantation on former agricultural land in Belgium, which is part of a biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment (FORBIO). Soil originating from monocultures and four-species plots, with different species combinations, was translocated to a greenhouse. Five tree species (Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus robur, and Tilia cordata) were sown and grown for one growing season in these soils. We performed a watering treatment (low and high irrigation frequency) to measure any potential interaction effects between the soil legacies and irrigation frequency.There was no evidence for soil legacy effects of species richness on plant performance or their response to the irrigation frequency. However, the effect of irrigation frequency was dependent on species identity of the tree seedlings. Despite the lack of clear legacy effects, performance measures did show correlated responses that are likely due to species composition effects.We ascribe these patterns to the young age of the forest and the agricultural past land use. At this early stage in forest development, the land-use history likely has a more important role in shaping soil characteristics that affect plant growth and their response to drought, than species diversity.
   Forest soils originating from experimental stands differing in species richness did not provoke legacy effects on the seedlings' response to irrigation in a pot experiment.image

AB  - Climate change is widely expected to influence geographic distribution and range shifts of plant species. Southwestern China, which has been identified as one of the global biodiversity hotspots, is experiencing a warming trend that is well above the global average. Pinus yunnanensis is a mountainous conifer species endemic to southwestern China. However, little is known about its specific responses to future climate change. Here, based on a maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, we integrated environmental factors, bioclimatic variables, and species occurrence data from extensive field surveys to project the potential suitable habitats of P. yunnanensis for the years 2050 and 2090 under two climate scenarios. According to our projections, P. yunnanensis generally experienced a suitable habitat loss in the coming decades, and there was a clear acceleration of habitat loss with the severity of climate scenarios. Moreover, the suitable habitat of P. yunnanensis showed a slight southward and downslope shift in response to climate change. Our results indicated that temperature-related factors and solar radiation, especially temperature seasonality, lowest temperature in the coldest month, and mean diurnal range, performed better than precipitation and topo-soil factors in explaining species distributional dynamics. In addition, we identified southern Sichuan and north-central Yunnan as long-term refuges for P. yunnanensis under future climate change, while southeastern Tibet should be protected as a priority conservation area. Our results can be used to guide long-term dynamic monitoring and provide a basis for conservation management of this endemic species.

AB  - In West Africa, very poorly documented are the recovery trajectories of secondary forests, and even less is known about the origin of the observed variability in recovery rates. To understand the relative importance of local and regional environmental conditions on these trajectories, we inventoried all trees larger than 2.5 cm DBH on 236 plots (0.2 ha), aged from 0 to 45 years plus controls, on eight chronosequences representing the typical regional North-South climatic gradient of West Africa. In a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we modelled recovery trajectories of biodiversity, aboveground biomass and floristic composition and tested the influence of variability in local (plot history, landscape context, remnant trees) and regional (climate and soil) conditions on recovery rates. Our results show that (a) diversity recovers faster than composition and biomass, (b) among the local variables, the number of remnant trees has a positive impact on recovery rates while the duration of agricultural cultivation has a negative impact, and (c) among the regional variables, the high seasonality of precipitation and climate, typical of the dry forests of the northern West African forest zone, leads to faster secondary successions. Our simulation approaches have indicated that poor regional conditions can be counterbalanced by adequate local conditions and vice versa, which argues strongly in favour of a diagnosis that integrates these two aspects in the choice of more or less active technical itineraries for forest restoration.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF-Glomeromycota) are a group of soil fungi with a widespread occurrence in terrestrial ecosystems where they play important roles that influence plant growth and ecosystem processes. The aim of this paper is to reveal AMF distribution in the Neotropics based on an extensive biogeography database with literature data from the last five decades. All four orders and 11 families were reported in the Neotropics. 221 species (69% of the total number of species for the phylum) were registered in the Neotropics pertaining to 37 genera. Acaulospora, Glomus, Scutellospora, and Funneliformis were the most speciose genera and represented by 47, 29, 15, and 13 species, respectively. Seventy-six species were originally described from Neotropics, which represents 24% of the total diversity of Glomeromycota. The most representative families were Gigasporaceae, Ambisporaceae, and Acaulosporaceae with 89%, 80%, and 79% of species within each family detected in the Neotropics, respectively. AMF were detected in 11 biomes and 52 ecological regions in 19 countries. Biomes with the largest number of species were Tropical and Subtropical Moist Forests (186 species), Tropical and Subtropical Dry Broadleaf forests (127 species), and Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands (124 species), and Jaccard's similarity among them was 53-57%. Mean annual temperature and precipitation were not correlated with total AMF species richness. The Neotropics biomes shelter a large amount of the total diversity of Glomeromycota and studies of occurrence of these fungi should be encouraged considering their importance in maintaining terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Soil provides a key interface between the atmosphere and the lithosphere and plays an important role in food production, ecosystem services, and biodiversity. Recently, demands for applying machine learning (ML) methods to improve the knowledge and understanding of soil behavior have increased. While real-world datasets are inherently imbalanced, ML models overestimate the majority classes and underestimate the minority ones. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of imbalance in training data on the performance of a random forest model (RF). The original dataset (imbalanced) included 6100 soil texture data from the surface layer of agricultural fields in northern Iran. A synthetic resampling approach using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was employed to make a balanced dataset from the original data. Bioclimatic and remotely sensed data, distance, and terrain attributes were used as environmental covariates to model and map soil textural classes. Results showed that based on mean minimal depth (MMD), when imbalanced data was used, distance and annual mean precipitation were important, but when balanced data were employed, terrain attributes and remotely sensed data played a key role in predicting soil texture. Balanced data also improved the accuracies from 44% to 59% and 0.30 to 0.52 with regard to the overall accuracy and kappa values, respectively. Similar increasing trends were observed for the recall and F-scores. It is concluded that, in modeling soil texture classes using RF models through a digital soil mapping approach, data should be balanced before modeling.

AB  - Ongoing and projected changes in climate are expected to alter discharge and water temperature in riverine systems, thus resulting in degraded habitat. Climate adaptation management strategies are proposed to serve as buffers to changes in air temperature and precipitation, with these strategies potentially providing relatively stable protection for flow and thermal regimes. Using a hydrologic and water temperature modeling approach in the Meramec River basin in eastern Missouri, U.S.A., we examined the ability of forested riparian buffers to serve as a useful climate adaptation strategy against ongoing and projected changes in climate. We developed a multi-scale approach using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic and water temperature models as well as a Stream Network Temperature Model (SNTEMP) with different amounts of simulated riparian vegetation to estimate streamflow and water temperature variation within the Meramec River basin under both contemporary and projected future climate conditions. Our results suggest that riparian buffers offer benefits to mitigating increases in water temperature due to shading effects; however, patterns in discharge did not vary substantially based on simulations. From an ecological perspective, the addition of riparian buffers is also projected to reduce the impacts of climate change on Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) by decreasing the number of days water temperatures exceed the thermal tolerance of this species.

AB  - Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of catastrophic events such as hurricanes. Soil microbial communities regulate geochemical cycles and other important ecosystem processes. How the hurricanes affect soil microbial communities and their function, however, is largely unknown. Our aim was to describe the impact of a category 4 hurricane (Patricia) on the soil fungal community structure and diversity in a Mexican tropical dry forest. Soil fungal community was inferred sequencing the ITS2 rDNA of composite soil samples taken in a time series ranging one year before and two years after the hurricane. OTU richness before the hurricane and in the first sampling after were comparable, however a 20-40% decrease in richness was observed in later sampling times. There were also taxonomic shifts associated with the disturbance, changing from a higher richness and abundance of Ascomycota fungi to greater dominance of Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota fungi post hurricane. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and plant pathogens diversity increased immediately after the hurricane but decreased in subsequent years. Approximately 7% of the soil community, primarily composed of saprotrophic fungi, persisted across the hurricane and the harsh seasonality of this ecosystem. Soil fungal community was affected by the hurricane but had function stability and resilience through years.

AB  - Montane cloud forests are fragile biodiversity hotspots. To attain their conservation, disentangling diversity patterns at all levels of ecosystem organization is mandatory. Biotic communities are regularly structured by environmental factors even at small spatial scales. However, studies at this scale have received less attention with respect to larger macroscale explorations, hampering the robust view of ecosystem functioning. In this sense, fungal small-scale processes remain poorly understood in montane cloud forests, despite their relevance. Herein, we analyzed soil fungal diversity and ecological patterns at the small-scale (within a 10 m triangular transect) in a pristine montane cloud forest of Mexico, using ITS rRNA gene amplicon Illumina sequencing and biogeochemical profiling. We detected a taxonomically and functionally diverse fungal community, dominated by few taxa and a large majority of rare species (81%). Undefined saprotrophs represented the most abundant trophic guild. Moreover, soil biogeochemical data showed an environmentally heterogeneous setting with patchy clustering, where enzymatic activities suggest distinctive small-scale soil patterns. Our results revealed that in this system, deterministic processes largely drive the assemblage of fungal communities at the small-scale, through multifactorial environmental filtering.

AB  - Forest stratification plays a crucial role in the interception of light and plants' photosynthetic activities. However, there is still a lack of information on the contribution of tropical forest stratification to its functioning, despite the increasing number of studies. Here, we analysed from a perspective of the whole tree community (WTC) and forest strata (i.e., large trees, understory trees, and small stems), the relationship between abiotic, biotic factors and aboveground Carbon (AGC). The abiotic factors-AGC relationships were positive for all strata and WTC. However, soil factors-AGC relationship was stronger for small stems and understorey, while topography factor-AGC relationship was stronger for large trees and WTC. Tree size inequality-AGC relationship was positive and much stronger for WTC, large trees and small stems. In addition, a species diversity-AGC relationship was found positive only for large trees and WTC. These results highlight the niche complementarity effect for driving positive relationships of species diversity and individual tree size variation with aboveground biomass at large tree strata and WTC. The lack of positive effect of species diversity on AGC for understorey and small stems strata might be attributable to the selection effect or resource complementarity among species.

AB  - Alberta wildfires vary greatly in severity, resulting in a mosaic of burnt, partially burnt, and unburnt forest. These unburnt patches (refugia) within the fire perimeter are critical for the survival of organisms during the fire and the regeneration process. We examined the literature to identify how the fire regimes and landscape features found in Alberta affect the creation and persistence of refugia, the role of refugia for the flora and fauna of Alberta, how climate change is likely to affect refugia, how humans may alter the creation and effectiveness of refugia, and management implications moving forward. Refugia can vary in scale from small areas of unburnt soil or boulders (centimetres to a few metres), to large stands of unburnt trees (many hectares) with different taxa using these refugia across all the spatial scales. Species reliant on habitat connectivity or old growth forest also benefit from refugia as they can use them as stepping-stones between intact habitats or as a lifeboat to recolonize from. The factors influencing what areas remain unburnt are complex and poorly understood but are likely tied to topography, aspect, proximity to waterbodies, weather changes (precipitation and wind direction), time of day during burning, and vegetation type. Areas with the right combination of topography, aspect, and proximity to water have cooler microclimates and higher moisture than the surrounding areas and may remain unburnt throughout multiple fire events, making them persistent refugia. Other areas may remain unburnt by a chance result of weather changes or having the fire pass through at night, making them random refugia. Many of the features that make persistent refugia unlikely to burn (cooler microclimate and higher moisture) will also buffer the effects of climate change. As a result, it is essential we manage the landscape in such a way as to protect areas that act as persistent refugia from industrial activities. In addition, we must restore fire in the landscape to maintain the mosaic of forest caused by mixed-severity fire, especially in the face of climate change, which is projected to increase the severity and frequency of wildfires in Alberta.

AB  - This work considers the influence of climatic factors on the enzymatic activity of different zonal soils of the Northwestern Caucasus-brown forest soils, gray forest soils, and gray forest-steppe soils. A correlation analysis of the relationship strength between climatic parameters and the soil enzymatic activity (catalase, dehydrogenase, invertase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase) has been carried out. The following climatic parameters are used: the average annual temperature, the average monthly temperatures of January and July, the average annual temperature range, the average annual precipitation, and the amount of precipitation during the growing season, as well as indices and coefficients reflecting the combined effects of climatic factors (the Ivanov-Vysotsky humidification coefficient, de Martonne's aridity index, and Gorchinsky index of continentality). A close correlation between the activities of catalase and peroxidase and all the climatic indicators has been established. The dehydrogenase activity depends on the humidity indicators, while the invertase activity, on the contrary, depends to a greater extent on temperature indicators of the climate. The activity of polyphenol oxidase in the upper soil horizons is not affected by the climate; however, the total activity of the entire profile closely depends on it. The values of the biological state integral indicator (BSII) in the soil profile decrease with an increase in precipitation and decrease in temperature. The climate affects not only the upper soil horizons, which are directly exposed to the environment, but the entire soil profile.

AB  - In the context of climate change, it remains unclear whether mixed-species forests will help mitigate the impacts of future droughts and, if so, through which processes. As European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is one of the major European species, it is crucial to evaluate its response to drought when mixed with species with contrasted functional traits and in contrasted climatic conditions, particularly at the limit of its climatic range. This study aimed to (i) characterize the effects of tree species interactions on the drought exposure of beech in south-eastern France, and (ii) determine whether belowground water uptake complementarity underlies these effects. We focused on beech-silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) and beech-pubescent oak (Quercus pubescens Willd.) forests across six sites in the French pre-Alps, a region at the limit of the climatic range for beech. We used a triplet approach to compare the tree-ring carbon isotope composition (delta C-13) of these species in pure and two-species mixed stands during a period of dry years, and used water hydrogen isotope composition (delta H-2) in the xylem to identify water uptake sources. Overall, we found no clear mixture effect pattern on beech physiological functioning among sites and triplets. In beech-fir sites, mixing beech with fir had no effect on beech delta C-13 values during dry years. In beech-oak sites, mixture effects on beech were mostly neutral, although sometimes beech suffered from a stronger exposure to drought in mixed stands. Our study emphasizes the impact of the tree sampling design on the outcome of studies on forest biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. Limiting tree sampling to dominant trees when analyzing stand-level relationships may bias these outcomes. We evidenced differences in water uptake sources between beech and fir, but not between beech and oak during a dry summer. However, these patterns did not help explain the lack of species mixture effects, or existence thereof, at the triplet scale. Our study demonstrates that managing beech in mixed stands with silver fir or pubescent oak at the limit of beech climatic range does not buffer drought impacts on beech during dry years. In the long term, with more frequent extreme droughts, promoting beech-fir mixtures will not be detrimental to beech drought response, while beech may suffer in mixtures with pubescent oak.

AB  - Excessive acid deposition causes soil acidification, and changes the soil microhabitat, thus affecting the survival and reproduction of soil organisms. Folsomia candida (Collembola, Isotomidae), as a model organism, is widely used to assess the chemical toxicity in soil, and its avoidance response can indicate the environmental changes. In this study, we used Folsomia candida to assess the risks of acid deposition on soil ecosystems. Different pH (3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5) treatments were set up in petri dish experiments, and the avoidance behavior of Folsomia candida was measured after 12, 24, and 48 h exposure to the pH conditions. The results indicated that (1) both the exposure duration and pH level influenced avoidance behavior of collembolan. (2) After 12 h exposure, most of the individuals showed avoidance behavior but without significant differences among the treatments. (3) After 24 h exposure, significant avoidance behavior was observed at pH 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0. (4) After 48 h exposure, avoidance behavior was found in all treatment conditions except for pH 5.5. This study clarified the direct responses of soil fauna to acid deposition, and indicated that both pH and length of exposure influenced the avoidance behavior of Folsomia candida. During the experimental period, the collembolan reacted negatively and showed consistent avoidance behavior at pH 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0. Reversed avoidance behavior was apparent between pH 4.5 and 5.0 and not observed at pH 5.5, indicating that the latter was the preferred pH environment. (C) Higher Education Press 2021

AB  - Current widespread and intensive soil degradation in India has been driven by unprecedented levels of population growth, large-scale industrialization, high-yield agriculture, urban sprawl and the spread of human infrastructure. The damage caused to managed and natural systems by soil degradation threatens livelihoods and local services and leads to national socio-economic disruption. Human-induced soil degradation results from land clearing and deforestation, inappropriate agricultural practices, improper management of industrial effluents and wastes, careless management of forests, surface mining, urban sprawl, and ill-planned commercial and industrial development. Of these, inappropriate agricultural practices, including excessive tillage and use of heavy machinery, over-grazing, excessive and unbalanced use of inorganic fertilizers, poor irrigation and water management techniques, pesticide overuse, inadequate crop residue and/or organic carbon inputs, and poor crop cycle planning, account for nearly 40% (121 Mha) of land degradation across India. Globally, human activities related to agriculture contribute to the transgression of four of the nine Planetary Boundaries proposed by Rockstrom et al. (2009): Climate Change, Biodiversity Integrity, Land-system Change, and altered Phosphorus and Nitrogen Biogeochemical Flows. This review focuses on how knowledge of soil processes in agriculture has developed in India over the past 10 years, and the potential of soil science to meet the objectives of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger (End hunger, achieve food security, improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture), using the context of the four most relevant Planetary Boundaries as a framework. Solutions to mitigate soil degradation and improve soil health in different regions using conservation agricultural approaches have been proposed. Thus, in this review we (1) summarize the outputs of recent innovative research in India that has explored the impacts of soil degradation on four Planetary Boundaries (Climate Change, Biodiversity Loss, Land-system Change, and altered Biogeochemical Flows of Phosphorus and Nitrogen) and vice-versa; and (2) identify the knowledge gaps that require urgent attention to inform developing soil science research agendas in India, to advise policy makers, and to support those whose livelihoods rely on the land.

AB  - Not only nature but human activities also provide ecosystem services alike agriculture and agro-forestry which both host a wide range of ecosystem services besides providing food and fiber for humans and animals. The efficiency of ecosystem services of a cultivated land depends on agricultural management choices. Current conventional land management approaches, that are generally unsustainable by causing various environmental problems such as pollution, loss of biodiversity and organic carbon, need to be well-defined for designing land use for agricultural production. This manuscript focuses on tillage and crop-pattern effect on soil organic carbon, which is a vital component not only for enhancing soil quality but for mitigation of climate change and desertification. The monitored plants for 10-year were peach (Prunus persica). apricot (Prunus armeniaca), cherry (Prunus avium L.). quince, pear, plum, grapevine, wheat, barley and pine that are under various land management methods namely tillage, minimum and no-tillage, cover crops, mineral/organic fertilization. The soil organic carbon trends revealed that in the studied semiarid climate zone for rainfed cultivation grapevine, and for irrigated cropping apricot had the highest organic carbon accumulation potential along with optimal C:N ratio.

Here we evaluate one of the pioneering restoration programs in the southern Brazilian Atlantic Forest, where the combination of conservation and restoration efforts has been carried out for 20 years. Specifically, we tested how landscape characteristics, restoration strategies and environmental characteristics affect the results of the restoration of pastures. We established 65 circular plots (total 4.0 ha) along restoration areas (3-10 years) and sampled trees and shrubs composing the canopy (DBH >= 5 cm) and understorey (DBH < 5 cm, height > 1.3 m). We analysed the landscape metrics (proportion of old-growth forests in 200, 500 and 1,000 m buffers around each plot; and area and distance of the nearest-neighbouring old-growth forests). We explored the multiple effects of landscape, restoration strategy (reforestation, natural regeneration) and environmental variables (soil, pasture grass types) on the species composition and multiple diversity metrics of restoration areas. The species composition was very similar among restoration ages and restoration strategies. We found positive and strong effects of old-growth forest (200 m buffer) proportion on the species richness and Shannon diversity (canopy and understorey), above-ground biomass (canopy) and functional diversity (understorey) of restoration areas. The restoration strategies affected forest structure, and, in general, the reforestation strategy increased above-ground biomass, Shannon, functional and phylogenetic diversities (in canopy), and percentage of endemic species and biomass (understorey), when compared to natural regeneration. The 20-year experience in the southern Atlantic Forest showed that programs focused on landscape conservation associated with a mixture of restoration strategies (i.e. natural regeneration in larger areas and active restoration in more disturbed sites), can be an efficient strategy to ensure biodiversity and ecosystem services in tropical landscapes. Synthesis and applications. To manage degraded tropical lands and achieve global targets for biodiversity and ecosystem services, it is necessary to first ensure the conservation of natural remnants and then use multiple restoration strategies in less resilient areas.

AB  - Globally, agricultural land-use negatively affects soil biota that contribute to ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, yet arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are promoted as essential components of agroecosystems. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi include Glomeromycotinian AMF (G-AMF) and the arbuscule-producing fine root endophytes, recently re-classified into the Endogonales order within Mucoromycotina. The correct classification of Mucoromycotinian AMF (M-AMF) and the availability of new molecular tools can guide research to better the understanding of their diversity and ecology. To investigate the impact on G-AMF and M-AMF of agricultural land-use at a continental scale, we sampled DNA from paired farm and native sites across 10 Australian biomes. Glomeromycotinian AMF were present in both native and farm sites in all biomes. Putative M-AMF were favoured by farm sites, rare or absent in native sites, and almost entirely absent in tropical biomes. Temperature, rainfall, and soil pH were strong drivers of richness and community composition of both groups, and plant richness was an important mediator. Both fungal groups occupy different, but overlapping, ecological niches, with M-AMF thriving in temperate agricultural landscapes. Our findings invite exploration of the origin and spread of M-AMF and continued efforts to resolve the phylogeny of this newly reclassified group of AMF.

AB  - Five Hawaiian species of Paratachys Casey are revised, including four newly described: Paratachys terryli from Kauai; P. perkinsi from Moloka'i; P. haleakalae from Maui; and P. aaa from Hawai'i Island. A lec-totype is designated for the fifth Hawaiian species currently combined with Paratachys, Tachys arcanicola Blackburn, 1878 of Oahu. Hawaiian Paratachys spp. known from more than one specimen exhibit some degree of ocular polymorphism, that variation being extreme in P. terryli where individuals range in ocular development from macrophthalmic with broadly convex eyes to microphthalmic with small, flat eyes. All Hawaiian Paratachys species comprise individuals with vestigial wings, with the exception of P. terryli, where a single macropterous, macrophthalmic female complements the other 18 brachypterous speci-mens. Based on a transformation series of characters from the male aedeagus, the biogeographic history of Hawaiian Paratachys is consistent with progressive colonization of the Hawaiian Island chain. Three of the species do not appear to represent species of conservation concern, with P. terryli and P. haleakalae known from terrestrial deep soil, litter, and streamside microhabitats in montane wet rain forest, and the troglobitic P. aaa occupying the dark zone of numerous, recently developed lava tube caves within the Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanic massifs. The conservation status of the other two species is much more dire, with P. arcanicola of O'ahu not seen in nature since the early 20th Century, and P. perkinsi known only from a single specimen fortuitously collected in 1894 near sea level on Moloka'i.

FX  - As Terry Erwin exemplified, all biological research begins in the field, in direct contact with nature. This particular study was made possible by collaboration with colleagues eager and willing to conduct sometimes grueling field work, including David H. Kavanaugh (Kauai 1991), Arthur C. Medeiros, Jr. (Haleakala, Maui 1991), and Curtis P. Ewing, Dan A. Polhemus, and Andrew E. Z. Short (Kauai 2005). Martha Erickson is thanked for her gracious hospitality during the 1991 field trip to Kauai. The productive 2005 expedition to Namolokama Mountain, Kauai was enhanced by access to the facilities of the Souza Center, Hui o Laka Koke`e, located in Koke`e State Park. Additionally, I acknowledge the immense, laborious, and productive contributions of cavers who have accrued the wide-ranging samples of Paratachys aaa described above. These efforts were pioneered by Francis G. Howarth, with later assistance by Scott E. Miller (BPBM). More recently, a new generation of cavers headed by Christy A. M. Slay (The Sustainability Consortium), Michael E. Slay (The Nature Conservancy), and Megan Porter (University of Hawai`i, Manoa) have explored the biodiversity of numerous lava tubes, expanding our knowledge of the distribution and biology of P. aaa. I thank them and the members of The Cave Conservancy of Hawaii for their continuing efforts to survey and protect lava tube caves in Hawai`i. Terry also valued natural history museums as essential guardians of the specimens representing living biodiversity, expending vast efforts to organize collections and provide information on them to colleagues. This study called on curators from various museums for assistance with loans and information on types. I thank Dave Kavanaugh (CAS), James Boone (BPBM), and Thierry Deuve (MNHN) for access to material, and Beulah Garner similarly for access, but additionally for answering numerous questions concerning the historical treatment of natural history specimens in The Natural History Museum, London. I also thank M. E. Bacchus for educating me on the labelling conventions and wartime history of the NHMUK. This paper benefited from Arnaud Faille's informed and thought-provoking review, and additional information regarding Paratachys terryli from Luca Toledano's personal collection (CTVR). This research was supported by awards DEB-9208269, DEB-9806349, and DEB-0315504 from the U.S. National Science Foundation.

AB  - Hurricanes defoliate canopy and break tree branches and stems, generating large amount of plant debris in forest ecosystems. Forest recovery after hurricane disturbances relies heavily on the decomposition of these plant debris. Here we addressed the "tropical hierarchy of factors" hypothesis that substrate quality replaces climate as the predominant control on plant litter decomposition in tropical forests. We compared leaf decomposition between subtropical rain and dry forests on the island of Puerto Rico by reciprocally transplanting green-leaf litter between rain (Eugenia borinquensis leaves with higher C/N) and dry (Bucida buceras leaves with lower C/ N) forests following hurricanes Irma and Maria. We show that leaf decomposed substantially faster in subtropical rain than dry forests, and for high-than low-quality substrates. Over a period of 536 days of field incubation, loss of leaf ash-free dry mass was 51.8% for B. buceras and 26.6% for E. borinquensis in the rainforest, 15.7% for B. buceras and near zero for E. borinquensis in the dry forest. We also found that soil arthropod density was more than 10-folds greater in the rainforest than in the dry forest and was only more than 2-folds greater in the low C/ N litterbags than the high C/N litterbags. Analyses of structural equation model revealed that leaf decomposition rate correlated positively with total arthropod abundance in the rainforest and only with Oribatida abundance in the dry forest. The number of effective linkages among leaf C/N, precipitation and arthropods was greater in the subtropical rainforest (19) than in the dry forest (4), but did not vary between B. buceras (12) and E. borinquensis (11) substrates in the rainforest. We conclude that climate, rather than substrate quality, remains to be the predominant control on leaf decomposition across subtropical rain and dry forests following hurricane disturbances, and the controls of substrate quality on leaf decomposition is inferior and climate dependent.

AB  - Background The northern metalmark (Calephelis borealis), is an exceedingly local, globally rare butterfly that is declining across the Midwestern and Northeastern USA. The two principal stressors driving colony losses include afforestation and invasive plants that crowd out its larval hostplant (Packera ovata) and nectar resources. Aims/methods To better understand its declines and guide restoration efforts, we (1) performed a mark-recapture study in Connecticut to document population trends where we were actively managing vegetation; (2) conducted a range-wide survey for evidence of phylogeographic structure, using cytochrome oxidase (CO1); (3) investigated abundance determinants of its larval foodplant, Packera ovata; and (4) visited northern metalmark populations across the Northeastern USA to identify common edaphic, structural, and community elements of its colonies. Results We document that the species is increasing at a managed colony in Connecticut, where we opened the canopy, removed invasive plants, and added nectar resources. Common habitat attributes in the Northeastern USA include limestone soil, eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), and ecotonal woodland structure that allows its shade-loving, larval hostplant (Packera obovata) to be spatially proximate to sun-loving, nectar resources. Nectar limitation is hypothesized to be a driver of colony location and success. Implications for insect conservation Our results underscore how active plant management (canopy thinning, invasive plant removal, and the addition of nectar plants) was able to rescue an imperiled woodland butterfly, reinforce the increasingly recognized importance of nectar resources in butterfly conservation, and demonstrate how metapopulation structure can buffer against the vagaries of precipitation and other (increasingly variable) climatic factors.

AB  - Context. Human-induced changes in climate and land cover have altered the distribution of fauna around the globe. Some reptiles have been found to be vulnerable to these changes; therefore, studies to identify the impact of the changes on other groups of reptiles are necessary. Aims. We aimed to study the impact of climate and land cover change on the yellow monitor (Varanus flavescens) in Nepal. We also aimed to identify the current distribution range and predict the potential distribution under multiple climate change, corresponding land cover change, and dispersion scenarios in the near-and mid-future. Methods. We used available presence locations with a candidate set of the least-correlated environmental variables and an Ensemble of Small Models (ESM), a Species Distribution Model (SDM) approach suitable for species with small sample size. Additionally, dispersal scenarios of 1 km, 5 km, and 10 km were added to the model to determine the future distribution under the dispersal scenarios. Key results. We found soil particle size, distance to forest, precipitation of wettest quarter, bulk density, and elevation were the five most important variables contributing to the distribution of the species. The Terai lowland and wide valleys in Outer Himalayas are currently suitable but are expected to experience a substantial decrease under most future climate projections and dispersal scenarios. Conclusions. The distribution is mostly dependent on soil-related variables; however, climatic variables might have a greater impact on future suitability. Implications. Limiting emissions contributing to climatic changes, conserving the soil outside the protected areas, and the potential areas where the species will not experience habitat loss might contribute to the conservation of the species.

AB  - Concentrated flow erosion in Mediterranean cultivated areas is considered a major process of land degradation. Rills and ephemeral gullies in a 6.4 ha olive orchard catchment located in an intensive commercial farm, which could represent a common degradation scenario in hilly areas, were measured and compared with the sediment loads at the outlet. Four GPS survey campaigns were carried out between March 2009 and March 2014, for periods with cumulative precipitation ranging between 728 and 121 mm. Chopped pruning residues were kept on the lanes during campaigns 2-4, whereas a grass cover crop was seeded in campaign 4. Rainfall, runoff and sediment loads were measured in a flume gauge station at the catchment outlet.
   The ratio of concentrated flow erosion to catchment sediment load varied between 1.0 and 35.0. Total concentrated flow erosion ranged between 25.0 and 0.1 t ha(-1). Rill erosion was the dominant process on ephemeral gullies for three campaigns, with a mean contribution to the total concentrated flow erosion of 55%. Rills clearly followed tractor tracks along the most parallel lanes to the maximum slope. Therefore, a change in traffic direction would be helpful to reduce the connectivity, controlled by the spatial distribution of rows and lanes in the farm. Olive plantation distributions should prioritize hydrological criteria to adapt traffic patterns in olive farms, as long as the tractor manoeuvrability and risk of overturning are not adversely affected.
   Although the farmer only kept the cover crop for one campaign, it proved to be an efficient measure for interrupting rills along the lanes, whereas pruning residues were effective for the control of interrill erosion. On-site application of pruning residues reduced their handling and transport costs, while increasing the soil fertility and soil cover. However, guidelines for the efficient application of pruning residues are still necessary in terms of residue rates and orientation.

AB  - With rising temperatures and altered annual precipitation patterns, climatic factors are likely to play an increasingly important role in controlling the biomass accumulation rate of tropical secondary forests. However, the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors and demographic progresses (growth, mortality, and recruitment) driving biomass dynamics in these ecosystems remain largely unclear, especially in tropical Asia. We explored aboveground biomass (AGB) dynamics in old-growth and secondary tropical forests on Hainan Island, China, across two consecutive five-year intervals (2010-2020). Drought frequency was higher in the second vegetation census interval. We studied the relationships of AGB and its three demographic components with drought frequency, tree diversity, soil nutrient and microorganismal abundance, and successional stage. We found that AGB accumulation rate decreased as AGB increased gradually during secondary succession. The different drought frequency between the two intervals was the dominant factor predicting the net change of AGB. With high-frequency droughts, the loss of AGB intensified and the increment rate of AGB decreased, especially in old-growth forests during second interval (2015-2020). Considering the impact of the three demographic pro-gresses on net change in AGB, the relative influence of mortality was the largest (61.1%), followed by growth (38.3%) and recruitment (0.6%). Successional stage was another major factor affecting AGB and its dynamics, showing a positive relationship with AGB stock and a negative relationship with net AGB change. Species richness and fungal richness had a significant positive association with AGB, while soil available nutrient had a significant negative relationship. Overall, our results show that drought frequency had a strong impact on AGB dynamics, and that the resilience of AGB accumulation to drought decreased in later successional stages. Thus, with the intensification of global climate change, the effects of high-frequency drought events should be taken into account when studying the factors affecting AGB recovery in tropical secondary forests.

AB  - Protecting the tropical peat swamp forests in Southeast Asia is critical for addressing global sustainability challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. However, more than half of these forests have been lost since 1990 due to the rapid expansion of drainage-based agriculture and forestry. Within the oil palm sector, the number of regional smallholder oil palm plantings on peat soils has risen quickly. These activities are challenging to govern and manage, due to their fragmented nature and the numerous farmers involved. It is imperative to understand the spatial distribution and drivers of the smallholder oil palm-related conversion of peat swamp forests. In contrast to existing studies based on farm surveys, we used state-of-art maps of smallholder oil palm plantings, derived from 2019 remote sensing data. Spatial data about socioeconomic and biophysical factors (e.g. mills, roads, water ways, and concessions) was then used to develop logistic regression models to investigate the relative influence of these factors. We show that the spatial patterns of smallholder oil palm plantings are distinct from those of industrial oil palm plantations, revealing the critical roles of roads, especially service roads, residential roads and tracks, in driving smallholder oil palm expansion within peatlands. We found that 90% of smallholder oil palm areas were located within 2 km of roads and 25 km of mills. The mean likelihood of a given land area being converted from peat swamp forests to smallholder oil palm declined rapidly with increasing distance from roads and mills. In addition to roads and mills, land use zones (e.g. the setting of concessions and migration settlements) and other environmental factors (e.g. precipitation and elevation) were identified as important drivers of smallholder oil palm expansion on peatland. Based on these findings, we identify priority regions for the protection of the remaining peat swamp forests in Indonesia and discuss strategies for tackling these sustainability challenges on local and global scales.

AB  - Nematodes are important components of soil food webs and have important ecosystem functions. However, the responses of soil nematode communities to nitrogen (N) deposition have not been well assessed over large spatial scales. Here, we conducted a global-scale meta-analysis of the effects of N-addition regimes (N form, N addition approach, and N addition rate) and environmental factors (ecosystem type, soil depth, climate, and soil property) on the responses of soil nematodes to N addition. The results showed that N addition significantly increased the relative abundance of bacterial-feeding nematodes (23.54%), but decreased the relative abundance of plantfeeding nematodes (-20.24%) and omnivorous-predatory nematodes (-22.28%). Nitrogen addition, however, did not significantly affect total nematode abundance or the relative abundance of fungal-feeding nematodes. Understory N addition usually had larger effects on nematode abundance than canopy N addition. The responses to N addition increased with N addition rate in the case of bacterial-feeding nematode abundance, but decreased with N addition rate in the case of plant-feeding nematode and fungal-feeding nematode abundances. Nematode abundance in grasslands were more responsive to N addition than in forests or croplands, and the responses were affected by soil depth. The response ratios of bacterial-feeding nematodes to N addition decreased with increases in mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation, while the response ratios of plant-feeding nematodes showed the opposite trend. Soil pH and organic carbon did not affect the response ratios of nematode parameters to N addition except plant parasite index. In summary, the responses of soil nematodes to N addition on a global scale were found to be affected by both N-addition regimes and environmental factors. We suggest that our understanding of how N deposition affects soil nematodes will be increased by additional studies of canopy N addition and of tropical ecosystems.

AB  - The West Coast of Ireland hosts many of the few populations of Freshwater Peal Mussels (FPM) left in Europe. The decline of this keystone species is strongly related to deteriorating hydrological conditions, specifically to the threat of low flows during dry summers. Populations still capable of reproducing require a minimum discharge and flow velocity to support juvenile mussels, or else stress builds up and an entire generation may be lost. Monitoring environmental and hydrological conditions in small and remote FPM catchments is difficult due to the lack of infrastructure. Indices derived from remote sensing imagery can be used to assess hydrological variables at the catchment scale. Here, five indices are tested as possible surrogates for soil moisture and evapotranspiration, based on two relevant land-cover types: open peat habitats (OPH) and forestry. Selected indices are then assessed in their ability to reproduce seasonal patterns and in their response to a severe drought event. The moisture stress index (MSI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were found to be the best surrogates for soil moisture and evapotranspiration respectively. Both indices showed seasonality patterns in the two land cover types, although the variability of MSI was significantly higher. During the 2018 drought, MSI visibly increased only in OPH, while NDVI rose only for forestry. The results suggest that OPH enhances the long-term hydrological resilience of a catchment by conserving water in the peat substrate, while industrial forestry plantations exacerbate the pressure on water during drier periods. This has consequences for river discharge, freshwater biodiversity and specifically for FPM. Implementing these surrogates have the potential to identify land-use management strategies that reduce and even avert the effects of drought on FPM. Such strategies are increasingly necessary in a climate change context, as recurring summer droughts are expected in most of Europe. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Community trait assembly in highly diverse tropical rainforests is still poorly understood. Based on more than a decade of field measurements in a biodiversity hotspot of southern Ecuador, we implemented plant trait variation and improved soil organic matter dynamics in a widely used dynamic vegetation model (the Lund-Potsdam-Jena General Ecosystem Simulator, LPJ-GUESS) to explore the main drivers of community assembly along an elevational gradient. In the model used here (LPJ-GUESS-NTD, where NTD stands for nutrient-trait dynamics), each plant individual can possess different trait combinations, and the community trait composition emerges via ecological sorting. Further model developments include plant growth limitation by phosphorous (P) and mycorrhizal nutrient uptake. The new model version reproduced the main observed community trait shift and related vegetation processes along the elevational gradient, but only if nutrient limitations to plant growth were activated. In turn, when traits were fixed, low productivity communities emerged due to reduced nutrient-use efficiency. Mycorrhizal nutrient uptake, when deactivated, reduced net primary production (NPP) by 61-72% along the gradient. Our results strongly suggest that the elevational temperature gradient drives community assembly and ecosystem functioning indirectly through its effect on soil nutrient dynamics and vegetation traits. This illustrates the importance of considering these processes to yield realistic model predictions.

AB  - Soil organic matter (OM) is a source of fertility for food provisioning and a means for climate mitigation. A high pedodiversity observed over very short distances due to both past and present land use, such as in Western Africa (Northern Togo), makes this a crucial issue. In particular, some small spots covered by sacred forests (forets sacrees) of high cultural value in this area are extremely biodiverse, calcareous and high in OM in contrast with the non-calcareous, poor OM, overgrazed woody savannah and agricultural surroundings. The objectives of our work were to understand this pedodiversity and the process of CaCO3 formation in the soil under the highly biodiverse forest using morphological, micromorphological, chemical and mineralogical soil analyses. The results show a high degree of weathering of the gneiss parent material, presence of plinthite gravels, dominance of 1:1 clays, formation of swelling clays in the imperfectly drained soils, and low OM content. The presence of palygorskite, although in traces, suggests drier intervals and is consistent in this context with the extreme wet and dry climate conditions in the region. In the OM rich soils under forest, bio-calcification takes place in the form of CaCO3 needles, micrite hypocoatings around biopores and calcified cells. Oribatid excrements are associated with calcite and organic matter in the sacred forest soil, indicating that litter recycling has played an important role in the formation of calcite. We hypothesize that the high biological activity releasing CO2, formation of HCO3- and precipitation of CaCO3 due to the Ca2+ released by the recycled organic matter and weathering of plagioclases, lead to different forms of secondary calcium carbonate in the sacred forest soils. The high oxalate content of the vegetation in the sacred forest suggests that calcium carbonate formation, possibly via the oxalate-carbonate pathway, may also have played a role in calcite precipitation in these in organic matter rich soils. The parent material of these soils is not calcareous, meaning that these are not lithogenic carbonates, thus making them an important carbon sink. The soil characteristics indicate a high potential for development of the soils of the area in both agricultural yields and in potential carbon sequestration relevant to global change policies.

AB  - Due to the Aichi targets, the international community committed to the sustainable management of silvoagricultural activities and to the elimination or reform of detrimental subsidies relative to biodiversity conservation. In this context, countries should have implemented specific actions to address these commitments. In Chile, the Instruments of Productive Promotion to Finance Field Work (IPP-FFW) framework was used to fund activities related to silvoagricultural systems, including, irrigation, plantations with exotic species, and the recovery of soils. However, concerns have been raised that are associated with the need for evaluating their effectiveness, including whether impact assessments should be carried out systematically. Considering that these subsidized activities may negatively impact nature, whether IPP-FFWs had been allocated is analyzed regardless of the threat degree of terrestrial ecosystems at the commune level in Chile using the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ecosystem risk assessment methodology; moreover, the eventual relationship between changes in land use and ecosystem service provisions in case study for the Biobio region in Chile is also examined, for which the monetary consequences of the loss of ecosystem services-via the analysis of benefit transfers-are calculated. Evidence reveals that higher amounts of IPP-FFWs are allocated in communes with higher levels of threats and that a decrease in ecosystem service provision is associated with IPP-FFW's allocation.

AB  - Tropical ecosystems play an important role in the environment. They provide multiple ecosystem services, such as carbon capture and sequestration, food supply, and climate regulation. Studying land use and land cover change makes it possible to understand the land's alterations associated with deforestation, degradation, erosion, soil desertification, and biodiversity loss. The objective of this study is to evaluate the different approaches to land use and land cover research in tropical forests based on the evolutionary and qualitative analysis of the last 44 years of scientific production. The data were collected using the Scopus database and was based on the PRISMA methodology's four phases: (i) identification, (ii) screening, (iii) eligibility, and (iv) included. The results showed a significant increase in the study of land use and land cover consolidated in 4557 articles, with contributions from 74 countries, revealing 14 themes and seven lines of research. Core research areas such as biodiversity, land use, and conservation exist due to the ongoing interest in the value of tropical forests and their response to climate change. The present research allowed us to consider future study topics such as the relationship between sustainable development goals and land use and cover in tropical forests, as well as the evaluation of the environmental impact of economic activities in forests.

AB  - Restoring forest ecosystems to reverse soil degradation is critical to maintain environmental quality, forest and agricultural productivity, biodiversity conservation, and to provide valuable ecosystem services. Yet the impacts of forest restoration on soil quality remain under-investigated. Here we aim to address a key knowledge gap: how does forest ecosystem restoration affect the recovery of soil quality in tropical and temperate regions? We conducted a global meta-analysis to compare soil physical, chemical, and biological properties between restoring forests and reference old-growth/less-disturbed forests. We revealed for the first time that differences between restoring and reference forests are lower for physical (12-25%; based on median values of effect size) and chemical (10-74%) properties than for biological (32-90%) properties. More specifically, bulk density (12% of difference), pH (10%), and enzyme activity (32%) had mean values in restoring forests closer to those observed in reference forests. Overall, our results suggest that the restoration of soil properties was greater in tropical regions, after longer periods (>30 years), through passive restoration, and over pasturelands. Our global meta-analysis helps to fill the soil information gap in forest restoration and increase our understanding of how to improve soil quality through forest restoration and soil monitoring processes in tropical and temperate regions.

AB  - The high biodiversity of the Amazon region is related to variation in soil physical properties and water-table depths. Dung beetles are efficient bioindicators that feed and breed on the soil surface and below ground, affecting soil properties and being affected by them. Here, we investigate the influence of soil physical characteristics (proportions of sand, silt, clay) and water-table depth on dung beetle assemblages and functional groups in a forest in central Amazonia. We sampled beetles in 29 transects with different soil physical properties and water-table maximum levels, and analyzed beetle species richness, abundance and species composition for the total assemblage and for each functional group (rollers, tunnellers, dwellers). Dung beetle abundance increased with soil clay content (GLMM; p = 0.009) whereas dweller (GLMM; p = 0.017) and tunneller species richness increased with clay and silt contents (GLMM; p = 0.018). Sites with deeper water table had greater roller-beetle abundance (GLMM; p = 0.049). Dung beetle assemblage composition was strongly influenced by clay content. Our results suggest that soil texture and water-table levels determine dung beetle distributions, both for the whole assemblages and for each functional group separately. These findings highlight the role of soil structure in determining dung beetle assemblages.

AB  - Nematodes play a significant role in soil biogeochemical cycling. However, our understanding of their community carbon budget response for a shift in the environmental conditions of natural and planted forests is limited. Therefore, we investigated the nematode community composition, daily carbon used in production and daily carbon budget, environmental variables, and the interaction among trophic groups in the moss, litter and 0-5 cm soil layers of natural subalpine spruce forest and plantations in western Sichuan, China. The result revealed that plantations increased the total nematode daily carbon budget by approximately 52% through the herbivore channel in the 0-5 cm soil layer. The herbivorous nematodes' daily carbon budget and production in the moss layer of plantations decreased by approximately 60% compared to natural forests. Nematode daily carbon used in production and carbon budget had a strong negative correlation with genus richness. The water content and total carbon was the most important environmental factor that affected the nematode carbon budget and production, respectively. However, the environmental factors indirectly affect the daily carbon budget of herbivore nematodes through omnivore top-down control in subalpine forest ecosystems. Our findings highlight that the planted ecosystems have a certain capacity to maintain abundance, richness, and carbon budget of soil nematode but increase the risk of herbivorous pests.

AB  - The decomposition of litter from forest tree species is a fundamental process in the carbon (C) cycle of terrestrial ecosystems and is closely related to ongoing climate change. However, the spatial distribution of the forest litter decomposition rate (k) and its potential response to changing air temperature (temperature sensitivity) remain poorly understood. Here, we estimated the spatial pattern of forest plant k values in China by performing a random forest model based on 433 standardized k values from 124 published studies. Nine potential predictors, including climate-related factors, vegetation characteristics, and soil physical and chemical factors, were considered in the model. The results of spatial extrapolation indicated that the average k value for China's forests was 0.53, and the mean annual temperature (MAT) was the most important factor. We also mapped the spatial pattern of the temperature sensitivity of the k value (Q(10)) by using a moving window method. We found that the Q(10) values had considerable variation (from 0.05 to 11.68, 95% confidence interval, CI) across forest types and regions. The Q(10) values were lower in the warmer regions (primarily in the sub-tropical evergreen forests) and higher in the semi-humid regions (primarily in the temperate deciduous forests and boreal Larix forests) than those in the other regions of China. However, the Q(10) values of the broadleaved forests were higher than those of coniferous forests. These results suggest that the temperature sensitivity of the litter decomposition rate will decline under the ongoing global warming. Changing patterns of precipitation will also affect not only the forest litter decomposition rate but also its temperature sensitivity.

AB  - Plant biomass storage and its allocation reflect the ecosystem productivity and adaptation to different environments. Understory vegetation is a significant component of any forest ecosystem and plays a vital role in biodiversity maintenance and the ecosystem's carbon cycle. Although many studies have addressed the relationships of climate, stand structure and resource availability with understory biomass and its allocation at local scales, the large-scale variation of understory biomass and allocation and their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We compiled a large database of understory biomass at the community level across China's forests to explore the large-scale patterns of understory biomass and R/S ratio, and to quantify the relative importance of drivers. Understory biomass and R/S ratio varied largely with forest types, and decreased with increasing longitude, but increased with elevation. Understory biomass increased with increasing latitude, mean annual temperature (MAT), and mean annual precipitation (MAP), while the R/S ratio decreased with latitude, MAT, and MAP. Stand structure had a strong effect on the variations in understory biomass. MAP was the most important driver in determining R/S ratio. This synthesis provides a first assessment of the large-scale patterns of understory biomass and allocation and sheds new light on the mechanisms underlying the variations in understory biomass and its allocation over a broad geographic scale. These findings will improve predictions of understory community dynamics in response to climate change and aid in further optimizing ecosystem process models. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Global modeling of carbon storage and sequestration often mischaracterizes unique ecosystems such as the seasonally dry tropical forest of the central region of the Gulf of Mexico, because species diversity is usually underestimated, as is their carbon content. In this study, aboveground and soil carbon stocks were estimated to determine the climate mitigation potential of this highly degraded landscape (<25% of forest cover). Results: Tree species in the study area had carbon content values that were 30%-40% higher than the standard value proposed by the IPCC (i.e., 50%). Tropical oak forest in the region, despite its restricted distribution and low species richness, accounted for the highest mean carbon stocks per unit area. The main factors driving spatial variability in carbon stocks were: maximum precipitation, soil organic matter, clay and silt content. No strong relationship was found between aboveground carbon stocks and soil organic carbon in the study area. Quantification of carbon stocks is an important consideration in the assessment of the conservation value of remnants of native vegetation in human-modified landscapes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of the highly fragmented tropical dry regions of the Neotropics in maintaining landscape functionality and providing key ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. Our results also highlight how crucial field-based studies are for strengthening the accuracy of global models. Furthermore, this approach reveals the real contribution of ecosystems that are not commonly taken into account in the mitigation of climate change effects.

AB  - Exploring the spatiotemporal distribution and interrelationships among water-related ecosystem services (WESs) and conducting ecological management zoning are crucial for regional sustainable development. Taking the Xiangjiang River Basin (XJRB) as an example, this study first quantified three primary WESs, including water conservation, soil retention, and water purification, from 2000 to 2020. Second, the spatiotemporal variation in the interrelationships among WESs were analyzed using global and local bivariate spatial autocorrelation. Third, a water ecological zoning rule was constructed to divide the watershed into three primary and eight secondary water ecological management zones. The results indicate a strong consistency in the changes in the three WESs throughout the period from 2000 to 2020 in the XJRB. Precipitation patterns and urban expansion were the primary factors affecting alterations in the WESs. Spatial heterogeneity and dependence were evident across these ecosystem services. Both trade-offs and synergies were observed among WESs, with synergies playing a dominant role. Positive synergies occurred primarily in woodlands and grasslands, while negative synergies were observed in cultivated land, water areas, and construction land. Three water ecological management zones, including core water ecological management zones, general management zones, and restoration management zones, were delineated at the grid and country scales according to the aggregation properties of the WESs. Ecological management strategies were proposed for different zones. These findings can offer valuable insights for policy makers in land use planning and water ecological management within the XJRB, and can facilitate similar management endeavors in other regions.

AB  - We evaluated the influence of soil properties, climate, and space on the distribution of herbaceous-shrub species in the Cerrado biome. We determined species composition, cover, and richness along 25 line transects in Cerrado (savanna-like vegetation) in three protected areas with different soil types and altitudes. Soil physicochemical properties, climate, and geographic coordinates were included in the analysis as species distribution predictors. We observed high species richness in all sites, especially in the Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park (PNCV) and the Brasilia National Park (PNB), with over 200 species each. Only 16% of the species were recorded in all sites, indicating high species turnover for Cerrado herbaceous-shrub layer. The transformation-based redundancy analysis indicated that differences in the herbaceous-shrub flora were associated with soil physicochemical properties and climate. Species composition was primarily influenced by higher annual precipitation for PNCV, by the highest clay content and soil pH for PNB, and by greater annual mean temperature for Terra Ronca State Park (PETER). Soil, climate, and their spatially structured fraction explained herbaceous-shrub species distribution in the Cerrado (43.6%). The spatial variation which is not correlated to the environment adds only 4.5% to the model. Taken together, our findings provide a basis for understanding the distribution patterns of herbaceous-shrub species across climate, soil, and geographic distance. These findings are critical for the development of strategies to protect biodiversity and endangered species in the Cerrado, especially in the region most threatened by deforestation (PETER).

AB  - Having a comprehensive understanding of genetic differentiation, responses to environmental change and demographic history is critical for genetic improvement and conservation efforts. Forest trees are an excellent resource for understanding population differentiation and adaptive genetic variation due to their ability to adapt to different climates and environments. Cephalotaxus oliveri is a relict conifer endemic to China. In this study, we generated transcriptome data and identified 17 728 high-quality single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 18 populations. We found significant negative correlations between expression diversity and nucleotide diversity within and among populations, suggesting that gene expression and nucleotide diversity have a reciprocal relationship when the species adapts to the environment. The analyses of population structure showed that C. oliveri displayed a striking genetic structure with four groups. BayeScEnv and RDA methods detected the signatures of local adaptation, and identified that 738 outlier SNPs were associated with precipitation, temperature and soil conditions across heterogeneous environmental conditions. Approximate Bayesian computation analyses showed that the first and second divergence occurred in the late Miocene (c. 10.075 million years ago [Ma]) and the middle Pleistocene transition (c. 0.815 Ma), respectively. Ecological niche modeling of C. oliveri revealed signs of westward expansion after the last glacial maximum, while it was predicted to experience significant range contractions in future climate change scenarios. Geographical factors and environmental factors in southern China have played a critical role in establishing the current genetic diversity and population structure of C. oliveri. This study provides an important reference for forest resource management and conservation for C. oliveri.

AB  - Aim Although some long-term studies have been conducted to quantify the impacts of nitrogen (N) on plant productivity, uncertainties remain regarding whether these impacts change over time and the underlying mechanisms. By overlooking this, we might over- or underestimate the impacts of N on terrestrial ecosystems. Our goal was to determine whether the impacts of N on plant productivity change in the long term and what controls these dynamics. Location Global. Time period 1999-2018. Major taxa studied Effects of N on plant productivity. Methods We synthesized 63 N addition studies with duration >= 8 years in natural terrestrial ecosystems. Results Our results showed temporally dynamic impacts of N on plant productivity in terrestrial ecosystems. The interannual coefficient of variation (CV) of N impacts ranged from 19 to 768% across 63 studies, with higher variability in acidic soils. Moreover, a substantial proportion (44%) of studies showed evidence of a consistent directional change in the strength of the impacts of N over time. The direction of change varied with biome type (forests, decrease; grasslands and shrublands, increase). The temporal pattern of the impacts of N was mostly responsive to mean annual precipitation (MAP), mean annual temperature (MAT) and initial soil pH, which accounted for 24%, 19% and 19% of the variation, respectively. Main conclusions Our findings indicate that temporally dynamic impacts of long-term N addition on plant productivity and large fluctuations of the impacts of N between years are generally observed among studies in terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, not only the magnitude of N impacts on plant productivity, but also their temporal pattern and variability should be considered in future experimental and model research.

AB  - Biological nitrogen (N) fixation is an essential N input into terrestrial ecosystems and plays a critical role in global N cycling. However, the driving factors of the diazotrophic community composition and soil N fixation rate at the regional scale remain largely unclear, especially in different land-use types. Here, we explored the environmental adaptation of diazotrophic communities and controlling factors of N fixation in maize, rice, and forest soils across eastern China. Results showed that the diversity, composition, and co-occurrence network differed significantly among these habitats, with a relatively higher alpha diversity and network complexity in rice fields. The mean annual precipitation plays a predominant role in shaping diazotrophic community composition. Dispersal limitation, belonging to stochastic processes, contributed most to diazotrophic commu-nity assembly in terrestrial ecosystems. Habitat niche breadth analysis indicated that the environmental adap-tation of diazotrophic communities was highest in rice fields, followed by forest and maize fields. The overall N fixation rate was higher in rice fields, followed by maize and forest soils. Structural equation modeling revealed that the N fixation rate was mainly affected by soil properties in maize and forest soils. In contrast, the N fixation rate was more influenced by diazotrophic community composition and climatic factors in rice habitats. Our results revealed that the environmental adaptation of the diazotrophic communities and controlling factors of the N fixation function were different among maize, rice, and forest ecosystems. These findings will help us un-derstand and predict the N bioavailability in different ecosystem types under climate changes.

AB  - Abiotic stresses, physiological dysfunction, forest stand dynamics and primary tree attackers (native and non-native) are all recognized as important contributors to both anomalous tree mortality and background tree mortality, and thus as important influences on biogeochemical cycling and habitat for associated terrestrial organisms. Opportunistic and latent tree pathogens and insect pests have largely been left out of this discussion, probably because they are difficult to monitor and their effects sometimes more diffuse, yet they play important roles in tree mortality scenarios. We know very little about the influence of biotic gradients, for example, forest dynamics and forest structure, on the occurrence and effects of these opportunistic biotic enemies. To better understand the influence of an important biotic gradient-forest structure as represented by tree density and competition-on the occurrence and distribution of a typical opportunistic pathogen, we analysed the relationship between tree neighbourhood competition and soil-dwelling rhizomorphs of the fungus Armillaria gallica in regenerating (20-year-old) and mature (80- to 100-year-old) hardwood-dominated forest stands in central Missouri following a severe drought. We detected A. gallica rhizomorphs in twice as many sampling sites in young (dense) plots as in mature (open) plots, and by contrast found a twofold occurrence of other saprophytic fungi in the soil of mature plots compared to young plots. Mean tree density and competition index were significantly higher in subplots where A. gallica was found than in those with no A. gallica detections, and the pattern of A. gallica occurrence tracked closely with the occurrence of dense 'hotspots' of competition in the plots. Synthesis. Early stages of forest structure and succession-potentially through initial inputs of disturbance-produced woody biomass, increased host connectivity and competition-influenced host tree susceptibility to fungal colonization-provide important feedbacks to A. gallica foraging, which in turn influences forest development. The recognition that tree density and competition influence A. gallica foraging suggests that, to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of forest growth, development, tree mortality and biogeochemical cycling, it may be necessary to increase life-history studies and basic occurrence surveys for opportunistic tree pathogens and insect pests.

AB  - Continuous-cover forestry (CCF) is increasingly argued as an alternative to clear-cut harvesting in managed boreal forests to improve water quality and quantity, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration. We review the empirical evidence for the potential benefits of CCF on drained forested peatlands in boreal ecosystems as an alternative to conventional clear-cut harvesting. We also discuss possible risks and uncertainties that need further consideration and highlight unanswered questions that need to be resolved before large-scale implementation. In general, we found that the ability to maintain forest production on drained forested peatlands pri-marily depends on water regulation of the groundwater (GW) table. Currently, the problem with high GW is typically solved using ditch cleaning, but if CCF is adopted, it could be an alternative approach to manage GW without the need of disturbing this already extensive artificial channel network. Implementation of CCF could lower the risk of extreme flooding and droughts, in addition to maintaining water quality and potentially enhancing the carbon sequestration conditions. Furthermore, it could provide a compromise between industrialized forestry and peatland restoration to better meet these targets. However, several important uncertainties remain regarding the potential for natural regeneration in northern latitudes, the net effect of different types of soil damage due to repeated use of heavy machinery, and consequences of climate change that could result in enhanced storm felling. We primarily focus on Swedish conditions, but also evaluate implications in an international context and propose ways to close remaining knowledge gaps.

AB  - Burkina Faso's W National Park (WNPB) is one of the country's biodiversity hotspots. Despite this Park's protection, illegal human activities threaten its vegetation, and little information about the on-site causes of degradation is available. Here we explored the extent and drivers of changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in the WNPB. For this purpose, we used Landsat (1988, 2001 and 2016), and ancillary data to determine the spatial structure and changes in LULC with a random forest classifier. We identified socio-economic factors influencing LULC by conducting household surveys, focus groups, and field observations. We used the ranking and binary logistic regression methods to analyze the socio-economic data. A logistic regression model assessed the relationship between land cover change and socio-economic factors. The results showed that multi-temporal classification performed significantly better than mono-temporal one in the study area. However, the combination of mono-temporal reflectances and vegetation indices for LULC classification significantly enhanced the accuracy to the level of multi-temporal classification. This result in-dicates that this combination is an efficient alternative to multi-temporal classification in the study area where cloud-free imagery is rare. In the WNPB, LULC dynamics from 1988 to 2001 was mainly characterized by reduction of tree savannas (9.4%) and woodland (8.8%) and expansion of bare soil (0.1%) and mixed vegetation (18.1%). From 2001 to 2016, croplands increased by 102.1%. Bush fire (77.19%), wood harvesting (48.25%), lack of rain (48.25%) and elephants' impact (20.18%) were the leading direct causes of LULC change. In general, the perceptions of local populations about vegetation trends were in line with the observations from remote sensing. Altogether, the tree vegetation in the study area decreased significantly between 2001 and 2016, and the cause of this change appears to be unsustainable land-use rather than rainfall conditions. According to these findings, land-use management practices in this park should be more sus-tainable and provide education (and changing habits) to the surrounding population. It is therefore suggested that the government regulate illegal activities through forest law enforcement to protect the WNPB from over-exploitation.

AB  - Climate changes evidenced by an increase in our planet's mean temperature, changes in rainfall, increased sea level and extreme weather conditions, favor air and soil contamination, ocean acidification, droughts, floods, heat waves and forest fires, which affect the health and wellbeing of exposed populations. These changes will exert negative effects on respiratory and cardiovascular systems, nutritional status, burden of infectious diseases, especially vector-borne infections, and human mental health. Moreover, environmental damages, such as loss of biodiversity, ecological collapse and deterioration of socioeconomic factors such as agricultural and fishery production, and the loss of habitable land, will impulse massive migrations. This article summarizes the impact that climate change is expected to have on respiratory, cardiovascular and infectious diseases and its repercussions on people of extreme ages. It is imperative to achieve the immediate commitment of worldwide national governments to control greenhouse gas emissions. The appropriate technology does exist, but political will is urgently needed to accomplish this goal.

AB  - Roller dung beetles play a pivotal role in the nutrient distribution in soil and secondary dispersal of seeds. Dung beetles are sampled either using a dung-baited pitfall trap or an exposed dung pile on the ground. While the former method is useful for a rapid survey of dung beetles, information on the ecology and behaviour of dung beetles can be lost, which the latter method provides, but underestimates species diversity due to its inefficiency in trapping rollers. Efficiency of a new method for sampling rollers-installing guarding pitfall traps around dung piles-is assessed in three habitats-contiguous tropical rainforests, fragmented forests, and disturbed used home gardens-and two diel periods-day and night. Five guarding pitfall traps were installed at 50 cm radius around dung piles. About 98% of the total rollers were sampled in pitfall traps. The habitats were similar when the roller catches of only dung piles-conventional approach-were analyzed, but were different when the rollers of guarding pitfall traps were considered. The roller abundance was negatively affected by forest fragmentation and land-use change. About 98% of the rollers were collected at daytime. Using guarding pitfall traps around dung piles is highly recommended for dung beetle diversity studies.

AB  - Aim Plant herbivory and disease, which are often associated with each other but subject to different processes, are pivotal in biodiversity maintenance and ecosystem function. Although drivers of plant herbivory and disease have been widely studied separately, their relationships, patterns and determinants remain unclear in fragmented landscapes. Methods We surveyed incidence and severity of foliar herbivory and disease of 2,027 adult trees within 30 sites in 17 tropical forest fragments in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. We aim to explore the relationship of plant herbivory and disease, and effects of local environmental variables (forest type, plant richness, elevation, slope, soil properties) and landscape environmental variables (patch size, edge distance, isolation). Results We found that incidence, but not severity of disease was positively correlated with that of herbivory. Herbivory severity and incidence were more associated with local variables; both increased with plant richness but decreased with soil nutrients and pH. In contrast, the landscape variable isolation was the dominant driver of disease, with lower severity and incidence in contiguous forests than forest fragments. Conclusion In summary, we show that herbivory and disease are associated with drivers at different scales in fragmented landscapes. Herbivory is mainly driven by local-scale variables, while disease is mainly driven by landscape-scale variables. To control plant herbivory and disease in fragmented landscapes, increasing landscape connectivity and conserving different forest types are urgently required to maintain ecosystem functions under global land use change.

AB  - Deep soil water utilization allows plants to cope with drought stress. However, little is known about the roles of the understorey layers in driving spatio-temporal variations of deep soil water in forests and how the patterns of deep soil water use among life-forms contribute to community assembly processes. We assessed the spatio-temporal patterns and determinants of deep water utilization of tree, shrub and herb layers in subtropical coniferous plantations and investigated associations between deep water use parameters and dominance and richness of understorey vegetation. We found that the understorey layer had a higher reliance on deep soil water in the dry season, a larger seasonal plasticity of deep soil water uptake, but lower spatial variability in deep soil water utilization than the tree layer. We showed that greater reliance of the tree layer on deep soil water was associated with decreased shrub layer diversity, whereas greater reliance of the shrub layer on deep water was associated with increased herb layer diversity. Synthesis. Our results highlight the roles of understorey layers in driving the temporal dynamics of deep soil water in forests and improve our understanding of how deep soil water use patterns among life-forms shape community assembly in forests.

AB  - Over the past century, vast swathes of Chile's biologically diverse temperate rainforest have been replaced with radiata pine monoculture as a direct result of exchanges with California that began during the mid-1800s, when Chile experienced a boom in wheat exports to meet the demand of California gold rush populations. Chile's "green rush" of radiata pine has hastened the displacement of people and plants and has created a flammable landscape that acts synergistically with climate change to create larger wildfires and longer fire seasons. The work presented here is premised on the understanding that land is a living, storied site that reveals lessons for correcting our behavior. I draw on theoretical contributions from Native American and Indigenous studies to understand the lessons from fire and the importance of traditional ecological knowledges from Mapuche and California Native homelands in response to climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary Wormlions are small fly larvae that dig pit-traps in loose soil to hunt ants and other prey. Their natural habitat is caves, but they are also abundant in Mediterranean cities below man-made shelters, even in thin layers of soil. They are especially common next to building walls. First, we show that wormlions are indeed closer to walls than expected by chance. Next, we tested several explanations for this observation: the possible effect of soil depth, soil particle size, shade, and prey abundance. We could not find a single explanation for the wormlion's proximity to walls, and in each site, a different set of explanations held true. The final step was to conduct an experiment. We placed wormlions on clear sand either in the center or next to the wall and observed whether they moved after a day. Those placed in the center moved over longer distances, and we interpret this result to indicate that those adjacent to the wall are more satisfied with their location. Our study provides an example for how animals take advantage of human-made changes in the habitat and prosper in urban habitats. Whereas most animals find urban habitats to be inferior to natural habitats, some "urban specialist" species thrive there. Wormlions present such an example. Common in Mediterranean cities, they cluster in thin layers of loose soil below man-made shelters. Wormlions are fly larvae that dig pit-traps in loose soil and hunt small arthropods. Our first aim was to determine whether wormlion pits accumulate next to walls. Wormlion pits were indeed closer to walls than expected by chance at most of the study sites. We examined possible factors behind this apparent preference, combining field observations and experiments, laboratory work, and theoretical analysis. We examined the effect of soil depth, particle size, shade, and prey abundance. Each factor provided a partial explanation for the wormlions' proximity to walls, but none provided an overall explanation. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model, demonstrating under which conditions wall-adjacent positions are favored. Finally, we created artificial microhabitats, and placed wormlions either in the center or next to the wall. The wormlions in the center moved over longer distances than those next to the wall and did so more in the wall's direction. The abundance of walls may help to explain the success of wormlions in urban habitats.

AB  - Soil erosion valuation at a spatial scale is crucial for assessing natural resource quality in a farming country like Ethiopia. The study's goal was to determine the rate of soil erosion in the Megech-Dirma catchment in Northwest Ethiopia using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model aggregation with Geographic Information System and Remote Sensing. Sediment yield and transport were also estimated using sediment delivery ratio. Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model data inputs included precipitation data for the R value, soil data for the K value, land cover data from satellite images for the C and P value, and topographical data from a Digital Elevation Model for the LS component. It was completed using the ArcGIS 10.4 software. The mean annual soil loss is 110.60 t ha(-1) yr(-1). Each year, a total of 8499.74 t ha(-1) yr(-1) of soil eroded and on average resulting in 1605.30 t/km(2)/yr, sediment material has been transported to the stream channels and deposited with a sediment delivery ratio of 1.87. The strength of soil erosion in the area is divided into six categories. The erosion rate classes were 46.38 percent (0-12 t ha(-1) yr(-1)) low, 13.63 percent (12-20 ha(-1) yr(-1)) moderate, 9.22 percent (20-35 ha(-1) yr(-1)) high, 12.30 percent (35-50 ha(-1) yr(-1)) very high, 7.20 percent (50 up to 100 ha(-1) yr(-1)) severe, and 11.27 percent (>100 ha(-1) yr(-1)) very severe erosion. According to erosion severity, 46.38 percent of the watershed is at risk of low erosion, while 11.27 percent is at risk of extremely severe erosion. The north and northeastern sections of the watershed have a moderate to extremely severe erosion risk due to steep slopes, high rainfall, and weak conservation measures. The severely eroded parts of the plateau and steep portions are proposed to be covered by plantation, stone bund, and check dam constructions.

AB  - Purpose For sustaining productivity and increasing biodiversity in Cox ' s Bazar, a coastal area, and Bandarban, a hilly area, in Bangladesh, it is important to study the soil properties of the homegardens in these districts. We assessed the effects of varying forest management on soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and nutrients (P, K, Na, and Ca) between the hill and coastal homegardens. Methods Soil samples were collected from 24 homegardens; 12 from the hill and 12 from the coastal sites. Results In both homegardens, the topsoil C and N stocks were up to 23% and 41%, respectively, higher than those in the deepest soil. We found a vertical decrease in C:N ratio in the soil of both homegardens, and the highest C:N ratios and C stock (49.90 Mg ha(-1)) were in the hill homegardens. The topsoil C in the hill homegardens was higher most probably due to higher deposition of litterfall and/or lower litter harvesting or mulching. The highest total N stock (5.97 Mg ha(-1)) was in the coastal homegardens, which may be due to higher tree density and species composition. The concentration and stocks of nutrients decreased vertically in the soil and this decrease was higher in the hill than in the coastal homegardens (except for P). Conclusions It could be concluded that overall nutrient dynamics may be significantly affected by litter deposition, stand structure, and the variation in the rainfall. Soil N and nutrient deficiency should be considered in the planning of sustainable forest management to sustain productivity and increase biodiversity.

AB  - Sustainable development is one of the ubiquitous paradigms of this century. Poverty, biodiversity loss and climate change are some of the obstacles to achieving sustainable development. To mitigate these encumbrances, countries have painstakingly adopted various policies and interventions. Public work programs, one of the initiatives targeting the construction of strong social safety nets through redistribution of wealth and generation of meaningful employment are increasingly being launched in developing countries. This paper is an attempt to examine the effects of phased implementation of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) on the rejuvenation and restoration of community forests in India. Searches performed in multidisciplinary electronic databases (Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed, Emerald Insight, Google Scholar, Taylor and Francis Online, Wiley Online Library, and Springer Link) indicated that MGREGS is one of the largest labor guarantee schemes ever recorded in India and globally, and has holistically contributed to reforestation and afforestation through its land development themes to reduce vulnerability of rural communities to recurrent droughts, floods and improve soil moisture and fertility. It is evident that MGNREGS in synergy with the government forest development programs have the potential to promote social afforestation, reforestation and biodiversity conservation as witnessed in the Sundarbans. These have the potential to empower local people through creation of income generating activities and provision of local forest goods and services. However, the creation of forests as rural assets necessitates that emphasis should be laid on their maintenance so as to ensure that they are given their due importance for sustainable and long-term benefit of the poor rural households. This study highlights the need to perform a comprehensive assessment of forest assets that has been established through MNREGS across states in India.

AB  - In the Czech Republic, the afforestation of agricultural land has been supported by providing subsidies from the government and the European Union. Afforestation of less-productive agricultural land provides many benefits including carbon sequestration, soil erosion control, biodiversity, water retention, cooling, social benefits, decreasing noise and light pollution, increasing air quality, wind speed reduction, oxygen production, wood production and non-wood products. In some aspects, it is possible to produce wood of the same quality on former agricultural land compared to permanent forest land. In this study, we attempted to find out the course of temperatures and volumetric water content as well as some other physical soil properties (at depths of 20, 40 and 60 cm) 9 years after the afforestation of agricultural land (warm, mild dry region of the Czech Republic) with a mixture of broadleaved tree species (Quercus robur L., Quercus rubra L. and Acer platanoides L.) or monospecific Pinus sylvestris L. stand; the study was performed in the period from April to the beginning of November 2020. Concerning the studied physical soil properties, the value of bulk density was higher (and total porosity lower) at a depth of 20 cm in Pinus sylvestris L. compared with agricultural land or the mixture of broadleaves; the water stability of soil aggregates was higher after the afforestation with the mixture of broadleaves. The temperature was lower in the soil of afforested plots (at all studied depths) compared to the agriculturally used land. Differences in rainfall interception, transpiration, soil (and forest floor) properties and other factors could influence the obtained values of water content in the soil of the studied plots. The average volumetric water contents were the highest in the plots with Scots pine (depth of 20 cm) and broadleaves (depth of 40 cm), and on the control plot (depth of 60 cm). The volumetric water content at a soil depth of 20 cm was not significantly (P 0.05) different when the plot with Scots pine and agriculturally used land were compared. In all other cases and depths, the differences between plots were significant (P < 0.05).

AB  - Excess inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) from the atmosphere will cause disturbances to forest ecosystems, including soil and stream water acidification, plant nutrient imbalances, alterations of species compositions (such as biodiversity losses), and nitrogen (N) leaching into stream water. Central Japan (or Chubu region) has experienced both domestic and transboundary air pollution since the 1950s. Emissions of nitrogen oxides in China peaked in 2011/2012, although the peak of ammonia emissions has not been confirmed. Changes in these emissions have been reflected gradually in atmospheric N deposition rates and the biogeochemical cycle in ecosystems in central Japan. We synthetically analyzed the current N saturation situation for forest ecosystems in central Japan based on our recent publications and the latest available dataset. The stream water in the Lake Ijira catchment (IJR) on the Pacific side in Gifu Prefecture became acidified and N-saturated in the mid-1990s but has begun to recover with a decrease in nitrate (NO3-) concentration since the mid-2000s. The progress and recovery of N saturation appeared to be related to the trends of atmospheric deposition, climatic anomalies (such as the cool and drought summers in 1993/1994), and forest management. The NO3 (-) concentrations in stream water within the forest catchment of Kajikawa (KJK) on the Sea of Japan side in Niigata Prefecture have continued to increase, although the catchment seems to be recovering from acidification owing to a decline in atmospheric sulfur (and probably N) deposition. Finally, the NO3- concentration in stream water in KJK became higher than that in IJR, a direct inversion of the situation in the early 2000s. The recent analysis of O-17 excess in NO3- estimated that the export of biologically unprocessed atmospheric NO3- via stream water was larger in KJK than in IJR. The N cycle in soil-plant systems likely does not function as expected under excess atmospheric N input (still over 10 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), especially in KJK. In addition to atmospheric N deposition, reduced N uptake rates as coniferous forests mature, and changing precipitation amounts/patterns appear to accelerate N leaching from forest catchments in central Japan.

AB  - Purpose of the study: to substantiate the prospects of using various species, varieties and forms of the genus Robinia in protective afforestation and landscaping of settlements in dry-steppe and semi-desert zones of southern Russia. It is established that the main limiting factors affecting the growth, development and condition of representatives of the genus Robinia in the Volgograd region are winter temperatures up to -37 degrees C, as well as poor moisture availability and uneven distribution of precipitation during the growing season in combination with extremely low temperatures in the autumn-winter period. All representatives of the generic complex belong to the group of plants that start late and finish the vegetative period late. Phenological atypicity is in the lower half of the normal range, with indicators from +1 degrees C to 0, which indicates a high level of adaptation to the climatic conditions of the region. In the process of long-term acclimatization, many introduced species have developed a number of genotypic adaptations and are currently able to tolerate extreme winter temperatures up to -37 degrees C. An assessment of potential drought resistance based on the water-retaining ability of the leaves showed that higher rates of water-resistance capacity (76.8% water loss) are typical of R. neomexicana, which has a natural distribution area in the western arid part of the North American continent. R. viscosa var. hartwegii, with a natural distribution in the areas of the monsoon subtropical climate of eastern North America, is distinguished by low indicators (94.1% water loss), as are clonal decorative forms of R. pseudoacacia: f. pyramidalis and f. umbraculifera (97.6-95.8% water loss), which are common only in culture and characterized by a whole complex of low indicators of bioecological stability. The data obtained by us allow us to recommend the following assortment of species and forms of Robinia for protective afforestation and landscaping in the arid territories of southern Russia: R. pseudoacacia, R. neomexicana var. neomexicana, R. neomexicana var. rusbyi and R. pseudoacacia x R. neomexicana.

AB  - Introduction: Dung beetles perform important functions in terrestrial ecosystems, but anthropic pressures affect them negatively. These effects are well documented in neotropical lowland forests but have been studied little in Andean forests. Objective: To evaluate how the attributes of the dung beetle assemblages and three of their ecological functions differ in three types of vegetation cover, and to determine the relationships between attributes and functions, and among functions. Methods: Dung beetles were captured with pitfall traps, and ecological functions were measured through a field experiment in the farm "El Ocaso" (Colombia), in three types of vegetation cover: secondary forest, mixed forest and cattle pasture (three independent sites per cover). The assemblage attributes that were evaluated were abundance, number of species, biomass, and weighted mean body length; functions measured were dung removal, soil excavation, and secondary seed dispersal. Results: It was found that both the assemblage attributes and the ecological functions were negatively affected in the more disturbed vegetation covers, particularly in cattle pastures. Most of the assemblage attributes correlated positively with functions; soil excavation and secondary seed dispersal had a strong positive correlation with dung removal. Conclusions: Dung beetle assemblages play important ecological functions and they are sensitive to ecosystem disturbances. This study shows how dung beetles and their functions are affected negatively when forest is trans-formed to cattle pasture in the understudied and highly fragmented Andean forest ecosystems.

AB  - The diverse lowland forests of Southeast Asia and Borneo are globally recognised biodiversity hotspots containing rare and endangered species and high levels of plant endemism. Heath and peat swamp forests are Bornean lowland forest types with distinctive plant communities that primarily correspond to a soil water gradient from dryland heath to waterlogged peat swamps. Although tree diversity of Bornean heath and peat swamp forests is well described, little is known of their woody seedling communities. This study investigated diversity, abundance and community composition of woody seedlings in mixed peat-swamp (MSF), heath Within twenty-two 3 x 3 m plots in these forest types, seedlings of 50 < cm height < 100 were censused and taxonomically identified, and measurements of selected environmental and soil properties were obtained. In total, 84 species of woody seedlings from 71 genera were recorded, with Myrtaceae most abundant in MSF, KF and SAP, while Dipterocarpaceae and Sapotaceae were most abundant in HF. Mean seedling abundance and diversity indices did not differ between forest types, but mean species richness was significantly higher in MSF than SAP. Woody seedling community composition differed between forest types and was influenced by soil properties, with MSF seedling communities influenced by total K concentration and soil pH, while SAP was influenced by soil gravimetric water content and total P concentration. These findings highlight the need for increased research on seedling ecology in tropical heath and peat swamp forest formations to further elucidate mechanisms underlying species diversity in these forests, and to guide programmes for their conservation, sustainable management and reforestation.

AB  - Monitoring and Assessment (M&A) of environmental resources aims to support the formulation of policies and follow up on outcomes of their implementation. In this study, the state of M&A is explored for Ethiopia with a focus on forests and water resources. The study is intended to serve as recommendations for future M&A applications in Ethiopia, as well as fulfillment of SDGs and other national and international commitments. Expert meetings, key informant interviews, and selected document analysis served as sources of information. The findings were summarized using qualitative grading and institutional mapping. Basic results of the study are that monitoring data on climate and streamflow are standardized in forms that can be communicated to policymakers. Scantier and less standardized are environmental data on soils, sediment transport, forests, biodiversity, and air quality. Water quality, soil moisture, groundwater level, forest biomass, and soil carbon are rarely monitored and can only be found in reports or studies for the fulfillment of academic degree requirements. Resources like nutrient fluxes have rarely been documented, not at all in some cases. There is considerable scope for tapping both technological advances and experiences of citizen science and local participation in environmental governance to rapidly expand and improve monitoring from local to regional and national scales. The study showed that there is a need for establishing a coordinated national system for monitoring and assessing the status of the environment, including the use of natural resources. Communicating such data to the scientific and wider public will support evidence-based planning and policy-making towards national development.

AB  - The Amazon Basin currently hosts the world's largest pool of terrestrial biodiversity and prior to European colonization of the Americas there were large human communities living in parkland ecosystems. We examine the formation of archaeological sites in the northeast sector of the Caxiuana National Forest (CNF) using light stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon, total carbon and nitrogen and Optically Stimulated Luminescence to characterize long-term human landscape management practices. Previous research in the CNF has documented differences in pH, calcium, total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (TN) between terra preta and terra marrom contexts as well as different forest structures based on remote sensing analysis. Therefore, we adopt a comparative approach, examining the formation processes of on-site (terra preta), near-site (terra marrom) and offsite (latosol) contexts. TOC and TN values obtained in our study augment and support previous research demonstrating significantly higher on-site values relative to near-site and off-site. However, the stable isotopes (d(13)C, d(15)N) assayed from terra preta, terra marrom and latosols show statistically overlapping values, indicating the persistence of closed canopy in off-site and near-site contexts and the use of this canopy in the formation of on-site soils (terra preta). Our results corroborate the hypothesis that closed canopy ecosystems and human settlements persisted in the Amazon for thousands of years and formed the foundation of the region's rich biodiversity.

AB  - Plant functional traits can affect ecosystem functions and services. Although many studies have investigated the driving factors of plant functional-trait distribution, few have explored the relationship between terrain factors and such distribution. Here, we proposed three hypotheses to explain the above-mentioned relationship: 1) terrain factors affect the distribution pattern of plant functional traits; 2) the relationship between terrain factors and plant functional-trait distribution is biome-dependent; 3) the relationship between terrain factors and plant functional-trait distribution is scale-dependent. To test these hypotheses, we used geographically weighted regression and ordinary least squares to study the relationship between functional traits (specific leaf area, height, and wood density) and terrain factors (roughness, terrain ruggedness index, terrain position index, and vector ruggedness measure) in 14 different biomes at scales of 5 and 50 km2. We found that terrain factors affected the distribution of plant functional traits. Specifically, there was a significant negative correlation between terrain factors and wood density; further, terrain factors had effects on specific leaf areas but not on plant height; furthermore, roughness was the most significant among the influential terrain factors, followed by the vector ruggedness measure and the terrain ruggedness index. Additionally, the effect of biome type on the relationship between terrain factors and plant functional-trait distribution was widespread. Finally, spatial scale effects on biodiversity may depend on the transition between different biomes. Therefore, considering biome and scale effects is essential to understanding heterogeneity and biodiversity, especially in macroecological studies with important scientific and practical significance.

AB  - Soil fungal diversity was studied by next-generation sequencing and compared in two different Malagasy ecosystems, the first a New Protected Area (Maromizaha NAP) that is a rich humid evergreen forest and the second a degraded and declined deciduous forest (Andaravina) whose area has been also eroded. Both areas, however, have comparable annual rainfalls and soil pH values. So it was of interest to examine the soil fungal diversity in each system and compare them. We detected 1,817,658 reads representing Ascomycota, which were dominant in both habitats (55.9%), followed by unidentified fungi (21.5%), Basidiomycota (12.7%) and Mortierellomycota (6.7%), with Mucoromycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and other phyla accounting for less than 5% in total. In detail, 1,142 OTUs out of 1,368 constitute the common core shared by both sampling areas, which are characterized by tropical climate, whereas 185 are Maromizaha specific and 41 Andaravina specific. The most represented guilds involve fungi related to saprotrophic behaviour, with a greater tendency towards pathotrophic mode. A significant variability in terms of richness and abundance is present within Maromizaha, which is a heterogeneous environment for fungi but also for plant composition, as it emerged from the vegetational survey of the investigated sites. A few fungal sequences match taxa from Madagascar, highlighting the scarce representativeness of fungi from this island in the fungal databases and their still low knowledge. Enlarging studies in Madagascar will help not only to unravel its largely unknown fungal biodiversity but also to give a contribution for studies on the reconstruction of the diversity of soil fungi worldwide.

AB  - Agriculture is one of the most critical anthropogenic disturbances to freshwater ecosystems globally. In monsoon Asia, rice paddies provide habitats for aquatic species, but how their associated irrigation systems can affect downstream ecosystems is poorly understood. Here, we used structural equation modeling (SEM) to estimate seasonal variations in benthic macroinvertebrate diversity and environments and quantified indirect effects of land use, especially of rice paddy areas, on benthic macroinvertebrate diversity through local environmental alteration. Our study site was the Yasu River tributary of Lake Biwa, Japan, and we performed our investigation during both irrigation and nonirrigation periods, representing different seasons. Seasonal variations in physical and chemical variables and diversity were observed. Seasonal particulate phosphorus concentrations to a large extent determined the abundance and community composition of benthic macroinvertebrates. SEM revealed that the proportions of forest, urban, and rice paddy areas in the catchment had significant indirect effects on biodiversity indices of local benthic macroinvertebrate communities. The proportion of forest area had robust negative effects on water temperature, but the overall indirect effects on the macroinvertebrate diversity contrasted between the two seasonal periods. The proportion of rice paddy area had a strongly negative indirect effect on the diversity through increased particulate phosphorous loading during the irrigation period, while the proportion of urban area had a significantly negative indirect effect during the nonirrigation period only. The seasonal negative impacts of rice paddy irrigation on benthic macroinvertebrate communities were possibly due to siltation arising from rice paddy soils. Our results have implications for environmental restoration and biodiversity conservation in catchment management.

AB  - The largest North American Silphidae, the American burying beetle (ABB), Nicrophorus americanus Olivier, has been extirpated from similar to 90% of its historic range and is federally threatened. Two distinct populations in the Southern (Oklahoma and Arkansas) and North-Central United States (Nebraska and South Dakota) persist at the western edge of the ABB's former range. In Nebraska, the western limits of occurrence are associated with Merritt Reservoir and linked irrigation canals. ABBs are also found at the nearby hand-planted McKelvie National Forest. While habitat alteration and fragmentation are likely the primary reasons for ABB decline, few studies have examined their response to human habitat modifications unrelated to urbanization or agricultural conversion. Through five-day sampling periods with carrion-baited pitfall traps, ABB were captured and recorded in June and August from 2015 to 2017 at Merritt Reservoir and McKelvie National Forest in Cherry County, Nebraska. Traps were placed in transects (N = 4) at each location with reservoir traps set at the shoreline, transition, and upland habitats and forest traps set in the prairie, transition zone, and pine forest. At Merritt Reservoir, 651 ABB were captured, with significantly more collected at the shoreline. Concurrently, 23 ABB were captured at McKelvie Forest, with more ABB found within the forest compared to nearby prairie. These findings support previous suggestions that the western distribution of ABB is limited by moisture. Further investigation may indicate that reliable soil moisture associated with altered habitats in Nebraska could support ABB and potentially allow western range expansion.

AB  - During the last decades, the demographic trajectory and the associated urban development have increased the demand for urban and peri-urban green space. Peri-urban forests provide a wide range of goods and services to city dwellers critical to human well-being. However, these ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses. This study aimed to assess the effects of forest disturbances on soil erosion dynamics in a periurban forest of Northern Greece, between 1995 and 2020. Monitoring of soil erosion dynamic was performed by coupling the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-computing platform and the RUSLE erosion prediction model. The results highlighted the potential of Landsat imagery to efficiently delineate through time forest cover changes due to the influence of biotic and abiotic factors. After a major fire event, average soil erosion showed an increase of 7.7 t/ha/year whilst the emergency hillslope rehabilitation treatments led to a decrease equal to 8.9 t/ha/year. On the contrary, post-fire watershed stabilization measures and selective logging for the removal of the infested individual trees had a negligible effect on soil loss. The temporal changes in soil loss rate are not only justified by forest cover changes but also by the variability in rainfall, which is also considered a dynamic factor of RUSLE model. Monitoring of soil loss and erosion regulation services over peri-urban forests provide essential information for policy-making and management of these valuable natural resources.

AB  - Plants have evolved a vast array of secondary metabolites that help defend them against natural enemy attack. The production of these secondary metabolites is influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature, rainfall (soil water availability) and atmospheric [CO2], which may be altered under climate change. This study aimed to test how two of these environmental factors, namely soil water availability and [CO2], will affect secondary metabolite and biomass production in Eucalypts. To investigate this, we measured secondary metabolite and biomass production of three Eucalypt species (Eucalyptus grandis, E. moluccana, E. saligna) grown under ambient and elevated [CO2] (400 and 600 ppm, respectively) and water-stressed and well-watered conditions, in a fully factorial glasshouse experiment. The secondary metabolites measured were foliar phenolic concentration as well as terpene and green leaf volatile emissions. We found that water stress did not alter secondary metabolite production. Unsurprisingly, the water-stressed plants maximised their water uptake potential by reducing shoot biomass but maintaining root biomass. The detrimental effects of water stress on shoot biomass production were not reduced under elevated [CO2] compared to ambient [CO2], despite all species experiencing significant reductions in stomatal conductance. Further, [CO2] as a single factor did not have a significant effect on species' net carbon gain, with an increase in green leaf volatile emissions under elevated [CO2] being mitigated by a reduction in shoot biomass production. These results suggest that reductions in carbon gains due to water stress will affect the growth of Eucalypts rather than their chemical defence capabilities.

AB  - 1,2,3-tricholoropropane (TCP) is an impurity common in nematicides applied to agricultural soils from the 1940s to the 1980s. Evidence from animal studies indicates that TCP is a probable human carcinogen. TCP leaches through the soil into groundwater where it persists and contaminates thousands of wells in Asia, Europe, and North America. In California, TCP contaminates drinking water wells, with the highest levels of TCP beneath agricultural land used to grow grapevines. This study performs a mass balance and evaluates the ability of three types of tree-based machine learning models to predict TCP concentration in California's Central Valley aquifer system: classifica- tion and regression trees (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). To construct the models, multiple spatial explanatory variables were used, including historical agricultural land use data, irrigation levels, precipitation, soil type, groundwater age, redox state, and the presence of the co-contaminant nitrate. To estimate the amount of TCP applied to farmland in California, state historical pesticide and land use documents were used in the mass balance. Between 110,000 and 4,300,000 kg of TCP are estimated to have accumulated in the subsurface. Machine learning models indicate that the most important explanatory variables to predict TCP contamination of groundwater are precipitation, redox state, and the presence of the co-contaminant nitrate. Additionally, a 1000-m buffer area offers a slightly higher predictive performance as compared to 500-m and 1500- m buffers. Furthermore, the RF model outperforms CART and BRT for predictive performance. Finally, modeling using decision trees can predict TCP contamination levels in areas where monitoring is lacking, help target future TCP monitoring efforts, and aid in identifying areas to avoid when drilling new drinking water wells.

AB  - Accelerating urbanization and industrialization have had substantial impacts on economic and social activities, changed the surface environment of the earth, and affected global climate change and biodiversity. If reasonable and effective management measures are not implemented in time, unchecked urbanization and industrialization will damage the structure and function of the ecosystem, endanger human and biological habitats, and ultimately lead to difficulties in achieving sustainable development. This study investigates the habitat quality effect of land use transition and analyzes the cause and mechanism of such changes from an economic-social-ecological complex system perspective in the Henan Water Source (HWS) area of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (MRP). The study comprehensively examines the characteristics of land use transition from 2000 to 2020. The results indicate that the habitat quality of the HWS area of the MRP decreased slowly over the past 20 years, with a more obvious decrease in the past 10 years. Specifically, the proportion of high quality habitat areas is relatively large and stable, and the medium and low quality habitat areas increase significantly. Analyzing the change degree of the proportion of different levels of habitat quality area in each county, revealed that Dengzhou City had the most dramatic change, followed by the Xichuan and Neixiang counties; other counties did not undergo obvious change. The results of habitat quality factor detection by GeoDetector showed that land use transition plays a decisive role in the change of habitat quality. The types of land use with high habitat suitability compared to those with low habitat suitability will inevitably lead to a decrease in habitat quality. Additionally, elevation, slope, landform type, and annual precipitation are important factors affecting the habitat quality in the HWS area of the MRP, indicating that ecological factors determine the background conditions of habitat quality. The gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, the proportion of agricultural output value, grain yield per unit area in economic factors, population density, and urbanization rate in social factors affect the spatial differentiation of habitat quality to a certain extent. Soil type, annual mean temperature, vegetation type, and NDVI index have weak effects on habitat quality, while road network density and slope aspect have no significant effect on habitat quality. The results of this study provide a basis for the improvement of habitat quality, ecosystem protection and restoration, land resource management, and related policies in the HWS area of the MRP. They also provide references for the research and practice of the habitat quality effects of land use transition in other regions.

AB  - Given the developmental program outlined in United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 15 (Life on Land) and the to effectively address the challenge of biodiversity decline while mitigating the adverse effects of climate change, particularly drought, on terrestrial forest ecosystems, a fundamental reorientation of global forest restoration paradigms is warranted. It is imperative to move beyond a narrow emphasis on expanding forest area and instead prioritize the enhancement of biodiversity and functional attributes within these ecosystems. However, the differential response mechanisms of forest ecosystem functional communities and main plant functional types (PFTs) to environmental factors, especially soil and topography, remains unclear, especially at plant level. Here, we divided the functional communities of 93 sites in the study area into seven groups through Two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN), and studied the different functional communities, namely dynamic succession, species richness, and PFT compositional differences. We also analyzed the various PFTs and functional community response mechanisms to soil and topographic factors using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The main results were as follows: (1) With the successional stages of PFTs, vegetation diversity across multiple functional communities inceased, tree and shrub proportions and importance increased, while herbs decreased. (2) From the arid and barren areas (i.e., G2), to the humid and fertile areas (i.e., G6 and G7), various compositional PFT differences, and their responses to soil and topographic factors, were found, namely, xerophytic, annual and biennial species gradually changed to mesophytic, hygrophytic, and perennial species (richness increased 6.94 similar to 27.33%, important value (IV) increased 8.73 similar to 29.45%) for shrubs and herbs. (3) Functional communities in various successional stages display distinct sensitivities to soil and topographic factors, as evidenced by a notable increase in the richness and IV of deciduous broad-leaved tree species, rendering their communities more responsive to SOC and AS, whereas evergreen coniferous trees (e.g., Pinus tabuliformis Carr.) were sensitive to altitude (AL) and exhibited a tendency to transition from plantations to natural secondary forests predominantly at higher altitudes (above 1200 m). Our findings suggest that site conditions influence scenarios, and that different PFT responses and adjustments to soil and topography factors affect whole functional community dynamic succession processes, which can profoundly impact forest ecosystem function predictions based on PFT changes in the Loess Plateau of China.

AB  - To reveal the changes in the interactions between invertebrates and microbes in decomposing litter with seasonal rainfall, litterbags containing camphor (Cinnamomum longepaniculatum) and Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) litter were therefore in situ incubated on the floor of Masson pine-camphor mixed plantations in the subtropical region of China. Different mesh sizes of litterbags were used to control the access of the invertebrates. The in-vertebrates in litterbags were collected by funnel method, and microbial communities were detected by phos-pholipid fatty acid (PLFA) method in slightly rainy season (SRS; November 1-December 24), micro rainy season (MRS; December 25-March 7), early rainy season (ERS; March 8-June 15) and rainy season (RS; June 16-October 31) during two decomposition years. The abundance and composition of microbial and invertebrate communities varied significantly with seasonal rainfall and tree species. Invertebrate exclusion generally decreased the bacterial and fungal biomass, and the biomass of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria in Masson pine needle litter, but generally increased these indices in camphor foliar litter. Inverte-brate exclusion decreased the mass loss rate of Masson pine litter, but increased the mass loss rate of camphor litter. Total microbial biomass and bacterial biomass in both foliar litters were generally higher in SRS and MRS than these in ERS and RS during the first decomposition year, whereas the situation reversed during the second decomposition year. The abundance of invertebrates increased gradually from the first SRS to the second SRS and decreased gradually afterwards. Briefly, the interactions between invertebrate and microbial communities varied greatly with litter types and seasons. Positive and negative interactions between invertebrate and microbes were respectively observed in Masson pine and camphor litters, and differential responses of microbial biomass and mass loss rate to invertebrate exclusion were found in two litter types. In turn, the interactions between in-vertebrates and microbes run the litter decomposition.

AB  - Simple Summary: Regenerating forests represent over half of all tropical forests. While regeneration processes of trees and animal groups have been studied, there is surprisingly little information about how the diversity and community composition of fungi and other microorganisms change and what ecological roles play in tropical forest regeneration. In this study, we compared the diversity and community composition of trees and soil fungi among primary forests and regenerating forests of different ages in two sampling areas in southern Costa Rica. Our study shows that while forest age has a significant influence, environmental factors, such as mesoclimate and soil chemistry, have stronger effects on both fungal and tree communities. Moreover, we observed that the more dissimilar tree communities are between any two sites, the more dissimilar the composition of fungal communities. The results presented here contribute to a better understanding of the successional processes of tropical forests in different regions and inform land use and forest management strategies, including, but not limited to, conservation, restoration, and sustainable use.
   Successional dynamics of plants and animals during tropical forest regeneration have been thoroughly studied, while fungal compositional dynamics during tropical forest succession remain unknown, despite the crucial roles of fungi in ecological processes. We combined tree data and soil fungal DNA metabarcoding data to compare richness and community composition along secondary forest succession in Costa Rica and assessed the potential roles of abiotic factors influencing them. We found a strong coupling of tree and soil fungal community structure in wet tropical primary and regenerating secondary forests. Forest age, edaphic variables, and regional differences in climatic conditions all had significant effects on tree and fungal richness and community composition in all functional groups. Furthermore, we observed larger site-to-site compositional differences and greater influence of edaphic and climatic factors in secondary than in primary forests. The results suggest greater environmental heterogeneity and greater stochasticity in community assembly in the early stages of secondary forest succession and a certain convergence on a set of taxa with a competitive advantage in the more persisting environmental conditions in old-growth forests. Our work provides unprecedented insights into the successional dynamics of fungal communities during secondary tropical forest succession.

AB  - The interactions between figs and their pollinators are among the most specialized examples of mutualism between plants and insects. Based on their life-histories and obligate mutualism, it is reasonable to expect an environmentally-dependent trophic cascade exists between figs and their pollinators. Understanding the mechanisms involved in soil-plant-pollinator trophic cascade relationships will advance our knowledge of how obligate mutualist systems respond to environmental change. We sampled rhizosphere soil, leaves, syconia, and fig wasps (Ceratosolen) of a dioecious prostrate shrub, Ficus tikoua from southwestern China, and measured their carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios. The mean leaves delta C-13 values of F. tikoua were -28.86 +/- 1.24%, which suggests it is a typical C-3 plant. We detected a significant difference for delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of F. tikoua among different populations related to environmental factors such as longitude, altitude, and annual average temperature. The delta C-13 values showed a significantly positive correlation between fig wasps and host. The delta N-15 in fig wasps were 3.4% higher than those in F. tikoua, and were positively correlated with delta N-15 in leaves. These results indicated that fig wasps were feeding on F. tikoua. Moreover, the delta N-15 values among soil, leaves, and syconia showed significantly positive correlations, indicating the trophic linkage among soil-plant-pollinators. In summary, we noted that environmental factors shaped population variations in stable isotopic patterns of F. tikoua, and such variations drove stable isotopic signatures of its specific pollinators by trophic cascade. Future environmental changes could potentially impact the maintenance and stability of this highly specific pollination system of figs and fig wasps.

AB  - Tropical forests are characterized by vast biomass, complex structures and mega-biodiversity. However, the adaptation processes of these forests to seasonal water availability are less understood, especially those located in the monsoonal and mountainous regions of tropical Southeast Asia. This study used four representative tropical forests spanning from 2 degrees N to 22 degrees N in continental Southeast Asia to address dry-condition photosynthesis at the seasonal scale. We first provided novel and reliable estimations of ecosystem photosynthesis (gross primary production; GPP) seasonality at all four sites. As expected, both evergreen and deciduous seasonal forests exhibited higher GPPs during the rainy season than during the dry season. A bimodal pattern corresponding to solar radiation occurred in the GPP of the perhumid forest. The surface conductance (G(s)) was consistently lower both in the dry season and during dry spells (DSPs) than during the wet season and non-dry spells. However, this did not prevent GPP from increasing alongside increasing irradiance in the perhumid forest, suggesting that other ecosystem physiological properties, for example, the light-saturated photosynthetic rate, must have increased, thus surpassing the effect of G(s) reduction. Thus, perhumid forests could be defined as light-demanding ecosystems with regard to their seasonal dynamics. Seasonal forests are water-stressed ecosystems in the dry season, as shown by the reductions in GPP, G(s) and related ecosystem physiological properties. At all four forest sites, we observed a lack of consistent adaptive strategy to fit the water seasonality due to the diversity in leaf phenology, soil nutrient availability, root depth and other potential factors.

AB  - Tamarindus indica L. is a forest plant species widely used in semi-arid regions and has an important socioeconomic role. A 90 d greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of soil amendments with biochar and/or three Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) strains; Rhizophagus fasciculatus (Rf), Rhizophagus aggregatus (Ra), and Rhizophagus irregularis (Ri) on T. indica grown under aluminum stress. The amendments consisted of 5% biochar and 20 g kg(-1) AMF as (i) control; (ii) biochar; (iii) biochar + Rf; (iv) biochar + Ra; (v) biochar + Ri; (vi) Rf; (vii) Ra; (viii) Ri. The treatments with biochar significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil pH and reduced the content of soil exchangeable Al3+ relative to the control and exclusive AMF treatments. All the treatments improved total nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by roots and shoot of T. indica and resulted in improved plant growth and root/shoot dry weight. The ability of biochar to enhance the soil's water-holding capacity played a key role in improving the intensity of mycorrhization. Overall, biochar amendments significantly improved the photosynthetic potential of T. indica and the activities of antioxidant enzymes compared to other treatments. Thus, the combined effects of enhanced (a) soil physicochemical parameters, (b) mycorrhization, (c) nutrient uptake, (d) photosynthetic potential, and (e) antioxidant activities played an important role in mitigating Al-related stress to improve the growth of T. indica. Therefore, the application of biochar in combination with AMFs can serve as a strategy for ensuring plant biodiversity in acid and Al-toxic soils in arid and semiarid regions in Africa.

AB  - Tropical ecosystems have the highest levels of biodiversity, cycle more water and absorb more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Consequently, these ecosystems are extremely important components of Earth's climatic system and biogeochemical cycles. Plant hydraulics is an essential discipline to understand and predict the dynamics of tropical vegetation in scenarios of changing water availability. Using published plant hydraulic data we show that the trade-off between drought avoidance (expressed as deep-rooting, deciduousness and capacitance) and hydraulic safety (P50 - the water potential when plants lose 50% of their maximum hydraulic conductivity) is a major axis of physiological variation across tropical ecosystems. We also propose a novel and independent axis of hydraulic trait variation linking vulnerability to hydraulic failure (expressed as the hydraulic safety margin (HSM)) and growth, where inherent fast-growing plants have lower HSM compared to slow-growing plants. We surmise that soil nutrients are fundamental drivers of tropical community assembly determining the distribution and abundance of the slow-safe/fast-risky strategies. We conclude showing that including either the growth-HSM or the resistance-avoidance trade-off in models can make simulated tropical rainforest communities substantially more vulnerable to drought than similar communities without the trade-off. These results suggest that vegetation models need to represent hydraulic trade-off axes to accurately project the functioning and distribution of tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Tropical dry forests (TDFs) usually occur as mosaics at different stages of natural regeneration, along which variations in soil attributes (fertility and texture) can affect plant growth and leaf traits and, consequently, leaf herbivory. In the present study, we used a chronosequence approach to determine the variations in plant growth, leaf defense, and insect herbivory in different successional species groups, following the predictions of the resource availability hypothesis: plants at early successional stages would grow faster, have lower specific leaf mass (SLM), and suffer higher herbivore damage than late successional plants. For this purpose, we measured plant diameter and collected leaves at the end of the rainy season (April) during three consecutive years in three different successional stages (early, intermediate, and late). In total, we sampled 38 plant species, from which 31 species were exclusive to a single successional stage (10 early, 13 intermediate, and eight late species). Our results did not conform to the resource availability hypothesis, as plants growing in early successional stages had higher growth rates and SLM, and lower leaf damage by herbivores. Soil fertility and texture did not affect plant growth or SLM, but leaf damage was negatively affected by SLM. Apart from being a defensive trait, SLM is also involved in the conservation of water and nutrients and photoprotection, and its variation along successional gradients in TDFs conforms to a continuum from conservative traits in hot and dry, early successional stages, to acquisitive traits in more humid late stages. Although other plant defenses must be considered, our three-year study indicates that the resource availability hypothesis, which was formulated for wet forests, should be adapted to deciduous TDFs where water availability is the main environmental filter along succession.

AB  - Twenty-five years after planting, we measured the survival, growth and reproduction of 153 Quercus ilex plantations promoted by the afforestation programme of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy in agricultural fields in the east of the Iberian Peninsula, as a function of climatic aridity and stand characteristics related to water supply and competition among trees for water. Using field sampling, we found that, on average, 80% of the trees in plantations survived, more than 55% had already produced acorns and the tallest tree in each field exceeded 4 m, which are all higher values than those reported for forest plantations of this species in the same area and which represent the overcoming of the limitations imposed by climatic aridity on the natural regeneration of the species. A small proportion of the variation in all success variables was explained by water-related plantation characteristics, such as planting density, drought intensity in the year after planting, and soil permeability. However, climatic aridity only influenced the proportion of reproductive trees, but not the other variables of plantation success. However, most of the variation in planting success variables was linked to who owned the field, which nursery produced the seedlings, and the year of planting. Our results support the idea that the deep soils of agricultural fields counteract the negative effect of climatic aridity on plant performance, but that it is necessary to standardise nursery and planting practices, adapt planting density to the environmental characteristics of the site and provide irrigation supply in the early years to ensure the success of future plantations.

AB  - Globally, the loss of forest vegetation is a significant concern due to the crucial roles that forests play in the Earth's system, including the provision of ecosystem services, participation in biogeochemical cycles, and support for human well-being. Forests are especially critical in mountains environments, where deforestation can lead to accelerated biodiversity loss, soil erosion, flooding, and reduced agricultural productivity, as well as increased poverty rates. In response to these problems, China has implemented a series of ecological restoration programs aimed at restoring forests. However, there is a lack of knowledge as to whether the forest cover is increasing or decreasing, as well as the relative roles played by natural and human factors in forest change. Here, we aim to address these issues by analyzing the pattern and process of the forest changes in Guizhou province, a typical mountainous karst area with a fragile environment in southwestern China, between 1980 and 2018, and evaluating the extent to which these forest changes were influenced by natural and anthropogenic driving forces. Using a temporal sequence of satellite images and a Markov model, we found that the forest cover increased by 468 km(2), and that over 33% of the cropland in Guizhou province was converted into forest between 1980 and 2018, with the most significant increases in the forest cover occurring in Qiandongnan. Through correlation analyses and generalized linear model (GLM) regression, we demonstrate that management factors exerted a more significant positive impact on the forest cover than climate change. While the mean annual precipitation and temperature were mostly stable during the period studied, the effects of population and gross domestic product (GDP) on the forest changes weakened, and the influence of land-use change markedly increased. These findings provide valuable information for resource managers engaging in forest protection, deforestation prevention, and ecological restoration in similar regions.

AB  - Soils are under threat globally, with declining soil productivity and soil health in many places. As a key indicator of soil functioning, soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for ensuring food, soil, water and energy security, together with biodiversity protection. While there is a global effort to map SOC stock and status, SOC is a dynamic soil property and can change rapidly as a function of land management and land use. Here, we introduce a semi-mechanistic model to monitor SOC stocks at a global scale, underpinned by one of the largest worldwide soil database to date. Our model generates a SOC stock baseline for the year 2001, which is then propagated through time by keeping track of annual landcover changes obtained from remote sensing products with loss and gain dynamics dependent on temperature and precipitation, which finally define the magnitude, rate and direction of the SOC changes. We estimated a global SOC stock in the top 30 cm of around 793 Pg with annual losses due to landcover change of 1.9 Pg SOC yr-1 from 2001 to 2020, 20% larger than the annual production-based emissions of the United States in 2018. The biggest losses were found in the tropic and sub-tropical regions, accounting for almost 50% of the total global loss. This is a considerable contribution to greenhouse gas emissions but it also has a direct impact on agricultural production with more than 16 million hectares yr-1 falling below critical SOC limits. The proposed modelling framework is flexible, allowing it to be updated as more remote sensing and soil data becomes available, offering a first-of-its-kind global spatio-temporal SOC stock assessment and monitoring system.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in integrated water resource planning, development and management. This process is particularly relevant in semiarid regions. The aim of this study is, hence, to compare spatial and temporal patterns of actual ET, as well as the temporal trends in two different semiarid forests, Caatinga (Brazil) and Tierra de Pinares (Spain). We used the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) to assess actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in both areas. In the Brazilian semiarid forest, Caatinga is the main vegetation, while it is Pinares in Spain. For this purpose, 69 Landsat-5 and 42 Landsat-8 images (1995-2019) were used. The Mann-Kendall test was applied to assess the occurrence of trends in precipitation, temperature and potential ET data; and the Temporal Stability Index (TSI) to know which areas have greater seasonal ETa. The annual amplitude of the potential evapotranspiration (ET0) is the same in both areas, however, the Caatinga values are higher. In the Caatinga forest, when ET0 presents its highest values throughout the year, ETa presents the lowest, and vice versa. In the Pinares forest, ETa follows the ET0 dynamics during the year, and the difference between ET0 and ETa is maximum during the summer. The Caatinga forest showed a greater spatial variation of ETa than the Pinares forest as well as a greater extension with lower temporal stability of ETa than the Pinares forest. Both the Caatinga forest and the Pinares forest showed significant positive trends in annual ET0 and ETa. We estimate that the value of ETa increases more rapidly in Pinares than in the Brazilian Caatinga. Taking Caatinga as a hydrological mirror, some consequences are expected to Pinares, such as significant changes in the water balance, increase of biodiversity vulnerability, and reduction of water availability in soil and reservoirs.

AB  - Forest fires are drivers of spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of vegetation and biodiversity. On the Canary Islands, large areas of pine forest exist, dominated by the endemic Canary Island pine, Pinus canariensis C. Sm. These mostly natural forests experience wildfires frequently. P. canariensis is well-adapted to such impacts and has the ability to re-sprout from both stems and branches. In recent decades, however, anthropogenically caused fires have increased, and climate change further enhances the likelihood of large forest fires. Through its dense, long needles, P. canariensis promotes cloud precipitation, which is an important ecosystem service for the freshwater supply of islands such as La Palma. Thus, it is important to understand the regeneration and vegetation dynamics of these ecosystems after fire. Here, we investigated species diversity patterns in the understory vegetation of P. canariensis forests after the large 2016 fire on the southern slopes of La Palma. We analyzed the effect of fire intensity, derived from Sentinel-2 NDVI differences, and of environmental variables, on species richness (alpha diversity) and compositional dissimilarity (beta diversity). We used redundancy analysis (dbRDA), Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, and variance partitioning for this analysis. Fire intensity accounted for a relatively small proportion of variation in alpha and beta diversity, while elevation was the most important predictor. Our results also reveal the important role of the endemic Lotus campylocladus ssp. hillebrandii (Christ) Sandral & D.D.Sokoloff for understory diversity after fire. Its dominance likely reduces the ability of other species to establish by taking up nutrients and water and by shading the ground. The mid- to long-term effects are unclear since Lotus is an important nitrogen fixer in P. canariensis forests and can reduce post-fire soil erosion on steep slopes.

AB  - The Yellow River Source National Park (YRSNP), one of largest alpine wetlands in China which serves as the origin of the Yellow River, is situated in the heart of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The alpine wetland ecosystem, which is its primary ecological system, is crucial for maintaining ecological balance, preserving biodiversity, and facilitating the sustainable development of the Yellow River Basin. In this study, based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform combined with Landsat 5 7 8 remote sensing images, we used a random forest classification model to identify and classify the alpine wetland from 2000 to 2020 and analyze its pattern of dynamic changes. The main driving forces that drive the change of the alpine wetland area in the YRSNP from 2000 to 2020 are identified using a random forest regression analysis in combination with data on precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and population density. The results show that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, the average overall accuracy of remote sensing classification and extraction of the YRSNP alpine wetlands is 0.8492 and the Kappa coefficient is 0.8051. (2) From 2000 to 2020, the shrinking trend of the YRSNP alpine wetland area is restrained. However, the lake wetland, marsh wetland, and marsh meadow all increase by 0.58%, 0.06%, and 3.34%, respectively, whereas the river wetland shows a declining trend. (3) The results of the identification of driving forces indicate that soil moisture is the main factor influencing the dynamic changes of the alpine wetland, although the decline in population density has a favorable impact on the alpine wetland. The results can provide scientific basis for maintaining the stability, diversity, and sustainability of the alpine wetland ecosystem in the Yellow River Source National Park.

AB  - Shrub encroachment is one of the major phenomena of grassland degradation throughout the world. One of the largest grassland areas is found in Central Asia. This area is playing an important role for biodiversity and food security, especially in a context of climate change. While sustainable land management is critical to avoid shrub encroachment, the dynamics of such encroachment are often unclear, especially in remote areas. We assessed the spatial and temporal dynamics of shrub encroachment in Suusamyr valley in Kyrgyzstan and analysed how these patterns relate to abiotic and social factors. To assess the extent of shrub encroachment we performed a random forest classification with Google Earth Engine to depict shrub encroachment between 2000 and 2019. By using a combination of vegetation indices and digital elevation derivatives in the classification model, the overall classification accuracy reaches above 90%. The mapping of temporal changes revealed an increase in shrub encroachment of 48% within the valley, adding up to an overall coverage of 2% of the grassland area. The spatial patterns of shrub encroachment are more strongly associated with anthropogenic factors, such as locations of roads and settlements, than with variations in precipitation and amount of organic carbon in soils. Around 45% of shrub encroachment occurs close to main roads and local paths, and within around 5 km distance from temporal settlements. This degradation is probably caused by overgrazing near settlements and the loss of grasslands in those areas puts additional pressure on local livestock farming, potentially leading to further degradation in neighboring areas. A shrub encroachment susceptibility map was created to identify areas vulnerable to further shrub expansion, affecting valuable grassland area. The identification of these areas at risk may inform sustainable grassland management by better allocating pastures according their capacity and reducing pressures on those places most susceptible to degradation.

AB  - Microorganisms inhabit the entire soil profile and play important roles in nutrient cycling and soil formation. Recent studies have found that soil bacterial diversity and composition differ significantly among soil layers. However, little is known about the vertical variation in soil bacterial communities and how it may change along an elevation gradient. In this study, we collected soil samples from 5 forest types along an elevation gradient in Taibai Mountain to characterize the bacterial communities and their vertical patterns and variations across soil profiles. The richness and Shannon index of soil bacterial communities decreased from surface soils to deep soils in three forest types, and were comparable among soil layers in the other two forests at the medium elevation. The composition of soil bacterial communities differed significantly between soil layers in all forest types, and was primarily affected by soil C availability. Oligotrophic members of the bacterial taxa, such as Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, Nitrospirae, and AD3, were more abundant in the deep layers. The assembly of soil bacterial communities within each soil profile was mainly governed by deterministic processes based on environmental heterogeneity. The vertical variations in soil bacterial communities differed among forest types, and the soil bacterial communities in the Betula albo-sinensis forest at the medium elevation had the lowest vertical variation. The vertical variation was negatively correlated with mean annual precipitation (MAP), weighted rock content, and weighted sand particle content in soils, among which MAP had the highest explanatory power. These results indicated that the vertical mobilization of microbes with preferential and matrix flows likely enhanced bacterial homogeneity. Overall, our results suggest that the vertical variations in soil bacterial communities differ along the elevation gradient and potentially affect soil biological processes across soil profiles.

AB  - Soil microorganisms are important for maintaining multiple functions of terrestrial ecosystems. Understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of soil microbial communities and their key determinants is one of the central goals of microbial ecology. In this study, we used an artificial ecosystem called the Ecorium, which a system with a series of biomes including tropical forest, desert, Mediterranean grassland and temperate forest. By using an artificial ecosystem, it is possible to understand the distribution of microbial communities and their key determinants under the control for potential confounds such as soil chronosequence, pedogenesis, ecosystem development stages and historical processes. Two years after construction of the Ecorium, we analyzed bacterial community structures using Illumina Miseq as well as measuring the chemical properties of the soil samples. The relationship between bacterial communities and soil chemical properties was then analyzed. Across all of the biomes, the most abundant phylum was Proteobacteria (36.0 +/- 3.0%), followed by Actinobacteria (14.6 +/- 3.1%), Bacteroidetes (12.4 +/- 0.4%) and Acidobacteria (11.7 +/- 3.2%). Bacterial alpha diversity was highest in the temperate biome and lowest in the control soil and desert biome. Bacterial community structure differed significantly between the control soil and that of the rest of the biomes, as well as among the biomes themselves. We found that the impact of climate factors was larger than that of biotic factors, such as vegetation diversity, in the structuring of bacterial communities. Soil water content appeared to be the most influential factor in determining microbial community structure. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the relationship and interaction between soil microbial ecology and environmental factors on a wide geographical scale. This information could be applied to technologies for ecosystem restoration, as well as the establishment of sustainable ecosystem management strategies and conservation policies.

AB  - Aridity is increasing in several regions because of global climate change, which strongly affects the soil microbial community. The soil pqqC-harboring bacterial community plays a vital role in soil P cycling and P availability. However, the effect of shifts in aridity on the pqqC community is largely unknown. Here, based on high-throughput sequencing technology, we investigated the response patterns of the diversity, co-occurrence networks, and assembly mechanisms of the soil pqqC communities along a natural aridity gradient in adjacent pairs of natural and disturbed grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the alpha-diversity of the pqqC community first increased and then decreased with increasing aridity in the natural grassland, while it linearly increased as aridity increased in the disturbed grassland. The pqqC community dissimilarity significantly increased with increased aridity, exhibiting a steeper change rate in the disturbed grassland than in the natural grassland. Increased aridity altered the pqqC community composition, leading to increases in the relative abundance of Actinobacteria but decreases in Proteobacteria. The composition and structure of the pqqC community showed significant differences between natural and disturbed grasslands. In addition, the network analysis revealed that aridity improved the interactions among pqqC taxa and promoted the interspecific competition of pqqC microorganisms. The pqqC community assembly was primarily governed by stochastic processes, and the relative contribution of stochastic processes increased with increasing aridity. Furthermore, disturbances could affect pqqC-harboring bacterial interactions and assembly processes. Overall, our findings fill an important knowledge gap in our understanding of the influence of aridity on the diversity and assembly mechanism of the soil pqqC community in grassland ecosystems, and this work is thus conducive to predicting the pqqC community and its ecological services in response to future climate change.

AB  - Ecological research on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has become a hotspot in recent years, and a great number of related research papers have been published. Here, a bibliometrics method was utilized to analyze 4315 papers from the Web of Science published from 1990 to 2019, and a comprehensive overview based on metrics, including the publication growth, first author' institutions and countries, research areas, international cooperation, high-impact journals and papers, and research hotspots and topics, is presented. The results revealed the following: (1) The number of published papers has grown exponentially, with China and India being the main research countries. However, China and the USA have the greatest weights in country cooperation. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has a relatively strong influence and plays the leading role in institutional cooperation. Wang Shiping, Zhang Zhenhua, Luo Caiyun, and seven other authors are highly influential. GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY is the scientific journal that has published the greatest number of papers on the subject, and 'Environmental Sciences & Ecology' is the key research area; (2) Grazing, Precipitation, Soil moisture, Aboveground biomass, and Temperature are the top five core keywords. The research hotspots were mainly ecosystem services, biodiversity research, forest protection, and ecological adaptation under the background of climate change; and (3) Both new and old research topics appear in the periods 1990-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2014, and 2015-2019, but all the periods focused on the impacts of rising temperature on natural elements, such as soil, forests, rivers, and lakes. Many recent also focused on the harmonious coexistence of human beings and nature. On the basis of these findings, some research suggestions and agendas are proposed for future research on the QTP. This is the first visualization and analysis of the hotspots and trends in ecological research on the QTP.

AB  - Tropical urban coastal wetland regeneration is complex. Wetland plant biodiversity varies due to past and present land use, nutrient inputs, hydrological conditions, and terrestrial/marine connectivity. The intensity of atmospheric disturbances, such as hurricanes, will determine these systems' level of disturbance and regeneration capacity. On September 20, 2017, category 4 hurricane Maria passed over Puerto Rico, leaving behind a path of destruction across the entire island, especially in coastal ecosystems, from the combined effects of winds, severe storm surges, and urban runoff. Our question was: to what extent do human-influenced coastal urban wetlands regenerate after such a massive event. This study determines the spatio-temporal regeneration dynamics of plant cover and composition during the first 2 years after hurricane Maria in a coastal urban wetland, cienaga Las Cucharillas, located in San Juan Bay. We assessed the distribution of plant functional types using small unmanned aerial vehicles (s-UAV) and monitored climate and environmental data (salinity, phreatic water levels, and precipitation). Wetland vegetation cover had a high recovery rate - 16 months after the hurricane, vegetation cover occupied 87% of the study area. We found a successional pattern of plant regeneration that seemed to be partly explained by the fast-slow continuum. Plants with high specific leaf area (SLA) colonized bare soil spaces first. Plant regeneration also varied according to changes in phreatic water conductivity and waterlogging. Isotopic analyses of plant species signaled high nutrient availability, increasing the system's regeneration speed. After 2 years, the wetland's plant cover and composition of functional plant types proved resilient to the initial hurricane effect and subsequent changes in conductivity and freshwater conditions. Further studies will expand how spatio-temporal conditions will affect long-term plant community dynamics.

AB  - Basin sediments from Bjerkreim, SW Norway, have been analyzed regarding pollen, plant macrofossils, chironomids, palaeomagnetism, elements, volcanic ash, and loss-on-ignition. The chronology is based on the Vedde Ash and Saksunarvatn ash layers and radiocarbon dates of plant and insect macrofossils. The records spanning the period from local deglaciation around 16 ka BP to the early Holocene ca 10.2 ka BP, have given new detailed information of the late-glacial environments. In the cold pre-Bolling (prior to 14.6 ka BP), open pioneer vegetation on unstable mineral soils was dominant. After the Bolling warming, climate became moister and reached the late-glacial thermal maximum (July mean of 12-13 degrees C), and dominant dwarf shrubs and snow beds established. Shallow soils, strong winds, and drought may have restricted vegetation development. Despite colder summers (July mean of 9.5-11 degrees C) in Allerod 13.9-12.8 ka BP, fertile humus-soils developed, and shrub vegetation and open birch-forests established. Snow beds regained dominance in Younger Dryas (July mean of 6.5-9 degrees C). The early Holocene warming initiated rapid establishment of early Betula/Populus-forests and the later Corylus forests around 10.7 ka BP. Three cooling events in the Bolling-Allerod interstadial (Older Dryas/GI-1d, G1-1c2, GI-1b/Gerzensee) temporarily increased open-ground vegetation showing the ecotonal position of Bjerkreim with low resistance to these changes. The Empetrum expansion was delayed (from 14.5 to 13.7 ka BP) towards the east along the coast of Rogaland. This could point to a precipitation/outwash gradient decreasing towards the east and developing the acid soils necessary for Empetrum to expand. For the first time, macrofossils show the late-glacial presence of tree-birch in Norway. Tree-birch were sparse in Bolling and formed patches of open-forests in Allerod. Several pollen taxa previously thought to reflect long-distance dispersal, such as Populus, Hippohae center dot, Jasione, and Sanguisorba ssp., most probably were present in Rogaland during Late-glacial. Doggerland seem to have been important for the late-glacial northwards migration of plants into South Norway.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is easily enriched in many human-disturbed watersheds, particularly lakes with poor water mobility, which is posing a threat to aquatic biota. While previous studies have focused on the concentration of BPA in water and its toxicity to aquatic organisms, a small amount of measured data is not enough to reveal the temporal and spatial distribution and threats of BPA, and estimate the ecological risk in watersheds. Therefore, we collected 164 measured BPA data points from Taihu Lake to develop machine learning models using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and least square regression (LSR) and created month-by-month watershed prediction maps in temperate lakes to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution and threats of BPA. Due to RF's superior robustness to noisy data, the RF model exhibits the best performance among the three algorithms. The RF model showed acceptable predictive performance on the modeling dataset (coefficients of determination and root-mean-square error for the training set were 0.927 and 17.499, respectively, and 0.607, 39.645 for the validation set, respectively). The maps indicated that areas susceptible to anthropogenic activities were more severely polluted by BPA, and rainy climate may favor the migration of BPA to aquatic ecosystems. The model was also applied to predict 42 data points of BPA collected from Dianchi Lake, and the results showed that most predicted data were within a factor of 10 of the measured data, but the prediction accuracy of the model has declined. The ecological risks in the two lakes were evaluated and attention should be paid to the regions with higher risks. Our study provided a novel idea for comprehensive monitoring of an unconventional trace pollutant with endocrine disrupting effects in aquatic ecosystems and analyzing their spatiotemporal distribution, which will contribute to the scientific assessment of the ecological risk of BPA.

AB  - Field tests are important for evaluating how wood performs in real-world conditions and making informed choices for material selection. These tests help assess wood's durability, strength, decay processes, and resistance against harmful organisms. Furthermore, it helps users make more informed decisions about the color of wood and understand the importance of color changes depending on the place and time of use. Because weather conditions are a significant factor that influences the color of wood. Wood that is exposed to prolonged sunlight, moisture, and rain may experience fading, darkening, or staining in its color. In this study, heartwood, sapwood, and CCB impregnated sapwood samples of Scotch pine, spruce, beech and alder were exposed to the soil contact (hazard class 4) according to EN 252 for 3 years in Trabzon, Mugla, canakkale, and Elazig provinces of Turkey with completely different climatic conditions from each other. Color parameters and color change values were evaluated using L*, a*, b* and increment E* of the samples collected from test sites. The most significant color change was observed at Scotch pine in canakkale province. Greater color changes were observed in the heartwood of coniferous species. Impregnated samples showed the least color change.

AB  - The tropical rainforest of a highly dissected low hill from the upper Itaya river basin belongs to the western Amazonia region. Some investigations on the biodiversity of these rainforests were more focused on animals and plants diversity. The soils of this region are composed of moderately fertile sediments deposited recently from the initiation of the Andean orogenesis in the Miocene until now. However, scientific information about the soil microbial and functional diversity is still missing. This report presents shotgun metagenomics sequencing data from soils of this rainforest type. A composite loamy soil sample was collected from a primary forest, and metagenomic DNA was purified with standardized methods. Furthermore, libraries were prepared and paired-end sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. Raw Illumina paired-end reads have been uploaded and analysed in the Metagenomics RAST server (MG-RAST). The raw sequence data in fastq format is available at NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) with accession number SRX12846710. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The United Nation decade on ecosystem restoration has been recognized in global and regional policy commitments that play a crucial role towards restoring degraded areas with the continued provision of ecosystem services. Climate-sensitive alpine meadows are vital in this regard as they are facing a continuous threat of degradation governed by both natural and anthropogenic drivers. The present work aims at the investigation of the ecological status and restoration strategies for alpine and sub-alpine areas of the Darma-Byans landscape in the Central Himalayan region of India. It is one of the important conservation landscapes identified under the SECURE Himalaya project of the United Nation Development Programme (UNDP). Under the present work, studies conducted regarding assessment strategies included: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) mapping, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis, grazing capacity estimation, and final validation with secondary data collection followed by the investigation of suitable eco-system based adaptation and mitigation strategies for the area. Results showed the natural regeneration of biodiversity in the alpine meadows of the landscape. Clear indications analyzed from the results depict that grazing pressure was below its capacity (20,897 cow units per year); there was a decreasing trend in human population (in 15 villages) and livestock population (from 1987 by ~50% of the total population), tourists' influx, and an increasing trend in NDVI in the area. However, the sub alpine areas are still facing the threat of extreme land degradation due to harsh climatic conditions, especially extreme rainfall events. Therefore, sustainable site-specific eco-restoration strategies, viz., grazing, under-grazing capacity, eco-tourism practice, soil erosion control by check dams and geo-coir matting followed by plantation, sustainable resource utilization management practices, shepherd's night staying sites, integrated agricultural practices, etc. are also recommended for the region.

AB  - Aims: In northwestern North America, montane meadows fed by vernal ground-flow seepage occur scattered throughout an otherwise forested landscape on shallow soils over bedrock. Although their significance for biodiversity has been known, they have never been subject to systematic scientific research and thus, are not included in regional or national vegetation classification schemes. We provide the first vegetation survey of bedrock meadows and compare them to other major non-forest vegetation types in the region.Study area: Northwestern North America (United States, Canada).Methods: We surveyed 110 plots of bedrock meadow vegetation in Montana, Idaho, and British Columbia and compared them with data from 1052 plots from six studies of other open vegetation in the region: prairie and foothill grasslands, maritime mountain, alpine, and timberline meadows. We used cluster analysis to identify groups based on vascular plant composition, related abiotic and structural characteristics to clusters using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), and compared proportions of plant growth forms and life spans.Results: Cluster analysis identified five groups, with bedrock meadows forming a distinct community. According to the NMDS, bedrock meadows had a high cover of vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens and a low cover of litter. Their climate was intermediate between maritime mountain and interior timberline meadows. A distinct functional feature of bedrock meadows was their high proportions of annual plants (therophytes) and plants regenerating from bulbs and corms (geophytes)-a functional composition they shared with maritime mountain meadows.Conclusion: Bedrock meadows have distinct floristic, functional, and environmental features, are important hotspots for biodiversity, and host several rare plant species. They are an important habitat for conservation and environmental impact assessment and should be incorporated into regional and national classification schemes. Future research priority should be given to understanding their spatial extent, ecological functioning, and drivers of non-vascular and vascular species richness.

AB  - The Amazon rainforest accounts for one-third of the world's tropical forest area. This makes it indispensable for the maintenance of global biodiversity. However, there has been a notorious increase in the occurrence of fires and deforestation in the region. Deforestation damages the entire planet, and protecting the forests is essential to guarantee the quality of life for the next generations. This paper presents the results of the application of the Inventor software in the development of a project for a device capable of monitoring remote regions like the Amazon Forest and preservation areas. For example, detecting logging in the Amazon Forest can be a challenge due to its forest extension and the difficulties of access to some areas. The system once built should be able to identify chainsaw and tractor noise through artificial intelligence and send an alert using LoRaWan communication. In this work, the development of the mechanical design of this device is presented; the results obtained are rooted precisely in obtaining both 3D designs and 2D layouts or details of all the component parts of the equipment that allowed building and testing it with positive results in the different tests required.

AB  - The nematode Pearsonema plica is a parasite infecting the urinary bladder of carnivores, with a described prevalence ranging from 1 to 90%. This parasite needs earthworms as intermediate host to complete its life cycle, being the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) a definitive host. The objective of this study was to analyse the prevalence and intensity of P. plica in the red fox population from the Region of Murcia (SE Spain), an area with semi-arid Mediterranean climate. The urinary bladder, kidneys and ureters of 167 red foxes were collected at necropsy, opened and observed to detect adult parasites. The influence of host variables (sex, age and body condition using Kidney Fat Index) and environmental variables (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Moisture Index, Bare Soil Index, temperature, radiation, evapotranspiration, precipitation, Corine Land Cover categories and distance to urban areas) were evaluated using a Generalised Linear Model. Moran index was used to evaluate the parasite spatial aggregation. The prevalence found was very low (2.4%; median abundance 0 nematodes per fox; median intensity 7.5 nematodes per parasitized fox), which contrast with those described in other red fox populations in Europe. Environmental variables had a significant influence on the occurrence of P. plica, being NDMI, mean summer precipitation, percentage of forest and agricultural areas positively associ-ated with P. plica abundance. The south-eastern Iberian Peninsula has a semi-arid climate that hinders the development of the life cycle of this nematode, which justifies its occurrence in specific areas where there are the suitable environmental conditions for the presence of earthworms. However, although semi-arid Mediterranean areas do not seem to be favourable carnivores to be parasitized by P. plica, we cannot underestimate the risk that exists in those areas where, either naturally or by human activity, there are environmental factors that favor the presence of this nematode.

AB  - Global changes in nutrient deposition rates and habitat fragmentation are likely to have profound effects on plant communities, particularly in the nutrient-limited systems of the tropics and subtropics. However, it remains unclear how increased phosphorus (P) supply affects seedling growth in P-deficient subtropical fragmented forests. To explore this, we applied P to 11 islands in a subtropical Chinese archipelago and examined the results in combination with a contemporary greenhouse experiment to test the influence of P addition on seedling growth and survival. We measured the growth (i.e., base area) and mortality rate of seedlings for one arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and one ectomycorrhizal (EcM) tree species separately and calculated their relative growth rate and mortality when compared with P addition and control treatment on each island. We also measured three functional traits and the biomass of seedlings in the greenhouse experiment. Results showed that P addition significantly increased the mortality of AM and EcM seedlings and reduced the growth rate of EcM seedlings. The relative growth rate of AM seedlings, but not EcM seedlings, significantly decreased as the island area decreased, suggesting that P addition could promote the relative growth rate of AM seedlings on larger islands. The greenhouse experiment showed that P addition could reduce the specific root length of AM and EcM seedlings and reduce the aboveground and total biomass of seedlings, indicating that P addition may affect the resource acquisition of seedlings, thereby affecting their survival and growth. Our study reveals the synergistic influence of habitat fragmentation and P deposition, which may affect the regeneration of forest communities and biodiversity maintenance in fragmented habitats.

AB  - Biological invasions drive biodiversity loss and ecosystem change on tropical islands. However, we know little about the implications of species losses on the functional structure of both resident and novel communities. Herein, we examined the potential effect of a non-native palm species, Pinanga coronata, on the taxonomic and functional assemblages of understory plant species in a Fijian rainforest. We predicted that competition from this invasive species would lead to trait convergence according to the competitive hierarchy hypothesis. Using a trait-based approach, we sampled plant communities in 280 plots across a gradient of P. coronata densities. We measured five functional traits, including height and leaf traits related to nutrient acquisition. We found that an increase in P. coronata density is strongly correlated with a decrease in taxonomic diversity (i.e., about - 50% for species richness and - 33% for Shannon diversity index) and a decrease in functional richness. Community-weighted mean values of traits of resident species (i.e., excluding P. coronata) converged toward competitive strategies such as higher leaf nitrogen content (LNC), lower carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratios and leaf dry matter content (LDMC), a pattern that is significantly non-random for LDMC and C:N. This study demonstrates that P. coronata might act as a strong biotic filter responsible for species loss and functional changes. Our findings suggest that in response to increasing competition with this invasive plant, resident and novel plant communities shift toward less diverse and more competitive assemblages. Nevertheless, the intensity of this filtering is habitat dependent (e.g. less filtering effect under mahogany trees). Lastly, changes in resource acquisition strategies (mainly nutrient-based) in particular in low nutrient status of rainforest soils, could lead to long-term impacts on tree regeneration, in turn causing large-scale changes in ecosystem properties.

AB  - Coastal wetlands surrounding urban environments provide many important ecosystem services including protection from coastal erosion, soil carbon sequestration and habitat for marine and terrestrial fauna. Their persistence with sea-level rise depends upon their capacity to increase their soil surface elevation at a rate comparable to the rate of sea-level rise. Both sediment and organic matter from plant growth contribute to gains in soil surface elevation, but the importance of these components varies among sites and with variation in climate over long time scales, for which monitoring is seldom available. Here, we analysed variation in surface elevation, surface accretion and mangrove tree growth over 15 years in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, a period that spans variation in the El Nino/La Nina (ENSO) cycle, which strongly influences rainfall and sea level in the region. Piecewise structural equation models were used to assess the effects of biotic (tree growth, plant cover and bioturbation by invertebrates) and environmental factors on annual surface elevation increments throughout this period. Our model for mangroves identified that surface accretion and tree growth were both positively influenced by rainfall, but surface elevation was not, and thus, higher levels of compaction of the soil profile in high rainfall/high sea level years were inferred. In contrast, our saltmarsh model found that rainfall positively influenced surface accretion and elevation gains. Declines in surface elevation in the mangroves were influenced by the species composition of the mangrove, with higher levels of elevation loss occurring in mangrove forests dominated by Avicennia marina compared to those with a higher proportion of Rhizophora stylosa. Decadal-scale variation in ENSO affected mangrove tree growth, but surface elevation trends were more strongly influenced by variation in environmental conditions than by tree growth, although effects of biotic factors (mangrove species composition and bioturbation) on surface elevation trends were observed. Further research into tipping points with extreme ENSO events (either La Nina with high rainfall and high sea level or El Nino with low rainfall and low sea levels) will help clarify the future of mangrove and saltmarsh distribution within Moreton Bay.

AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are thin microbiological vegetation layers that naturally develop in unfavorable higher plant conditions (i.e., low precipitation rates and high temperatures) in global drylands. They consist of poikilohydric organisms capable of adjusting their metabolic activities depending on the water availability. However, they, and with them, their ecosystem functions, are endangered by climate change and land-use intensification. Remote sensing (RS)-based studies estimated the BSC cover in global drylands through various multispectral indices, and few of them correlated the BSCs' activity response to rainfall. However, the allocation of BSCs is not limited to drylands only as there are areas beyond where smaller patches have developed under intense human impact and frequent disturbance. Yet, those areas were not addressed in RS-based studies, raising the question of whether the methods developed in extensive drylands can be transferred easily. Our temperate climate study area, the 'Lieberoser Heide' in northeastern Germany, is home to the country's largest BSC-covered area. We applied a Random Forest (RF) classification model incorporating multispectral Sentinel-2 (S2) data, indices derived from them, and topographic information to spatiotemporally map the BSC cover for the first time in Central Europe. We further monitored the BSC response to rainfall events over a period of around five years (June 2015 to end of December 2020). Therefore, we combined datasets of gridded NDVI as a measure of photosynthetic activity with daily precipitation data and conducted a change detection analysis. With an overall accuracy of 98.9%, our classification proved satisfactory. Detected changes in BSC activity between dry and wet conditions were found to be significant. Our study emphasizes a high transferability of established methods from extensive drylands to BSC-covered areas in the temperate climate. Therefore, we consider our study to provide essential impulses so that RS-based biocrust mapping in the future will be applied beyond the global drylands.

AB  - Afforestation is widely acknowledged as an effective approach for enhancing ecological conditions. Considering the challenging ecological environment on the Loess Plateau, prioritizing soil and water conservation functions in stands is crucial. The study aimed to ascertain the future development direction of forestry on the Loess Plateau by examining two representative forest types: planted forest (Robinia pseudoacacia pure forest and Pinus tabulaeformis pure forest), and natural secondary forest (a mixed forest of Quercus liaotungensis and Populus davidiana). The assessment centered on the soil and water conservation functions of the two forest types, encompassing the water conservation function (rainfall distribution and changes in multi-year soil moisture storage (0-200 cm)), soil conservation function (soil physicochemical properties), and understory plant diversity and stability. The results indicated that natural secondary forests outperformed planted forests in terms of water conservation function by effectively converting more precipitation into soil moisture, reducing runoff, and maintaining higher soil moisture storage. Additionally, natural secondary forests exhibited superior soil conservation functions compared to planted forests, characterized by higher soil porosity and nutrient properties. The variation in community structure between the shrub and herbaceous layers was more significant among different forests than within each forest (P < 0.05). Natural secondary forests exhibited higher understory shrub and herb biodiversity and interspecific repeatability compared to planted forests. Therefore, natural secondary forests are a more suitable forest type considering the natural conditions and silvicultural objectives of the Loess Plateau. To enhance the quality of afforestation, it is recommended to adopt near-natural planting patterns that replicate the environmental conditions of natural forests. For instance, actively creating mixed forests that emulate the tree species composition of natural forests and gradually reducing dependence on a single dominant tree species. Furthermore, the arborous and litter layers had a more direct and substantial influence on soil and water conservation functions compared to the shrub and herb layers. Foresters should prioritize regulating stand structure, such as increasing canopy variability, to enhance the water conservation function of stands. Additionally, they should actively protect the understory litter to fulfill its role in enhancing soil quality. This study provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the implementation of vegetation restoration in ecologically vulnerable areas, such as the Loess Plateau.

AB  - Aim Although land use change is a leading cause of biodiversity loss worldwide, there is scant information on the extent to which it has affected the structure and composition of bird communities in the Afrotropical region. This study aimed to quantify the effects of habitat transformation on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity in Afrotropical bird communities. Location Nyungwe landscape, a montane rainforest with adjoining farmland in south-west Rwanda. Methods Data on bird occurrence, abundance and functional traits were collected in 2017/18 using point counts. We also collected data on habitat and morphological traits for all bird species recorded. We quantified bird diversity using a range of metrics, including the inverse Simpson index, functional dispersion and the standardized effect size of mean nearest taxon distance. Results In comparison with primary forest areas, even low levels of land use change altered species composition and reduced species diversity. Although overall functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity were similar across land use types, we found a significant contraction of trophic and locomotory trait structures of bird communities in restored areas and cultivated areas, respectively. Soil moisture, elevation and lower vegetation height were major factors influencing taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic dimensions of bird communities, although their effects varied across these dimensions. Main conclusions The sensitivity of forest species to minor habitat disturbance emphasizes the value of conserving primary vegetation. Long-term conservation of bird communities in Afromontane ecosystems requires halting wide-scale destruction of primary forest, promoting vegetation heterogeneity in the ecological restoration of degraded habitats and adopting wildlife-friendly agricultural practices. Our results suggest that monitoring and conservation in these landscapes can be refined using taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity metrics to provide complementary information about the current and likely future impacts of land use change.

AB  - Tardigrades are common in many terrestrial environments and habitats. Although little is known on their ecological preferences, previous studies found diversity and community composition significantly affected by various variables. This study associated tardigrade species' records with climatic variables, forest type, and substrate categories exploring tardigrade diversity and species communities to find associations with ecological characteristics of Norwegian forests.A total of 17 473 specimens were identified, encompassing 131 species (including putatively new species) from 305 samples of different substrates (leaf litter, bryophytes, and lichens). Bryophytes and lichens of samples were classified according to the main species, and growth form, and associated with tardigrade species and sample metadata. Tardigrade species' richness was related to climatic variables and forest type, increased with precipitation, decreased with summer temperature, and not varied with precipitation seasonality. Although there was an unbalanced representation of substrate categories in the different forest types, some tendencies were detectable. Mixed oak and birch forests reached the highest species' richness. Tardigrade community composition varied between substrate categories and, to a lesser degree, between forest types, but not with climatic variables. Our study highlights the importance of large-scale variables on tardigrade diversity, and substrate categories for tardigrade community composition.

AB  - Tropical forests stand out among forest domains, due to their wide diversity of flora and fauna. However, these areas concentrate a large number of the forest fires that occur annually on the planet. In this context, the present study performs spatial modeling of the normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI) in the Central Atlantic Forest Corridor during past (2001-2020) and future (2021-2040) periods to identify the relationship between drought and forest fires. Fire foci data, soil moisture, and data from the MOD09A1 product were used to obtain the NMDI. Rainfall and mean air temperature data from the past and for different future scenarios (SSP126 and SSP585) were also used. The autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) was used for modeling the NMDI. The results found indicate a recurrence of fire in the CAFC during the period of 2001-2020. Future data indicate reductions in rainfall and an increase in temperature in the CAFC area. The NMDI data indicate that the central region of the corridor is the driest and, among the priority areas for conservation, the Ilha do Lameirao Municipal ecological station has the lowest index values. Future modeling indicates the drought intensifying in the coming years in the corridor area. The CAFC is an extremely important area for the maintenance of Atlantic Forest remnants; however, this area continues to suffer disturbances and without the adoption of public policies, these disturbances could compromise the conservation of natural resources.

AB  - Old growth is a critical growth stage in many forest types globally. It has many key ecological roles including biodiversity conservation, carbon storage and the provision of services such as water production. The extent of old growth forest has been declining in many ecosystems around the world, with major ecological and ecosystem service consequences. Important insights about such declines, as well as the structure, function and conservation of old growth forest, can be gained from detailed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of different age cohorts within a given forest ecosystem. In this review article, we outline key insights into the characteristics of, and threats to old growth forests, using the Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria, south-eastern Australia as a detailed case study. These forests are dominated by the tallest flowering plants on earth and have been subject to several decades of intense study. These studies show that old growth Mountain Ash forests are characterized by (among other features): giant trees (approaching 100 m tall and sometimes exceeding 20 m in circumference), numerous trees with hollows, an understorey of Acacia and rainforest trees, a range of plant and animal species that are rare or absent in younger aged stands, and moist, nutrient-rich soils. The area of old growth Mountain Ash forest has declined to 1.16% of the similar to 141,000 ha area occupied by ash-type forests in the Central Highlands region. This is up to 60 times less than it was at the time of European colonization similar to 220 years ago. The loss of old growth has major implications for bird, mammal and other biodiversity, as well as for carbon storage and water production for human consumption. The main drivers of old growth decline are recurrent wildfire, widespread clearcutting, and a logging-fire interaction in which cut and then regenerated forests become more flammable and are at significantly elevated risk of burning at high (stand replacing) severity. Climate change is also a driver of old growth decline both through elevating the mortality of large old living trees and underpinning an increase in the frequency of high severity wildfire. These interacting drivers mean that restoring old growth Mountain Ash forest will be an ecological and policy challenge. We argue that a first step must be to cease all commercial logging in the Mountain Ash ecosystem to allow new cohorts of old growth forest to be recruited and thereby expand the extent of the old growth estate. In addition, the Government of Victoria should revert to a past definition of old growth that made it easier for forest to qualify for protection. Given there are high risks of recurrent high-severity wildfire in the existing Mountain Ash forest estate which is dominated by highly flammable young regrowth forest, new technologies (such as the use of drones and satellites) are needed to rapidly detect and then suppress ignitions before fires become large and difficult to control. Mountain Ash forests have provided an important natural laboratory for understanding the dynamics, management and conservation of old growth forest. They have also helped generate some valuable general perspectives likely to be relevant to other forest ecosystems globally.
   These include: (1) the critical value of multi-facetted cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in quantifying attributes of, and threats to, old growth forest, (2) the need for a carefully crafted definition of old growth that will typically be ecosystem-specific and based on the time required to develop key ecosystem attributes (e.g., large old trees), (3) the importance of rigorous protection measures because poor decisions that result in the loss of old growth now will take prolonged periods to rectify, and (4) setting protection levels that are relative to the existing spatial coverage of remaining old growth and the extent and impacts of stressors driving old growth decline.

AB  - Key message Defoliation significantly affected biomass allocation of Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Sophora japonica L., but leaf physiology readjusted to control levels at the end of the experiment. Considering carbon or sink limitation and relative height growth rate, defoliated R. pseudoacacia grew faster than S. japonica under well-watered conditions, while defoliated S. japonica and R. pseudoacacia had similar performance under drought conditions. Context Climate change may result in increases of both drought intensity and insect survival, thereby affecting both exotic and native trees in warm temperate forests. Aims In this study, we examined the interaction effects of defoliation and drought on an exotic species Robinia pseudoacacia and a native species Sophora japonica in a warm temperate area, to provide a theoretical basis for predicting the distribution and dynamics of the two species under future climate change. Methods In a greenhouse, both species were exposed to three soil moisture (75%, 55%, and 35% of field capacity) and three defoliation treatments (no defoliation, 50% defoliation, and 100% defoliation). Leaf physiology, biomass, and non-structural carbohydrate were determined. Results Leaf physiology of defoliated trees did not differ from controls trees, but defoliated seedlings allocated relatively more resources to the leaves at the end of the experiment. In well-watered conditions, defoliated R. pseudoacacia was not carbon or sink limited and defoliated S. japonica was carbon limited, while defoliated individuals of the two species were sink limited under drought. Defoliated R. pseudoacacia grow more rapidly than S. japonica in well-watered conditions. Defoliated R. pseudoacacia had a similar growth rate to S. japonica in drought. Conclusions Defoliation clearly affects biomass allocation of the two species, but not leaf physiology. Considering the carbon or sink limitation, the growth of S. japonica and R. pseudoacacia may be limited by future global climate change scenarios.

AB  - A significant portion of the harvested land base in western Canada is becoming old enough or entering a phase where thinning is a legitimate forest management option. A comprehensive review of the existing knowledge of commercial thinning (CT) treatments applied to pine and spruce-dominated stands in Alberta was conducted, with particular regard to the intensity, timing of interventions, method, and impacts on crop tree growth responses. Although the geographical focus of this review is Alberta, information on this topic is more complete in other areas of North America and Europe, where there is a long history of density management. In areas of eastern North America, our review revealed that CT from below, with tree removal levels from 27 to 43% of the basal area, could increase total merchantable wood produced from 11 to 60 m(3) ha(-1) over a rotation, depending on stand age and intensity of thinning. For Alberta conditions, and considering the risks, we conclude that commercial thinning basal area removal should be in the range of 25 to 40%, depending on a variety of factors such as species, wind firmness, and insect or disease incidence and risk. Thinning too aggressively and/or too late will increase the blowdown risk but the literature is fairly consistent in suggesting that live crown ratios should be >40% to maximize the chance of growth response and minimize the blowdown risk. In cases where stands are also threatened by stressors such as drought, wind, and insect or disease outbreaks, CT treatments likely offer the potential at limiting the overall risk, but localized knowledge and experience are critical. It is intended that the information presented may support ongoing and future research trials and growth and yield (G & Y) model development about potential CT treatments to apply and the likely results of practical application to commercial forestry.

AB  - The death syndrome of marandu grass (Brachiaria brizantha) is one of the main problems in the degradation of pastures in the Amazon biome. Plant death occurs during the rainy season due to susceptibility to phytopathogens. Thus, the objective was to study production systems and select bacteria antagonistic to Fusarium spp., one of the phytopathogenic agents. Bacterial isolates were obtained from 10 production systems, native forest and fallow, in rain and drought season. Molecular characterization of isolates was carried out by sequencing. Two Fusarium isolates were assessed. For pathogen 1, in the rainy season, 7.5% of the isolates showed antagonism, while in the dry season it was 15%. For pathogen 2, not all isolates positive for pathogen 1 were efficient in the control, showing correlations between bacterial isolates and Fusarium spp. In the rain, for pathogen 1, the forest showed the highest number of positive isolates (20%). In the dry season, the treatments forest, 1-Forest and 8-plant-forest integration for pathogen 1, were ones with the highest number of positives (25%). In the molecular identification, 8 bacterial genera were found: Burkholderia, Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, Escherichia, Paenibacillus and Pandoraea, most of which are described as able to controlling Fusarium spp. in vitro.

AB  - Although cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is probably the most promising noninvasive proximal soil moisture measurement technique at the field scale, its application for hydrological simulations remains underexplored in the literature so far. This study assessed the use of CRNS to inversely calibrate soil hydraulic parameters at the intermediate field scale to simulate the groundwater recharge rates at a daily timescale. The study was conducted for two contrasting hydrological years at the Guaraira experimental basin, Brazil, a 5.84-km(2), a tropical wet and rather flat landscape covered by secondary Atlantic forest. As a consequence of the low altitude and proximity to the equator low neutron count rates could be expected, reducing the precision of CRNS while constituting unexplored and challenging conditions for CRNS applications. Inverse calibration for groundwater recharge rates was used based on CRNS or point-scale soil moisture data. The CRNS-derived retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity were consistent with the literature and locally performed slug tests. Simulated groundwater recharge rates ranged from 60 to 470 mm yr(-1), corresponding to 5 and 29% of rainfall, and correlated well with estimates based on water table fluctuations. In contrast, the estimated results based on inversive point-scale datasets were not in alignment with measured water table fluctuations. The better performance of CRNS-based estimations of field-scale hydrological variables, especially groundwater recharge, demonstrated its clear advantages over traditional invasive point-scale techniques. Finally, the study proved the ability of CRNS as practicable in low altitude, tropical wet areas, thus encouraging its adoption for water resources monitoring and management.

The methodology employs remote sensing cloud processing and utilizes an estimator to incorporate vegetation indices. The results reveal significant changes in biomass values among land use and land cover classes over the past ten years, with notable variations observed in forest plantation, pasture, sugar cane, and soybean areas. The estimated AGB values range from 0 to 20 Mg.ha-1 (minimum), 53 to 419 Mg.ha-1 (maximum), and 19 to 57 Mg.ha-1 (mean). In Forest formation areas, AGB values range from approximately 0 to 278 Mg.ha-1, with an average annual value of 56.44 Mg.ha-1. This study provides valuable insights for rural landowners and government officials in managing the semiarid territory and environment. It aids in decision making regarding agricultural management, irrigation and fertilization practices, agricultural productivity, land use and land cover changes, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, conservation strategies, the identification of priority areas for environmental restoration, and the optimization of resource utilization.

AB  - The home-field advantage (HFA) hypothesis establishes that plant litter decomposes faster at 'home' sites than in 'away' sites due to more specialized decomposers acting at home sites. This hypothesis has predominantly been tested through 'yes or no' transplanting experiments, where the litter decomposition of a focal species is quantified near and away from their conspecifics. Herein, we evaluated the occurrence and magnitude of home-field effects on the leaf litter decomposition of Myrcia ramuliflora (O.Berg) N. Silveira (Myrtaceae) along a natural gradient of conspecific litterfall input and also if home-field effects are affected by litter and soil traits. Litter decomposition of M. ramuliflora was assessed through litterbags placed in 39 plots in a tropical heath vegetation over a period of 12 months. We also characterized abiotic factors, litter layer traits, and litter diversity. Our results indicated the occurrence of positive (i.e. Home-field advantage) and negative (i.e. Home-field disadvantage) effects in more than half of the plots. Positive and negative effects occurred in a similar frequency and magnitude. Among all predictors tested, only the community weighted mean C/N ratio of the litterfall input was associated with home-field effects. Our results reinforce the lack of generality for home-field effects found in the literature and thus challenge the understanding of litter-decomposer interaction in tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Hurricanes alter forest habitat by opening the canopy and depositing fresh wood and leaves. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of hurricane and drought-driven changes to forests on green litter decomposition, invertebrate communities, and nutrient mineralization over a short period (6 months) after disturbance. We used three complete replicated blocks with two canopy treatments: control and trim + detritus. Green leaves were enclosed in litterbags of three different mesh sizes to determine the effect of soil fauna of varying body sizes. Litterbags were retrieved from the field after 21, 35, 84, and 168 days and transported to the laboratory in individually sealed plastic bags. We extracted and identified invertebrates, measured leached and mineralized litter nutrients using ion resin membranes placed for 1 week under the leaves inside the litterbags, and determined litter mass loss. Additional resin membranes were placed in the lowest litter layer above the mineral soil. The number of arthropod taxonomic groups and nutrient mineralization differed significantly between control and trim + detritus. Regardless of mesh size, bags in control plots had consistently higher invertebrate richness than in trim + detritus plots. Nitrogen mineralization and phosphorous mineralization were significantly higher in trim + detritus in large mesh size, and decomposer arthropod abundance was highest in large-sized mesh bags. These data suggest that within functional categories, variations in feeding behavior among arthropod orders may affect the release of nutrients from organic matter. Percent mass loss did not differ between canopy treatments or litterbag mesh sizes, but instead decreased during drought. Invertebrate composition, but not abundance, differed significantly between canopy treatments with greater dominance by shredders (Lepidoptera and Diptera larvae) in trim + detritus, which corresponded to higher rates of nutrient mineralization from green leaves. These results suggest that regional drought dominated the mesoclimate surpassing any microclimate variation in response to canopy treatments. Since mass loss did not differ between canopy treatments or litterbag mesh sizes, our results suggest that differences in short-term nutrient fluxes from green litter are mostly related to changes in the litter invertebrate food web rather than rates of decomposition.

AB  - The seed rain (SR) is characterized by the arrival of propagules to the soil, caused by dispersion mechanisms and is essential to the natural regeneration dynamics of forests. The objective was to evaluate SR as an indicator of three restoration areas in the municipalities of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Ivinhema 12 years (IV-12), Jatef 13 years (JA-13) e Caarapo 16 years of planting (CA-16). Fifteen 0.64 m(2) collectors were randomly installed in each area and the material collected monthly from May 2015 to January 2016. The Shannon index (H') and Pielou Equability (J') were calculated and the seeds classified as dispersion syndrome, habit and successional class of tree species seeds. A total of 47,124 propagules were identified. For CA-16, 27.033 seeds, 29 families, 39 genera and 41 species were sampled. The JA-13 obtained 8,056 seeds, 22 families, 32 genera and 33 species. The area IV-12 resulted in 12,035 seeds, 13 families, 21 genera and 22 species. From the 61 species found, 88.5% are arboreal. Referring to the dispersion syndrome, most are zoochoric, with emphasis on IV-12 with 93.7%, being 40.9% allochthonous and from animals. Concerning to the successional class, the pioneers were prominent, mainly for the IV-12 (91.7%). The SR can be considered a good indicator for assessing the environmental integrity of areas in restoration by providing subsidies for understanding the maintenance of ecological processes, since in the evaluated areas, most of the seeds were zoochoric species, with expressive contribution of allochthonous species, demonstrating the existence of a dispersal fauna facilitating the forest succession.

AB  - Dung beetles are recognized as providers of important ecosystem functions, most of which are derived from the removal of vertebrate dung from the soil surface. These insects occur in nearly all terrestrial biomes but are most diverse in the humid tropics. Several of the ecological functions attributed to dung beetles are related to their direct and indirect interactions with plants. Among these functions, the secondary dispersal of seeds defecated by mammals has received the most attention in tropical forests. Nonetheless, while several aspects of secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles are relatively well understood, others remain understudied or have not been addressed at all. Thus, a broad generalization about the effects of secondary seed dispersal by dung beetles on plant fitness remains somewhat elusive. Furthermore, other effects of dung beetle activity on tropical plants have received very little attention. A few studies have shown that through their behaviors of dung burial and soil-excavation, dung beetles can shape seed bank structure and dynamics. Also, though numerous greenhouse studies and field experiments in agricultural lands and temperate grasslands have shown that dung beetle activity increases plant nutrient uptake and yield, it is uncertain whether such effects are common in tropical forests. Here, we review and synthesize our current knowledge on how dung beetles affect tropical forest plants by dispersing defecated seeds, shaping the structure and dynamics of seed banks, and influencing the performance of understory seedlings. We focus on the Neotropics, where most studies on the effects of dung beetles on tropical forest plants have been carried out, but we also show results from other regions and biomes, to present a more general picture of these beetle-plant interactions. Throughout the review we emphasize aspects that need more research to allow generalizations and point out those questions that remain unanswered. We hope that this review will stimulate more research about the fascinating interactions between dung beetles and plants in tropical ecosystems.

AB  - Collembola are among the most abundant and diverse soil animals contributing significantly to major ecosystem processes. Global climate changes in temperature and precipitation are likely to affect their community structure and functioning and this is likely to differ along altitudinal gradients. In this study, changes in richness, abundance, and body size of onychiurin Collembola with altitude have been investigated in the Changbai Mountain range of northeast China. Sampling was carried out on a 30 km long transect along forested slopes of the Changbai Mountains. Standardized samples were taken from 800 to 1700 m at seven altitudinal levels. More than 5000 specimens of Onychiurinae representing 13 species were collected, making Onychiuridae (with the sole subfamily Onychiurinae in Changbai) the most abundant Collembolan family in the area. The number of species of Onychiurinae slightly increased along the altitudinal gradient. The average number of species per sample, but not the total abundance, changed significantly but not monotonically with altitude. Body size of Onychiurinae species decreased significantly with increasing altitude contradicting Bergmann's rule. Furthermore, the abundance of the three body-size groups differentially responded to increasing altitude, with the abundance of the large body-size group decreasing and the abundance of the small body-size group increasing. Our results suggest that the distribution patterns of Collembola along the altitudinal gradient are complicated and may be linked to taxonomic groups and bioclimatic zones.

AB  - Three-River-Source (TRS) National Park stands as one of China's earliest established national parks, dedicated to significant ecological responsibilities that include conserving soil and water resources in the Tibetan Plateau region. Research on climate change's influence on the TRS region's grasslands is of great significance in our efforts to comprehend and conserve the grassland ecosystem. The most effective random forest (RF) model was chosen to invert the aboveground biomass (AGB) of grassland in the previous 6 years (2015-2020) and predict the grassland AGB in the following 20 years (2021-2040) by comparing linear regression and multivariate nonlinear regression models such as RF, support vector machine, decision tree, and artificial neural network. A Theil-Sen median trend analysis and a Mann-Kendal test were then used to examine the trends of grassland AGB. The results showed that (1) RF outperformed other models in estimating grassland AGB, with a test set decision coefficient of multiple determination (R2) of 0.722, a root mean square error of 42.596 g/m2, and a mean absolute error of 35.619 g/m2; (2) over 6 years, the grassland AGB in TRS National Park had a spatial trend of a steady rise from the northwest to the southeast. The average annual grassland AGB was 247.333 g/m2, with averages of 44.836 g/m2, 92.601 g/m2, and 120.217 g/m2 in the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Lancang River source parks respectively. The trend of the grassland AGB was primarily stabilized and slightly recovered, with a small portion of the slightly deteriorated areas; (3) climate change significantly affected grassland AGB, and when temperature and precipitation conditions were adequate, grassland AGB values increased with temperature and precipitation. In the scenarios of ssp119, ssp245, and ssp585, grassland AGB is projected to exhibit a dynamic upward trend over the next 20 years. Global warming is expected to boost grassland AGB. Comprehensive measures are essential to maintain grassland health and ensure a positive impact on global carbon and ecological balance. The study's findings hold great importance for the ecological security of the TRS region and contribute to our global understanding of sustainable grassland development.

AB  - Jatropha curcas L. has more attention from researchers and policymakers as an inexpensive source for produce biofuel to reduce environmental pollution by fossil fuel in the next decades without competing for lands and freshwater currently used for food production. Jatropha is a perennial deciduous, succulent oilseed shrub, belonging to family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Central and South America. It is a multipurpose shrub, each part of the plant can be used for various purposes, Jatropha produces flowers throughout the year and enables multiple harvests, while, in arid and semi-arid regions it is harvesting twice time per year.
   Jatropha is a drought-tolerant plant that could be growing under malnutrition conditions, and in different climatic conditions; therefore, it is proper plant for developing marginal lands and rural areas.
   Due to the growing demand for biofuel, jatropha cultivation has received more attention to providing seeds. While, there are various aspects of using jatropha include use as a traditional medicine for treating skin ailments, as a hedge for protecting other crops, to reduce soil degradation, combating desertification, and deforestation, also, jatropha cultivation protects the environment through using wastewater in irrigation and reduce sequester carbon dioxide.
   Conventional propagation of Jatropha propagated by seeds or stem cutting which is a more satisfactory technique to produce high-yielding seedlings, while, tissue culture method used in propagation but on small scale.
   Jatropha curcas L. contains mixtures of numerous active substances in all parts of the plant, which are used as biopesticides, larvicides, fungicide, and nematicide; also extracts are used as pesticides for whiteflies and termites.
   Jatropha crude oil is used for industrial purposes like manufacturing candles, soaps, varnishes, and as a lubricant; also press seedcake is used to produce biogas and organic fertilizers. Jatropha propagated by seeds or stem cutting which is more applicable techniques to produce high-yielding seedlings, also, tissue culture method used in propagation but on small scale for scientific work.

AB  - IntroductionPlant diversity and soil microbial diversity are important driving factors in sustaining ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) in terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about the relative importance of plant diversity, soil microbial diversity, and soil microbial network complexity to EMF in tropical rainforests.MethodsThis study took the tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China as the research object, and quantified various ecosystem functions such as soil organic carbon stock, soil nutrient cycling, biomass production, and water regulation in the tropical rainforest to explore the relationship and effect of plant diversity, soil microbial diversity, soil microbial network complexity and EMF.ResultsOur results exhibited that EMF decreased with increasing liana species richness, soil fungal diversity, and soil fungal network complexity, which followed a trend of initially increasing and then decreasing with soil bacterial diversity while increasing with soil bacterial network complexity. Soil microbial diversity and plant diversity primarily affected soil nutrient cycling. Additionally, liana species richness had a significant negative effect on soil organic carbon stocks. The random forest model suggested that liana species richness, soil bacterial network complexity, and soil fungal network complexity indicated more relative importance in sustaining EMF. The structural equation model revealed that soil bacterial network complexity and tree species richness displayed the significantly positive effects on EMF, while liana species richness significantly affected EMF via negative pathway. We also observed that soil microbial diversity indirectly affected EMF through soil microbial network complexity. Soil bulk density had a significant and negative effect on liana species richness, thus indirectly influencing EMF. Simultaneously, we further found that liana species richness was the main indicator of sustaining EMF in a tropical rainforest, while soil bacterial diversity was the primary driving factor.DiscussionOur findings provide new insight into the relationship between biodiversity and EMF in a tropical rainforest ecosystem and the relative contribution of plant and soil microibal diversity to ecosystem function with increasing global climate change.

AB  - Climate change is responsible for the negative effects on human life causing a decrease in agricultural products availability, biodiversity, soil fertility, and forest areas. Moreover, climate change increases plant diseases and pests, the cost of agricultural production and risk in food security. This study aims to determine whether climate change is a phenomenon via the analysis of the perceptions of the farmers regarding this issue in the Mersin province conducted through 251 questionnaires. Farmers primarily perceive climate change through production costs and the reduction in yield. Moreover, they are highly aware of its relation to natural events such as floods, drought, and storms. Nevertheless, inappropriate agricultural practices too have led to the negative consequences caused by climate change. In this respect, this study has revealed that farmers with strong cooperative partnerships and experience perceived climate change significantly.

AB  - There has been widespread clearance of tropical forests for agriculture, but in many cases the cultivation phase is only transient. The secondary forests recovering on these abandoned sites may contribute to mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and protection of biodiversity, but the rates of recovery may be dependent on land-use intensity and changes in soil properties during cultivation. However fine-scale details on these changes are poorly known for many tropical forest locations. We quantified soil properties and recovery of woody biomass in 42 tropical forest fragments representing a chronosequence following two types of agricultural land-uses, and in 15 comparable reference old growth forests, between the Andes and the Amazon in Peru. Soil fertility, particularly base cation concentrations, responded negatively to increasing intensity of agricultural land-use, and either decreased or increased with time after abandonment dependent on prior land-use. The predicted mean recovery rate of woody biomass over the first 20 years following abandonment matched that predicted by a general model for the Neotropics, but recovery was three-fold higher on sites abandoned following traditional agriculture than on sites recovering from intensive agriculture. Estimated total biomass recovered to just above half that of reference old growth forests within 71 years. The inclusion of the biomass of lianas and smaller tree stems did not modify the apparent rate of ecosystem biomass recovery, however the proportion of the total biomass stored in small stems was greater following intensive than traditional agriculture, which suggests that patterns of stand structural development are sensitive to land-use history. We conclude that effects of historic land use on soil nutrient concentrations and their changes through time are required for a more complete interpretation of variation in biomass recovery rates at local scales. These results also highlight the critical importance of contemporary agricultural intensification for carbon storage in tropical forests. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Inter-relationships among mosquito vectors, Plasmodium parasites, human ecology, and biotic and abiotic factors, drive malaria risk. Specifically, rural landscapes shaped by human activities have a great potential to increase the abundance of malaria vectors, putting many vulnerable people at risk. Understanding at which point the abundance of vectors increases in the landscape can help to design policies and interventions for effective and sustainable control. Using a dataset of adult female mosquitoes collected at 79 sites in malaria endemic areas in the Brazilian Amazon, this study aimed to (1) verify the association among forest cover percentage (PLAND), forest edge density (ED), and variation in mosquito diversity; and to (2) test the hypothesis of an association between landscape structure (i.e., PLAND and ED) and Nyssorhynchus darlingi (Root) dominance. Mosquito collections were performed employing human landing catch (HLC) (peridomestic habitat) and Shannon trap combined with HLC (forest fringe habitat). Nyssorhynchus darlingi abundance was used as the response variable in a generalized linear mixed model, and the Shannon diversity index (H') of the Culicidae community, PLAND, and the distance house-water drainage were used as predictors. Three ED categories were also used as random effects. A path analysis was used to understand comparative strengths of direct and indirect relationships among Amazon vegetation classes, Culicidae community, and Ny. darlingi abundance. Our results demonstrate that Ny. darlingi is negatively affected by H ' and PLAND of peridomestic habitat, and that increasing these variables (one-unit value at beta(0) = 768) leads to a decrease of 226 (P < 0.001) and 533 (P = 0.003) individuals, respectively. At the forest fringe, a similar result was found for H' (beta(1) = -218; P < 0.001) and PLAND (beta(1) = -337; P = 0.04). Anthropogenic changes in the Amazon vegetation classes decreased mosquito biodiversity, leading to increased Ny. darlingi abundance. Changes in landscape structure, specifically decreases in PLAND and increases in ED, led to Ny. darlingi becoming the dominant species, increasing malaria risk. Ecological mechanisms involving changes in landscape and mosquito species composition can help to understand changes in the epidemiology of malaria.

AB  - The formation and continued maintenance of beta diversity are essential factors contributing to the effective conservation of plant community biodiversity and sustainable development of ecosystem functions. While it is widely acknowledged that two different patterns, including turnover and nestedness, strongly influence plant community beta diversity, their relative importance in the unique dry and hot valleys of Southwest China is yet to be fully understood. For this study, we established a 100 km belt transect in the Nujiang dry and hot valley of Southwest China and conducted community investigations. The calculations of species and phylogenetic beta diversity composition patterns allowed us to explore the relative importance of environmental and dispersal limitations in terms of their contributions to beta diversity. The findings indicated that in the Nujiang dry and hot valley of Northwest Yunnan, species and phylogenetic beta diversity in the plant communities were mainly composed of the turnover component. The values of phylogenetic beta diversity and its turnover components were lower than those of species beta diversity. Both environmental and dispersal limitations played a role in partitioning beta diversity in the region, with environmental limitations being more dominant than dispersal limitations. The analysis of specific environmental factors revealed that climate factors, such as mean annual precipitation and Hargreaves reference evaporation, and soil factors, such as pH, were the primary drivers of species and phylogenetic beta diversity in the region. In addition, we observed that various limiting environmental factors related to the growth and development of different life forms existed within the dry and hot valley communities. The study highlighted the potential benefits of establishing conservation reserves featuring multiple dominant shrub species in the Nujiang dry and hot valley of Southwest China for the protection of the vegetation. The findings demonstrated that environmental factors, particularly hydrothermal conditions, played a significant role in constraining the maintenance of beta diversity in plant communities in the dry and hot valley region at a regional scale, given the geological history and environmental changes that have occurred over time.

AB  - Following the largest forest fire in Vietnam in 2002, various activities were undertaken to sustain the mangrove forest on peat soil remnants in the Mekong Delta region. These activities included promoting natural regeneration, afforestation, and rapid forest restoration measures, in addition to other protective measures such as rainwater retention to maintain moisture levels for fire prevention. However, two critical challenges emerged: allowing the forest to naturally regenerate would lead to annual forest fires but maintaining a constant water level through year-round water retention would harm biodiversity. The study was conducted in U Minh Thuong National Park to address forest regeneration. After a major forest fire in Vietnam, various measures were taken to promote forest regeneration, including afforestation, silvicultural solutions, and hydrological techniques such as rainwater storage to maintain humidity and prevent future fires. A hand drill was used to collect samples, and a total of 15 plots were set up to survey the growth of the forest at three peat thickness levels. At each of the three collection sites, samples of one kg were collected and labeled according to the site as UTM1, UTM2, and UTM3. The samples were then sent to the laboratory of the Southern Institute of Forestry Science for analysis. There was a relationship between the chemical indicators of peat and the evolution of the Melaleuca forest. Peat thickness and flooding regime significantly influenced the growth of the Melaleuca forest, while another identified relationship was between peat chemical indicators and forest growth. The chemical composition of peat water changed significantly due to the rainy and dry seasons, with nutrient content and pH affecting forest growth. Peat thickness and flooding regime were essential in regulating forest growth. These studies highlight the importance of considering multiple factors, such as peat thickness and chemical properties, when developing effective forest restoration strategies. By understanding the relationship between peat thickness, chemical properties, and forest growth, forest managers can develop targeted strategies to promote regeneration while minimizing negative impacts on biodiversity.

AB  - Climate change and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) are important drivers of forest demography. Here we apply previously derived growth and survival responses for 94 tree species, representing >90% of the contiguous US forest basal area, to project how changes in mean annual temperature, precipitation, and N and S deposition from 20 different future scenarios may affect forest composition to 2100. We find that under the low climate change scenario (RCP 4.5), reductions in aboveground tree biomass from higher temperatures are roughly offset by increases in aboveground tree biomass from reductions in N and S deposition. However, under the higher climate change scenario (RCP 8.5) the decreases from climate change overwhelm increases from reductions in N and S deposition. These broad trends underlie wide variation among species. We found averaged across temperature scenarios the relative abundance of 60 species were projected to decrease more than 5% and 20 species were projected to increase more than 5%; and reductions of N and S deposition led to a decrease for 13 species and an increase for 40 species. This suggests large shifts in the composition of US forests in the future. Negative climate effects were mostly from elevated temperature and were not offset by scenarios with wetter conditions. We found that by 2100 an estimated 1 billion trees under the RCP 4.5 scenario and 20 billion trees under the RCP 8.5 scenario may be pushed outside the temperature record upon which these relationships were derived. These results may not fully capture future changes in forest composition as several other factors were not included. Overall efforts to reduce atmospheric deposition of N and S will likely be insufficient to overcome climate change impacts on forest demography across much of the United States unless we adhere to the low climate change scenario.

AB  - Increased anthropogenic pressure including intensification of agricultural activities leads to long-term decline of natural biotopes, with planted forests often considered as promising compensatory response, although reduced biodiversity and ecosystem stability represent their common drawbacks. Here we present a complex investigation of the impact of a large Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea L.) colony on soil biogeochemistry and vegetation in a planted Scots pine forest representing a natural in situ experiment on an engineered ecosystem. After settling around 2006, the colony expanded for 15 years, leading to the intensive deposition of nutrients with feces, food remains and feather thereby considerably altering the local soil biogeochemistry. Thus, lower pH levels around 4.5, 10- and 2-fold higher concentrations of phosphorous and nitrogen, as well as 1.2-fold discrepancies in K, Li, Mn, Zn and Co., respectively, compared to the surrounding control forest area could be observed. Unaltered total organic carbon (C-org) suggests repressed vegetation, as also reflected in the vegetation indices obtained by remote sensing. Moreover, reduced soil microbial diversity with considerable alternations in the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteriota, Actinobacteriota, Verrucomicrobiota, Gemmatimonadota, Chujaibacter, Rhodanobacter, and Bacillus has been detected. The above alterations to the ecosystem also affected climate stress resilience of the trees indicated by their limited recovery from the major 2010 drought stress, in marked contrast to the surrounding forest (p = 3 center dot 10(-5)). The complex interplay between geographical, geochemical, microbiological and dendrological characteristics, as well as their manifestation in the vegetation indices is explicitly reflected in the Bayesian network model. Using the Bayesian inference approach, we have confirmed the predictability of biodiversity patterns and trees growth dynamics given the concentrations of keynote soil biogeochemical alternations with correlations R > 0.8 between observations and predictions, indicating the capability of risk assessment that could be further employed for an informed forest management.

AB  - BackgroundArid and semi-arid regions account for about 40% of the world's land surface area, and are the most sensitive areas to climate change, leading to a dramatic expansion of arid regions in recent decades. Ephemeral plants are crucial herbs in this area and are very sensitive to climate change, but it is still unclear which factors can determine the distribution of ephemeral plants and how the distribution of ephemeral plants responds to future climate change across the globe. AimsUnderstanding the impact of climate change on ephemeral plant distribution is crucial for sustainable biodiversity conservation. MethodsThis study explored the potential distribution of three types of ephemeral plants in arid and semi-arid regions (cold desert, hot desert, and deciduous forest) on a global scale using the MaxEnt software. We used species global occurrence data and 30 environmental factors in scientific collections. ResultsOur results showed that (1) the average value of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of each species was higher than 0.95, indicating that the MaxEnt model's simulation accuracy for each species was good; (2) distributions of cold desert and deciduous forest species were mainly determined by soil pH and annual mean temperature; the key factor that determines the distribution of hot desert species was precipitation of the driest month; and (3) the potential distribution of ephemeral plants in the cold desert was increased under one-third of climate scenarios; in the hot desert, the potential suitable distribution for Anastatica hierochuntica was decreased in more than half of the climate scenarios, but Trigonella arabica was increased in more than half of the climate scenarios. In deciduous forests, the ephemeral plant Crocus alatavicus decreased in nearly nine-tenths of climate scenarios, and Gagea filiformis was increased in 75% of climate scenarios. ConclusionsThe potential suitable distributions of ephemeral plants in the different ecosystems were closely related to their specific adaptation strategies. These results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the potential distribution pattern of some ephemeral plants in arid and semi-arid ecosystems.

AB  - Grasslands are among the most threatened and least protected terrestrial biome. Grassland forbs: (1) account for most of the floral diversity; (2) are not well studied because they have been overshadowed by grass-centered research; and (3) have been a major source for biodiversity loss. The Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie (PNB) of North America is one of the most endangered grasslands on earth. Knowledge of vegetation community dynamics in the PNB is based primarily on bunchgrasses. There is a paucity of information related to the PNB's diverse native perennial forbs (hereafter "forbs"). Consequently, PNB forb community patterns and dynamics are largely unknown. We describe forb community structure and its relationship to environmental factors and phenology. We sampled 29 plots in the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range, northeastern Oregon, at three different times during 2016 (April; May; July). Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) indicated that the dominant gradient in forb composition was related (R-2 = 0.66) to slope and soil P and K, contrasting flat, poorly drained soils (scabflats) at one end with steep, well-drained soils at the other end. The secondary gradient (R-2 = 0.16) contrasted deeper, finer textured soils at one end with shallow, rocky soils at the other. Forb richness decreased by similar to 40% from April to July. NMS and Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) showed that most forbs had affinities toward spring. Ubiquitous forbs (e.g., Triteleia grandiflora, Camassia quamash) were sparse to absent by July. Contradictory to general descriptions of the PNB, forb cover and richness in drought-prone sites were comparable to mesic sites when spring data were considered. Our findings suggest that PNB grasslands contain diverse forb communities that are structured primarily by water drainage and soil depth. Conventional sampling concomitant with peak grass biomass is insufficient to characterize PNB forb communities, particularly for scabflats and the most drought-prone soils.

AB  - 1. Tropical forests are the most productive terrestrial ecosystems, fixing over 40 Pg of carbon from the atmosphere each year. A substantial portion of this carbon is allocated below-ground to roots and root-associated micro-organisms. However, there have been very few empirical studies on the dynamics of this below ground transfer, especially in tropical forests where carbon allocation processes are influenced by high plant species diversity.
   2. We used a whole-stand girdling experiment to halt the below-ground transfer of recent photosynthates in a lowland tropical forest in Borneo. By girdling 209 large trees in a 0.48 ha plot, we determined: (a) the contribution of recent photosynthate to root-rhizosphere respiration and; (b) the relationships among the disruption of this below-ground carbon supply, tree species composition and mortality.
   3. Mortality of the 209 trees was 62% after 370 days, with large variation among species and particularly high mortality within the Dipterocarpaceae (99%) and Fagaceae (100%) families. We also observed a higher risk of mortality following girdling for species with lower wood density.
   4. Soil CO2 emissions declined markedly (36 +/- 5%) over similar to 50 days following girdling in three of six monitored subplots. In the other three subplots there was either a marginal decline or no response of soil CO2 emissions to girdling. The decrease in soil CO2 efflux was larger in subplots with dominance of Dipterocarpaceae.
   5. Synthesis. Our results indicate high spatial variation in the coupling of below-ground carbon allocation and root-rhizosphere respiration in this tropical forest, with a closer coupling in forest dominated by Dipterocarpaceae. Our findings highlight the implications of tree species composition of tropical forests in affecting the dynamics of below-ground carbon transfer and its release to the atmosphere.

AB  - Background and Aims Gypsum drylands are widespread worldwide. In these arid ecosystems, the ability of different species to access different water sources during drought is a key determining factor of the composition of plant communities. Gypsum crystallization water could be a relevant source of water for shallow-rooted plants, but the segregation in the use of this source of water among plants remains unexplored. We analysed the principal water sources used by 20 species living in a gypsum hilltop, the effect of rooting depth and gypsum affinity, and the interaction of the plants with the soil beneath them.
   Methods We characterized the water stable isotope composition, delta H-2 and delta O-18, of plant xylem water and related it to the free and gypsum crystallization water extracted from different depths throughout the soil profile and the groundwater, in both spring and summer. Bayesian isotope mixing models were used to estimate the contribution of water sources to plant xylem sap.
   Key Results In spring, all species used free water from the top soil as the main source. In summer, there was segregation in water sources used by different species depending on their rooting depth, but not on their gypsum affinity. Gypsum crystallization water was the main source for most shallow-rooted species, whereas free water from 50 to 100 cm depth was the main source for deep-rooted species. We detected plant-soil interactions in spring, and indirect evidence of possible hydraulic lift by deep-rooted species in summer.
   Conclusions Plants coexisting in gypsum communities segregate their hydrological niches according to their rooting depth. Crystallization water of gypsum represents an unaccounted for, vital source for most of the shallow-rooted species growing on gypsum drylands. Thus, crystallization water helps shallow-rooted species to endure arid conditions, which eventually accounts for the maintenance of high biodiversity in these specialized ecosystems.

AB  - With rising temperatures, developing countries are exposed to the horrors of climate change more than ever. The poor infrastructure and low adaptation capabilities of these nations are the prime concern of current studies. Pakistan is vulnerable to climate-induced hazards including floods, droughts, water shortages, shifts in weather patterns, loss of biodiversity, melting of glaciers, and more in the coming years. For marginal societies dependent on natural resources, adaptation becomes a challenge and the utmost priority. Within the above context, this study was designed to fill the existing research gap concerning public knowledge of climate vulnerabilities and respective adaptation strategies in the northern Hindukush-Himalayan region of Pakistan. Using the stratified sampling technique, 25 union councils (wards) were selected from the nine tehsils (sub-districts) of the study area. Using the quantitative method approach, structured questionnaires were employed to collect data from 396 respondents. The study reveals varying public perceptions about different factors contributing to the causes and impacts of climate change and the sources of information in the three zones of the study area. The primary causes of climate change are deforestation, industrial waste, anthropogenic impurities, natural causes, and the burning of fossil fuels exacerbated by increased population. Changes in temperature, erratic rainfalls, floods, droughts, receding glaciers, and extreme weather events are some of the impacts observed over the past decades. While limiting the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels combined with government-assisted rehabilitation of forests can help combat climate change, the lack of proper education and economic, social, and governance barriers are hindering the local adaptation strategies. In addition, reduce environmental pollution (air, water, soil, etc.) and plantation polluted areas with suitable plants, are the two main actions in combating climate change. This study recommends policy interventions to enhance local adaptation efforts through building capacity, equipping local environmental institutions, discouraging deforestation, and ensuring sustainable use of natural resources.

AB  - Second-growth forests (SGF) are critical components for limiting biodiversity loss and climate change mitigation. However, these forests were established after anthropic disturbances such as land use for planting, and in highly human-modified landscapes. These interventions can decrease the ability of biological communities to recover naturally, and it is necessary to understand how multiple drivers, from local scale to landscape scale influence the diversity and carbon stock of these forests in natural regeneration. For this, we used data from 37 SGF growing on areas previously used for eucalyptus plantations in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, after the last cut cycle. For each SGF, the forest tree species diversity was calculated based on the Hills number, and we also calculated the aboveground carbon stock. Then, we evaluated the influence of multiple environmental factors on these indexes: soil properties, past-management intensity, patch configuration, and landscape composition. Little influence of soil properties was found, only soil fertility negatively influenced above-ground carbon stock. However, pastmanagement intensity negatively influenced tree species diversity and carbon stock. The isolation of other forests and tree species propagules source distance (>500 ha) also negatively influenced the diversity of species. This is probably due to the favoring of tree pioneer species in highly human-modified landscapes because they are more tolerant of environmental changes, less dependent on animal dispersal, and have low carbon stock capacity. Thus, areas with higher past-management intensity and more isolated areas are less effective for passive restoration and may require intervention to recover tree diversity and carbon stock in the Atlantic Forest. The approach, which had not yet been applied in the Atlantic Forest, brought similar results to that found in other forests, and serves as a theoretical basis for choosing priority areas for passive restoration in the biome.

AB  - It is expected that European Boreal and Temperate forests will be greatly affected by climate change, causing natural disturbances to increase in frequency and severity. To detangle how, through forest management, we can make forests less vulnerable to the impact of natural disturbances, we need to include the risks of such disturbances in our decision-making tools. The present review investigates: i) how the most important forestry-related natural disturbances are linked to climate change, and ii) different modelling approaches that assess the risks of natural disturbances and their applicability for large-scale forest management planning. Global warming will decrease frozen soil periods, which increases root rot, snow, ice and wind damage, cascading into an increment of bark beetle damage. Central Europe will experience a decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature, which lowers tree defenses against bark beetles and increases root rot infestations. Ice and wet snow damages are expected to increase in Northern Boreal forests, and to reduce in Temperate and Southern Boreal forests. However, lack of snow cover may increase cases of frost-damaged seedlings. The increased temperatures and drought periods, together with a fuel increment from other disturbances, likely enhance wildfire risk, especially for Temperate forests. For the review of European modelling approaches, thirty-nine disturbance models were assessed and categorized according to their required input variables and to the models' outputs. Probability models are usually common for all disturbance model approaches, however, models that predict disturbance effects seem to be scarce.

AB  - Acid rain, as one of the global environmental issues, alters the biogeochemistry of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the responses of soil greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions to acid rain remain unclear, thus creating large uncertainties in the prediction of global climate change. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis based on existing 42 studies to assess the influences of acid rain on soil GHGs emissions. Results showed that acid rain significantly decreased soil CO2 emission by 11.7%, but marginally increased soil N2O emission by 11.7%. In addition, acid rain significantly decreased soil pH, dissolved organic carbon (C), microbial biomass C, nitrate nitrogen (N), hydrolysable N and total phosphorus, while increased soil organic C, ammonium N and C/N ratio. Moreover, acid rain significantly decreased the activity of soil urease, sucrase and invertase. Acid rain significantly decreased soil bacterial and gram-negative bacterial biomass, while increased the microbial biomass of gram-positive bacteria, fungi and actinomycete, and the ratios of fungi/bacteria and gram-positive/gramnegative bacteria. Furthermore, acid rain significantly decreased the aboveground biomass and fine root biomass of vegetation. The effect size of soil CO2 emission had significantly positive relationships with that of soil pH, microbial biomass C, urease activity, and fine root biomass, while it negatively related with that of soil organic C and C/N ratio. These findings suggest that acid rain reduces soil CO2 emission and promotes soil organic C accumulation.

AB  - The Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) has a long history of research on tropical forestry, ecology, and conservation, dating as far back as the early 19th Century. Scientific surveys conducted by early explorers of Puerto Rico, followed by United States institutions contributed early understanding of biogeography, species endemism, and tropical soil characteristics. Research in the second half of the 1900s established the LEF as an exemplar of forest management and restoration research in the tropics. Research conducted as part of a radiation experiment funded by the Atomic Energy Commission in the 1960s on forest metabolism established the field of ecosystem ecology in the tropics. Subsequent research has built on these early advances to develop new theories on ecosystem response to disturbance regimes and the role of the biota in ecosystem resilience. Recent and current research in the LEF has advanced understanding of resilience to hurricane disturbances, human land use, gamma irradiation, landslides, drought, and warming, showing that even following the most severe disturbances (e.g., landslides, agriculture) forests reestablish within 60 years. Work in the LEF has reversed the paradigm that tropical ecosystems are fragile, but instead exhibit remarkable resilience to many forms of disturbance present at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Current research is already advancing understanding of how climate change and attendant effects on the disturbance regime might affect the composition, structure, and function of tropical forest ecosystems.

AB  - Non-native earthworms can cause abrupt changes in forest ecosystems by altering soil properties and depleting or redistributing soil carbon (C) stocks. The forests of Northern Maine are often perceived as having winters that are too harsh to support earthworm populations and that earthworms are restricted to more southerly regions. In this study, we report the discovery of European earthworms at two research sites in Northern Maine. At one site, earthworms were only found across a portion of the forest, and the median organic (O) horizon C stock in the area with earthworms was 34% less than that of areas without earthworms. At a second site, earthworms were found across the entire 60-ha forest and the median O horizon C stock was 39% less than that of a similar forest without earthworms. Consistent with reports from other regions, areas with earthworms had no or minimal eluvial (E) horizons, while earthworm-free locations always had E horizons. Earthworm presence was always associated with a topsoil (A) horizon, reflecting mechanical mixing and organic matter processing by earthworms. This is one of the first reports of non-native earthworm presence in Northern Maine forests and monitoring changes in soil C will be important for determining rates of C sequestration in these forests. Warmer winter temperatures, particularly winter minimums, and greater annual precipitation will likely increase the success of new earthworm introductions across Northern Maine forests. Management actions that limit the transport of earthworms into earthworm-free areas should be carefully evaluated to minimize the potential for new introductions.

AB  - Water scarcity in the southeastern United States has increased in recent decades due to population growth, land use intensification and climate variability. Precipitation is relatively abundant, but declines in streamflow suggest a need to better manage water yield. Restoration of low-density, frequent-fire longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) woodlands, which once dominated the southeastern Coastal Plain, represents a possible strategy to increase water yield and mitigate water scarcity. The Flint River Basin has seen recent conflicts over water appropriations and lies within the historic range of longleaf pine. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to evaluate the potential effect of longleaf pine restoration on streamflow in the Ichawaynochaway Creek, a major tributary of the Flint River. Parameters governing plant water use, for example, leaf area and leaf physiology, were adjusted to create a longleaf pine land cover. We simulated the conversion of similar to 95,000 ha of existing forest to longleaf pine, an increase from 3% to 35% of landcover in the basin. Modelled evapotranspiration was lower for longleaf pine compared with other forest types in the region, and conversion to longleaf pine increased annual water yield by 17.9 +/- 1.6 mm, or 5.2%. Proportional changes in monthly streamflow were up to 74% higher during low flow periods, when in-stream habitat is most vulnerable. Restoration of longleaf pine could be a promising way to mitigate water scarcity in the southeastern United States and adding flow during extreme droughts may prove vitally important for conserving imperilled aquatic organisms.

AB  - Logging and forest conversion are occurring at alarming rates in tropical forests. These disturbances alter soil microbial community structure and functions. While direct links between changes in soil properties, such as pH and microbial community structure are well established, the indirect effects of logging and forest conversion on soil microbial community structure and functions are poorly understood. We used a space-for-time substitution to investigate the changes in soil microbial diversity and functions across a forest recovery gradient in the tropical montane forests of northern Borneo. We used surface (top 5 cm) soil to assess soil physicochemical and microbial (next-generation DNA sequencing) properties, and standardized litterbags (Tea Bag Index) to assess litter decomposition and stabilization. Our results show that bacterial and fungal diversity increases with recovery time and reaches pre-disturbance levels between 60- and 80-years post-disturbance. Litter decomposition rate constants increased linearly with increasing bacterial and fungal diversity. Litter stabilization also increased linearly with fungal diversity, but was highest at intermediate levels of bacterial diversity. Our results provide insights on the effects of forest logging and conversion on soils and highlight the tight coupling between soil microbial diversity and soil functions in tropical montane forests.

AB  - The fungal biodiversity associated with a stable plant community appears to vary from year to year. To analyse the annual behaviour in the formation of fruiting bodies, a statistical study of the data obtained for 4 years (2009-2012) in an apparently undisturbed Mediterranean ecosystem dominated by the holm oak (Quercus ilex L. subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.), located in the Midwest of the Iberian Peninsula, was carried out. These data were related to the main meteorological variables. The 150 species collected showed a significant annual, monthly, and weekly difference in their fruiting during the collection period. All this implies a variation in the annual fungal fruiting which can modify the moment of when maximum peaks of fruiting appear, their duration, and the number of species that compose them. In addition, the results make it possible to establish an annual behaviour pattern, with sporocarp formation throughout the year and four fruiting groups (two of them in the dry season). They also allow for inferring a possible response to climate change, with a delay in the fruiting of the autumn-winter group and earlier fruit bearing in the winter-spring group.

AB  - Natural and planted grasslands play a very important role in agriculture as source of various ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and are responsible for a large fraction of agricultural water use in rainfed and irrigated fields. It is, therefore, relevant to precisely know their water use and vegetation requirements with consideration of relevant climate, from extremely cold, dry, with long winter seasons, to tropical humid and hot climates, thus with a large variability of vegetation. Semi-natural grasslands are basically used for grazing and mainly refer to highland pastures and meadows, steppes, savannas, pampas, and mixed forest systems. The FAO method to compute crop (vegetation) evapotranspiration (ETc) through the product of a crop coefficient (K-c) by the reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is adopted. The selected papers were those where actual ETc (ETc act) was derived from field observations and ETo was computed with the FAO56 definition, or with another method that could be referred to the former. Field derived ETc act methods included soil water balance, Bowen ratio and eddy covariance measurements, as well as remote sensing vegetation indices or surface energy balance models, thus reviewed K-c act (ETc act/ETo) values were obtained from field data. These K-c act refer to initial, mid-season and end season (K-c act ini, K-c act mid, K-c act end) when reported values were daily or monthly; otherwise, only average values (K-c act avg) were collected. For cases relative to cold or freezing winters, data refer to the warm season only. For grasses cut for hay, K-c act ini, K-c act mid, and K-c act end refer to a cut cycle. K-c act values rarely exceeded 1.25, thus indicating that field measurements reported did respect the available energy for evaporation. Overall, K-c act (mid) for semi-natural grasslands in cold climates were lower than those in hot climates except when available water was high, with K-c act mid for meadows and mountain pastures generally high. Steppes have K-c act mid values lower than savannas. Grasses commonly planted for hay and for landscape generally showed high K-c act mid values, while a larger variability was observed with grasses for grazing. The collected K-c act values were used to define standard K-c values for all grassland and grasses. Nevertheless, the tabulated K-c act are indicative values of K-c to be used for actual water management purposes and/or irrigation scheduling of planted grasslands. It is expected that a better knowledge of the standard and/or indicative K-c values for a wide variety of grasslands and grasses will support better management aimed to improve grass productivity and ecosystem services, including biodiversity and carbon sequestration.

AB  - Forest gaps, which are formed by small-scale disturbances that often occur in forest communities, are the most dominant form of disturbance in many types of forests around the world and play an essential role in the dynamics of forest regeneration, plant diversity conservation, nutrient cycling, and forest succession. Forest gaps are one of the vital directions in forest research. Dynamic disturbance and vegetation regeneration are important elements of forest gap research. The research on forest gaps has a history spanning over 70 years, but there is a lack of a systematic overview of the process. Therefore, this review outlines the spatial changes in the whole process of forest gap development by systematically analyzing the occurrence, basic characteristics, micro-environmental changes, and the effects of forest gap disturbance processes on understory animals, plants, soil microorganisms, and forest regeneration and succession. The results contribute to a better understanding of forest gaps and their impacts on forest regeneration and management. Based on this, we remapped the forest gap process during forest succession. We suggest directions and recommendations for improvements in response to the dilemmas and challenges facing the future of forest gaps.

AB  - The genus Phytophthora represents a group of plant pathogens with broad global distribution. The majority of them cause the collar and root-rot of diverse plant species. Little is known about Phytophthora communities in forest ecosystems, especially in the Neotropical forests where natural enemies could maintain the huge plant diversity via negative density dependence. We characterized the diversity of soil-borne Phytophthora communities in the North French Guiana rainforest and investigated how they are structured by host identity and environmental factors. In this little-explored habitat, 250 soil cores were sampled from 10 plots hosting 10 different plant families across three forest environments (Terra Firme, Seasonally Flooded and White Sand). Phytophthora diversity was studied using a baiting approach and metabarcoding (High-Throughput Sequencing) on environmental DNA extracted from both soil samples and baiting-leaves. These three approaches revealed very similar communities, characterized by an unexpected low diversity of Phytophthora species, with the dominance of two cryptic species close to Phytophthora heveae. As expected, the Phytophthora community composition of the French Guiana rainforest was significantly impacted by the host plant family and environment. However, these plant pathogen communities are very small and are dominated by generalist species, questioning their potential roles as drivers of plant diversity in these Amazonian forests.

AB  - Fire has, does, and will shape forest structure, composition, and biodiversity. In this book, we introduce the driving forces, historical patterns, and future management challenges of fire in forested ecoregions across the continental USA. Climate warming and decades of fire suppression or exclusion have altered historical fire regimes and threaten diversity of fire-adapted forest vegetation into the future. Historical fire regimes ranged from frequent, low-severity fires in some ecosystems to infrequent, high-severity fires in others. They were driven by interactions among climate, drought cycles, topography and soils, fuel type and accumulation, and ignition frequencies by lightning; and increasingly by humans as Native American populations expanded in many ecoregions. Fires burned across large landscapes in ecosystems where fuels were continuous, such as pine-savanna ecosystems of the Southeastern Coastal Plain or ponderosa pine forests of the Southwest. Today, decades of fire exclusion have led to divergent outcomes: succession toward forests less apt to burn (mesophication), or more frequent or higher-severity wildfires. Management of fire toward future forests will require careful definition of desired future and reference conditions, establishing priorities, and working across agency boundaries to implement prescriptions.

AB  - East African riparian corridors are biodiversity hot spots that occur in catchments degrading under deforestation and overgrazing. Quadrats and belt transects were employed to investigate plant succession along the River Gilgil, in the Kenyan Rift Valley. The study found that most species (total 365) were broadly distributed across the tropics, but Rift Valley endemics were 12.5%, and 4%-18% were exotic. Plant composition varied with altitude, lithology, soils and rainfall. Agglomerative (Jaccard) hierarchical clustering and Non-metric Dimensional Scaling identified two and three vegetation groups, for quadrats and transects, respectively, correlated with lithology and soils. Indicator species analysis highlighted that the upstream portion of the catchment was characterised by forest taxa with few exotics. The downstream included woodland species adapted to mesic/xeric conditions and to overgrazing. Longitudinal change in species composition (beta diversity) between sites was assessed by taking into consideration the contribution of 'spatial species turnover' and 'nestedness', resulting from species replacement and species loss, respectively. The beta diversity of the riparian corridor vegetation was 0.40 and spatial turnover accounted for 80%-85% of this, while the rest was attributed to the nestedness component. Riverine and native trees increased downstream but with low regeneration. Afromontane vegetation extended its distribution towards lower altitudes.

AB  - Climate change is projected to significantly affect the vulnerability of forests across the western United States to wildfires, insects, disease, and droughts. Here, we provide recent mortality estimates for large trees for 53 species across 48 ecological sections using an analysis of 23,215 Forest Inventory plots and a Random Forest classification model. Models were also used to predict mortality in future FIA inventories under the RCP 4.5 emissions scenario. Model performance indicated species identity as the most important predictor of mortality under both current and future scenarios, with contributions from climate and soil variables. Our results show relatively high levels of recent mortality in the Middle and Southern Rocky Mountains driven by high mortality in Populus tremuloides, Pinus contorta, Pinus albicaulis, and Abies lasiocarpa. Low levels of mortality were observed in several species, with <1% annual mortality observed throughout all other sections. Future mortality was predicted to increase significantly for most species and correlated well with recent mortality at the species level, but not at the plot level. These results suggest that future attempts to model or predict widespread forest mortality would benefit from more research on vulnerable species and that significant mortality events in some species may not be important for dynamics across all systems.

TI  - Registration of 'ARTPEA-204B', an early-maturing cowpea cultivar for the southern agro-ecology of Nigeria, with high fodder, high grain yield and reduced need for insecticidal spray
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT REGISTRATIONS
LA  - English
AB  - Cowpea [Vigna ungiculata (L.) Walp] production is affected by numerous constraints such as insect pests, diseases (fungal, viral, and bacterial), poor soil fertility, metal toxicity, drought, and excessive rainfall. The high cost of input, especially pesticides, also contributes to the reduction of cowpea yield potential in sub-Saharan Africa. 'ARTPEA-204B' (Reg. no. CV-351, PI 702792; National code NGVU-22-38), also known as Modupe, was developed through a cross between 'Ife Brown' and a wild cowpea landrace and release by the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training, Obafemi Awolowo University, Moor Plantation, Ibadan, Nigeria, in 2022. It was bred for early maturing, high grain and fodder yield, and reduced insecticidal spray for the southern agro-ecologies of Nigeria. ARTPEA-204B along with Ife Brown and other cowpea lines were evaluated under farmer's management conditions in an on-farm trial conducted in 30 communities in 15 local government areas of Ondo, Ekiti, Osun, and Oyo States in 2021 under farmers' condition. ARTPEA-204B is early maturing (69-72 days), high-yielding fodder (4500 kg/ha) and grain (1.29 t/ha), photoperiod insensitive, reduce spray, and adaptable to all agro-ecologies in southern Nigeria.
   ARTPEA-204B cowpea is very early in maturity.ARTPEA-204B cowpea is resistant to anthracnose, bacterial blight, and tolerant to brown blotch.ARTPEA-204B cowpea is broadly adaptable across southern agro-ecologies of Nigeria.

AB  - A review was conducted to highlight the most important factors contributing to increased mortality and decreased growth in eucalypt plantations during re-establishment (0-12 months). Citations were ranked in terms of credibility, with the importance ratings (derived from the literature sources) applied to the different factors affecting survival and growth during eucalypt re-establishment. Of the various factors impacting early eucalypt mortality, water stress and planting stock quality were considered highly important. Other factors that negatively influence survival and early growth, albeit to a lesser degree than water stress and planting stock quality were the manner and quality of site preparation (soil and slash); planting practices (planting depth included); timing of planting (during dry, hot periods); various post-planting operations (incorrect fertiliser placement or herbicide drift) and insect pests and diseases. In South African forestry, soil water availability is a major contributor of re-establishment success and, as a water scarce country, research indicates the negative impacts this can have on survival and growth. Plant stock quality was also considered important, especially in terms of matching planting stock size (as influenced by age in container, species, season raised, etc.) to container type/size, as the planting of over- or under-prime planting stock will result in higher mortality. These factors cannot be considered in isolation due to the complex interactions that exist among them and determining the primary causes of mortality can be elusive, especially as their impacts tend to be additive by nature. Despite all the research implemented under controlled and field conditions, high mortality (and subsequently below optimal final yield) is still problematic. Most commercial forestry companies target a survival of at least 90% three months after planting, but it is not clear where this threshold level originates and it may be purely anecdotal. This raises key questions pertaining to the economic implications of various mitigation practices, including blanking, replanting and planting at higher densities that can ensure optimum stocking at rotation-end. The factors need to be looked at in greater detail to quantify the relative importance of each. The degree of interrelatedness among the factors should also be further researched.

AB  - How did early Anatomically Modern Human (Homo sapiens sapiens) appear on earth and then spread rapidly across the globe to the present day? There are two main stages of Homo sapiens' evolution: (1) the archaic Homo sapiens lived since their initial appearance up to 150,000 years ago, and (2) anatomically modern Homo sapiens from 150,000 years ago to the present. The multiregional model argues there was a gradual and continuous evolutionary process from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens in every region of Africa and Eurasia. In contrast the "Out of Africa"evolutionary model, known as the "replacement" theory argued that the genetic roots of Homo sapiens were around 150,000 to 100,000 years ago originated from one place in Africa, and spread out in different directions, flourished, and replaced local archaic populations. This paper will discuss the presence of early anatomically modern human remains in Southeast Asia including Indonesia from around the second half of the Upper Pleistocene including Wajak man, Lida Ajer and Punung remains, also Flores hominin.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - In order to understand the conduct of new paradigms aimed at ecological restoration, the objective of this work was to review the literature on the application of ecological restoration in protected areas of the Atlantic Forest biome, in order to contribute to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). With the use of indexers, focused keywords, and criteria focused on the theme, 58 scientific articles were selected, analyzed through a systematic review and compared with each other in the use of their strategies. The results showed a preference for active restoration with variations in species diversity, and passive restoration. Fertilization, control of competing plants, fighting ants and soil preparation are the most mentioned silvicultural practices. In the analysis of the proposed monitoring, diversity, information intrinsic to the species and the landscape, phytosociology and crown metrics, expressed the most recommended indicators for evaluating the restorative process, and suggest 74 species for use in the projects. In addition, it is necessary to encourage scientific productions on the subject to also include the Midwest and Northeast regions, fauna surveys, as well as a detailed description of the implementation of the ecological restoration project.

AB  - This report presents information on all aspects of the biology, ecology and invasion behaviour of Rhododendron ponticum L., particularly R. ponticum subsp. baeticum (Boiss. & Reut.) Hand.-Mazz. The main topics presented are: taxonomy, distribution, history of introduction and spread, ecology, biology, impacts, and management. The subspecies baeticum is native to the Iberian Peninsula, where it is close to extinction. This shade-tolerant evergreen shrub has been broadly introduced throughout Europe since the 18(th) century, mainly for ornamental purposes. The invasive taxon likely results from artificial introgressive hybridization with the Appalachian species R. catawbiense Minchx. It is now naturalized in many countries across western Europe and has become a serious invader in the British Isles. In continental Europe, it mostly invades forest ecosystems of the Atlantic domain, especially on acidic, nutrient-poor but moist soils. R. ponticum subsp. baeticum has perfectly adapted to the humid temperate climate of these regions. As a shade-tolerant species, it can spread out its dense canopy below tree canopies, thereby shading out most herb species and tree seedlings and saplings. Its thick litter likely impacts soil chemical and biological features and hence alters ecosystem processes. Though it produces thousands of seeds, the species mostly propagates vegetatively via layering and forms extended clonal thickets. Long-distance dispersal occurs via seeds, but those can only germinate on moss mats, decaying wood and bare soil and seedlings are very vulnerable to drought. The shrub is also known to be a reservoir for phytopathogenic oomycetes of the genus Phytophthora, including P. ramorum and P. kernoviae. R. ponticum subsp. baeticum invasion is an emerging threat to natural habitats and their associated fauna and flora in western continental Europe. Control is still challenging since management operations are not only expensive and time-consuming but also poorly effective due to vigorous resprouting from stumps after cutting and herbicide resistance.

AB  - Crops and ecosystems constantly change, and risks are derived from heavy rains, hurricanes, droughts, human activities, climate change, etc. This has caused additional damages with economic and social impacts. Natural phenomena have caused the loss of crop areas, which endangers food security, destruction of the habitat of species of flora and fauna, and flooding of populations, among others. To help in the solution, it is necessary to develop strategies that maximize agricultural production as well as reduce land wear, environmental impact, and contamination of water resources. The generation of crop and land-use maps is advantageous for identifying suitable crop areas and collecting precise information about the produce. In this work, a strategy is proposed to identify and map sorghum and corn crops as well as land use and land cover. Our approach uses Sentinel-2 satellite images, spectral indices for the phenological detection of vegetation and water bodies, and automatic learning methods: support vector machine, random forest, and classification and regression trees. The study area is a tropical agricultural area with water bodies located in southeastern Mexico. The study was carried out from 2017 to 2019, and considering the climate and growing seasons of the site, two seasons were created for each year. Land use was identified as: water bodies, land in recovery, urban areas, sandy areas, and tropical rainforest. The results in overall accuracy were: 0.99% for the support vector machine, 0.95% for the random forest, and 0.92% for classification and regression trees. The kappa index was: 0.99% for the support vector machine, 0.97% for the random forest, and 0.94% for classification and regression trees. The support vector machine obtained the lowest percentage of false positives and margin of error. It also acquired better results in the classification of soil types and identification of crops.

AB  - Clay-illuvial soils with argic horizon and developed from loess or other silty deposits constitute high-quality arable land owing to favourable physical and chemical properties. There are thus numerous reports on such soils, considering their structure, compaction, erosion, water and air properties. However, there is still a lack of quantitative studies on structure and physical properties on analogous soils under forests. The aim of this research was therefore a comprehensive description of the physical state, including structure, water and air properties, of a forest Retisol developed from loess. Morphographic, morphological and morphometric parameters of structure, selected physicochemical and water and air properties and also relationships among the obtained parameters were analysed for genetic horizons O, Ah, AE, E, Bt/E, Bt, BtC and C. The field survey and soil structure images indicated that the studied forest soil had an undisturbed sequence of genetic horizons. The soil structure was shaped by soil flora and fauna causing bioturbation. Qualitative and quantitative structure analysis revealed that the O horizon had a loose arrangement, the Ah horizon had an aggregate crumb structure, the AE horizon had zones of an aggregate crumb structure and non-aggregate structure (fissured or with channels), while the remaining mineral horizons showed essentially a non-aggregate structure with varying proportions and sizes of planes and biogenic pores (i.e. cracked or fissured structure and structure with channels, respectively). The morphometric and physicochemical parameters facilitated a detailed analysis of the Retisol's physical state. The Retisol's structure type and degree of aggregate development directly influenced its hydraulic conductivity and water retention capacity. Therefore, under simulated precipitation, the soil water content and effective saturation varied mainly in the topsoil (O-E horizons) and virtually no changes were observed in the subsoil (Bt-C horizons). The research resulted in a comprehensive analysis of the physicochemical and morphometric parameters, their relationships, and structure images that were previously unavailable in other studies, covering the physical state of the entire pedon of a forest Retisol. The results obtained may serve, for example, as a reference (control) for analogous soils located in non-forest ecosystems and become an element in space-for-time substitution scenarios aimed at assessing the intensity of anthropogenic transformation.

AB  - A key aspect of global forest management, woodland use intensity (WUI) greatly affects the composition and diversity of soil microbial communities, thereby affecting multiple ecosystem functions and services. However, the effects of WUI on soil microbial community composition and enzymatic activities remains unclear. The effects of anthropomor-phic alterations to a natural monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest in terms of the composition and diversity of soil fungal and bacterial communities, was investigated at a site in Yunnan Province, Southwest China. Soil microbial com-munities were assessed under four levels of disturbance with increasing levels of WUI: (i) none, undisturbed forest (control), (ii) light, naturally-regenerated Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gordon forest, (iii) intermediate, shrub and grassland communities formed through grazing, and (iv) severe, continuously managed coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plantations. With increasing WUI, the diversity of soil fungal and bacterial communities increased, while similarities in community composition decreased for fungi but increased for bacteria. Among fungal functional guilds, ectomycorrhizal fungi de-creased significantly with increasing WUI, whereas saprotrophic fungi (undefined, wood, and soil saprotrophs) in-creased significantly. The species richness of woody plants remarkably affected fungal functional guilds. Ectomycorrhizal fungi interacted in a synergistic manner with the fungal network structure. Significantly affecting microorganismal network structure, WUI increases led to more homogeneous networks with less integration within modules within the microbial community. The WUI strongly altered hub identity and module composition in the mi-crobial community. According to structural equation models, WUI had direct positive effects on soil fungal community composition via its effects on plant species richness. The diversity of bacterial and fungal communities and composition of bacterial communities were jointly regulated by the indirect effects of plant species richness and soil nutrients (including enzyme activity). Deterministic processes largely determined the composition of soil fungal and bacterial communities. This study highlights the importance of maintaining the diversity of soil fungal and bacterial communities despite changes in woodland use to sustain ecosystem functions. These results can be used to develop management practices in subtropical forests and help sustain plant and soil microbial diversity at levels sufficient to maintain long-term ecosystem function and services.

AB  - Tree growth regulates forest productivity and carbon sequestration. Although there has been evidence showing positive effects of neighborhood diversity on tree growth, few have experimentally demonstrated how tree growth may respond to neighborhood diversity in natural forests under altered water availability, which is anticipated to occur more frequently with ongoing global climate change. We examined three-year individual tree basal area growth under the water alteration treatments of reduced (-25% throughfall during the growing season), ambient and added (+25% throughfall during the growing season) rainfall in the broadleaf stands, conifer stands and their mixtures of a young natural boreal forest. We quantified neighborhood drought tolerance dissimilarity, phylogeny dissimilarity and neighborhood crowding based on individual tree sizes and the distance between them. We found that the tree growth on average did not change significantly with water alteration but decreased with neighborhood crowding, with the negative crowding effect being more pronounced in water reduction treatment than in ambient and water addition treatments. Higher neighborhood dissimilarity of drought tolerance and phylogeny promoted tree growth consistently across all water conditions. Moreover, the positive effects of neighborhood dissimilarity of drought tolerance and phylogeny became more pronounced with increasing neighborhood crowding. Our results suggest that promoting species mixtures in boreal forests may sustain higher boreal forest productivity under changing water availability.

AB  - Species interactions in mixed plantations can influence tree growth, resources capture and soil fertility of the stands. A combined approach of tree-ring analyses and carbon stable isotope was used to check tree growth and water use efficiency of two species, Populus alba L. and Juglans regia L., intercropped with each other and with N-fixing or competitive production species. Furthermore, soil analyses were performed to understand how the different intercropping systems can influence soil characteristics, in particular soil carbon stock. Dendrochronological data showed that during the first years, the growth of principal species was favored by intercropping. This positive effect decreased in the following years in most of intercropped stands, due to light competition with the crown of companion species. Carbon isotope data showed that P. alba and J. regia had the highest intrinsic water use efficiency when growing with Elaeagnus umbellata Thunb, a shrubby species with a shallow root system that favors a non-competitive exploitation of soil water resources. Finally, the intercropping of the principal species with Corylus avellana L. promoted the highest soil C stock. Our findings confirmed the importance to consider the plantation dynamics and wood formation in the long-run and to apply appropriate thinning and pruning interventions to counteract interspecific competition.

AB  - Background: Cork oak agroforestry systems (AFS) have been managed for centuries by humans to produce cork and other goods and services and have recently been recognised as an important reservoir for biodiversity improvement and conservation. However, despite having recently been included as a natural habitat of community-wide interest within the EU Habitats Directive, these systems are in a critical situation of decline. Among other factors, they are strongly threatened by climate change, the effects of which are also expected to be particularly severe in the Mediterranean region. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the influence of climate variability by examining primary production indicators and also to analyse whether the geographical location may have a role in the incidence of the adverse effects of climate. Methods: Cork oak AFS were identified in the Forest Map of Spain and the Land use map of Portugal and categorized on the basis of canopy cover. Seasonal climate data from 2001 to 2020 were used to model relationships with climate predictors and proximity to the coast. Hotspot analysis was conducted to identify significant spatial clusters of high-and low-efficiency areas. Results: The responses to the influence of climatic conditions differed among the various cork oak AFS categories, particularly in the forest category, which was less dependent on climate variations. Relative humidity and water availability were the main drivers of net primary production (NPP). Carbon use efficiency (CUE) was limited by relative humidity and spring temperature in open ecosystems. Proximity to the coast proved beneficial, especially in years with adverse weather conditions, but was not a limiting factor for survival of the ecosystem. Finally, the results of the hotspot analysis supported the other findings, highlighting high-efficiency areas close to the coast and cold spots grouped in specific areas or dispersed inland. Conclusions: Canopy plays a key role in the influence of climatic conditions, particularly in forest categories in which a high density seems to generate microclimate conditions. Water availability, both via the soil and air moisture, is the main driver of primary production, reflecting different adaptive strategies. The oceanic atmosphere may act as a buffer in years of extreme drought.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi play an important role in mediating plant-soil interactions across succession stages. However, AMF community dynamics which about the change of community composition and member activity remain unclear. To complete the gap knowledge about microbial community dynamics during restoration succession, soil AMF community composition was studied within a tropical forest ecosystem in the Ganshiling nature reserve using high throughput sequencing methods. The results revealed that soil AMF communities characteristics about speices diversity, species composition and microbial correlation network showed significant differences between shrubland (SC) and secondary forest ecosystems, but the same differences were not found between 40-year recovery secondary forest (SF40) and 60-year recovery secondary forest (SF60). Plant community dynamics were the key factor for regulating soil AMF communities among succession stages. An important biotic factor explaining variance in AMF community composition was root biomass. The correlation network analysis showed that although the nodes were similar among succession stages, the complexity of networks was significant higher in SF40 than in SC and SF60, suggesting that AMF communities were more active in SF40, which verified the hypothesis of intermediate disturbance hypothesis. This study provides new insights into AMF community dynamics and their driving factors across succession stages, as well as expanding knowledge of the ecological value of AMF for tropical forest restoration processes.

AB  - Forests are in the spotlight: they are expected to play a pivotal role in our response to society's greatest challenges, such as the climate and biodiversity crises. Yet, the forests themselves, and the sector that manages them, face a range of interrelated threats and opportunities. Many of these are well understood, even if the solutions remain elusive. However, there are also emerging trends that are currently less widely appreciated. We report here the results of a horizon scan to identify developing issues likely to affect UK forest management within the next 50 years. These are issues that are presently under-recognized but have potential for significant impact across the sector and beyond. As the forest management sector naturally operates over long timescales, the importance of using good foresight is self-evident. We followed a tried-and-tested horizon scanning methodology involving a diverse Expert Panel to collate and prioritize a longlist of 180 issues. The top 15 issues identified are presented in the Graphical Abstract. The issues represent a diverse range of themes, within a spectrum of influences from environmental shocks and perturbations to changing political and socio-economic drivers, with complex emerging interactions between them. The most highly ranked issue was 'Catastrophic forest ecosystem collapse', reflecting agreement that not only is such collapse a likely prospect but it would also have huge implications across the sector and wider society. These and many of the other issues are large scale, with far-reaching implications. We must be careful to avoid inaction through being overwhelmed, or indeed to merely focus on 'easy wins' without considering broader ramifications. Our responses to each of the challenges and opportunities highlighted must be synergistic and coherent, involving landscape-scale planning. A more adaptive approach to forest management will be essential, encouraging continual innovation and learning. The 15 horizon scan issues presented here are a starting point on which to build further research, prompt debate and action, and develop evidence-based policy and practice. We hope that this stimulates greater recognition of how our forests and sector may need to change to be fit for the future. In some cases, these changes will need to be fundamental and momentous.

AB  - Identifying soil characteristics associated with the plant's resource use and acquisition strategy at different scales could be a crucial step to understanding community assembly and plant strategy. There is an increasing trend that plant functional properties can be an important driver of ecosystem functioning. However, major knowledge gaps exist about how soil abiotic properties, shape species diversity, above-ground biomass (AGB) and plant functional diversity in the Bawangling tropical forest (TCF) of Hainan island. Hence we hypothesized that plant functional traits and above-ground biomass would be strongly associated with soil abiotic factors given their direct relationship to soil resource acquisition and use. Here, we used 12 plant functional traits (FTs), above-ground biomass (AGB), and five soil nutrients in the Bawangling tropical cloud forest of Hainan Island by using a polynomial regression model and multivariate correlations to show relationship and identify how plants allocate their limited resources to adapt to their surroundings. Various phytosociological attributes were assessed and an Importance Value Index (IVI) value was calculated for each species to determine the dominant species. More than half of the total variations could be attributed to interspecific variations in H, DBH, LA, LMA, and LDW. From a taxonomic perspective; we found that species-level variance was more significant for plant functional traits and soil nutrients like TN, AP, TP, and OM. On the other hand, variation in specific stem density (SSD), leaf thickness (LT), leaf phosphorus (LP) and leaf soluble sugar (LS) was an exception for these tendencies. Among soil nutrients, soil nitrogen and phosphorus significantly impact the species and functional traits. Furthermore, the soil AN and TP we also found to have a comparatively strong positive relationship with above-ground biomass (AGB) as compared with other soil nutrients. The morpho-physiological functional traits showed a trade-off between conservative and acquisitive resource usage. These variations suggested that the relationships of functional traits, AGB, and species with soil nutrients mainly AN and TP in tropical cloud forests can directly affect the growth, reproduction, and survival of the species and are beneficial for the species co-existence and maintenance of biodiversity.

AB  - Agroforestry integrates woody perennials with arable crops, livestock, or fodder in the same piece of land, promoting the more efficient utilization of resources as compared to monocropping via the structural and functional diversification of components. This integration of trees provides various soil-related ecological services such as fertility enhancements and improvements in soil physical, biological, and chemical properties, along with food, wood, and fodder. By providing a particular habitat, refugia for epigenic organisms, microclimate heterogeneity, buffering action, soil moisture, and humidity, agroforestry can enhance biodiversity more than monocropping. Various studies confirmed the internal restoration potential of agroforestry. Agroforestry reduces runoff, intercepts rainfall, and binds soil particles together, helping in erosion control. This trade-off between various non-cash ecological services and crop production is not a serious constraint in the integration of trees on the farmland and also provides other important co-benefits for practitioners. Tree-based systems increase livelihoods, yields, and resilience in agriculture, thereby ensuring nutrition and food security. Agroforestry can be a cost-effective and climate-smart farming practice, which will help to cope with the climate-related extremities of dryland areas cultivated by smallholders through diversifying food, improving and protecting soil, and reducing wind erosion. This review highlighted the role of agroforestry in soil improvements, microclimate amelioration, and improvements in productivity through agroforestry, particularly in semi-arid and degraded areas under careful consideration of management practices.

AB  - Peatland forest in the Kampar peninsula have converted into various land uses, mainly converted to palm oil plantation. The massive conversion has decreased biodiversity, changed the hydrological cycle, and increased the peatland fire that dramatically decreased the quality of the peatland ecosystem. It is essential to understand the peatland characteristics and its hydrological cycle to develop sustainable peatland management. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of peat soil and the response of groundwater level to rainfall on burned peatland, mixed plantation and primary peat swamp forests in Siak district. The study was conducted from July to December 2018 by using a hydrometeorological station equipped with rainfall and groundwater level sensors. Disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were analyzed to identify the soil characteristics. The response of groundwater level to rainfall was analyzed using simple regression. The results showed that the burned peatland and mixed plantation have increased bulk density, decreased soil porosity, and caused a decrease of water infiltration. Simple regression analysis between the rainfall and the increase of GWL on the primary peat swamp forest resulted in 0.941 (P)(0.5106) and an R-2 value 0.6189, meanwhile on the burned peatland resulted in 1.2127(P)(0.7818) and an R-2 value 0.8616, and on the mixed resulted 0.7455 in (P)(0.7831) and an R-2 = 0.7557.

AB  - Leaf abundance of trees plays a dominant role in energy, water and nutrient flux of forest ecosystems, in defining the habitat structure of entrained biota and in mediating interspecific competition among tree species. We quantified leaf abundance of three dominant tree species (Acer saccharum Marsh.; Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.; Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) for 27 years in mature northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA using annual counts of leaves of each species collected in 117 litter traps (0.1 m2, each). We hypothesized that variation in leaf abundance would reflect known disturbance events and canopy dieback episodes. No significant trend in leaf abundance of the three species over 27 years (1993-2019) was observed in seven reference stands despite known canopy dieback of sugar maple and American beech in these stands, indicating that 1) maple decline preceded our sampling interval and 2) expansion of beech understory compensated for canopy dieback caused by beech bark disease. Leaf abundance temporarily declined significantly in response to known disturbances (ice storm, 34 to 47%; late-spring frost, 13 to 16%). Increased leaf abundance, especially for sugar maple (30%), on a watershed where calcium addition restored acidified soils, was probably associated with increased soil pH, Ca availability and decreased Al. The temporal sequence of decline of paper birch at higher elevations following a severe drought in 2002 also was apparent. Leaf abundance based on leaf litterfall in deciduous forests provides a useful indicator of forest ecosystem function and forest health.

AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a ubiquitous environmental bacterium associated with a wide variety of natural and human-made environments, such as soil, vegetation, livestock, food processing environments, and urban areas. It is also among the deadliest foodborne pathogens, and knowledge about its presence and diversity in potential sources is crucial to effectively track and control it in the food chain. Isolation of L. monocytogenes from various rural and urban environments showed higher prevalence in agricultural and urban developments than in forest or mountain areas, and that detection was positively associated with rainfall. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for the collected isolates and for L. monocytogenes from Norwegian dairy farms and slugs (218 isolates in total). The data were compared to available data sets from clinical and food-associated sources in Norway collected within the last decade. Multiple examples of clusters of isolates with 0 to 8 whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) allelic differences were collected over time in the same location, demonstrating persistence of L. monocytogenes in natural, urban, and farm environments. Furthermore, several clusters with 6 to 20 wgMLST allelic differences containing isolates collected across different locations, times, and habitats were identified, including nine clusters harboring clinical isolates. The most ubiquitous clones found in soil and other natural and animal ecosystems (CC91, CC11, and CC37) were distinct from clones predominating among both clinical (CC7, CC121, and CC1) and food (CC9, CC121, CC7, and CC8) isolates. The analyses indicated that ST91 was more prevalent in Norway than other countries and revealed a high proportion of the hypovirulent ST121 among Norwegian clinical cases.
   IMPORTANCE Listeria monocytogenes is a deadly foodborne pathogen that is widespread in the environment. For effective management, both public health authorities and food producers need reliable tools for source tracking, surveillance, and risk assessment. For this, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is regarded as the present and future gold standard. In the current study, we use WGS to show that L monocytogenes can persist for months and years in natural, urban, and dairy farm environments. Notably, clusters of almost identical isolates, with genetic distances within the thresholds often suggested for defining an outbreak cluster, can be collected from geographically and temporally unrelated sources. The work highlights the need for a greater knowledge of the genetic relationships between clinical isolates and isolates of L. monocytogenes from a wide range of environments, including natural, urban, agricultural, livestock, food production, and food processing environments, to correctly interpret and use results from WGS analyses.

AB  - As in many countries worldwide, deterioration of quality of water in Morocco's natural reserves continues, such that an inventory of qualities of these reserves has become necessary. Based on statistical analyses of the data collected by measuring nineteen physicochemical variables, and applying an index, the comprehensive pollution index, to those data, the quality of the waters of Lake Dayat Roumi, Morocco, were assessed. Waters of the lake are currently characterized by a salinity of 921.7 mg Cl-/L and 124.2 mg sulfates/L. The concentration of chloride exceeds the value indicated in the standard norms. This can affect the composition of the sediment, overlying water, and specific composition of biota in the lake. Status and trends of values of other parameters also indicate deterioration of water quality in this lake. Multivariate statistical analysis made it possible to differentiate four clusters of samples according to their physicochemical characteristics. These groups are due to inputs from three sources of materials: leaching of rocks from the watershed and plantations, discharge of domestic wastewater and runoff water. Samples taken from deeper parts of the lake indicate a depression of concentrations of dissolved oxygen during the hot season. The analysis results demonstrate the heterogeneous degradation of the water quality in the peripheral areas and deep parts of the lake, favored by the leaching of soils by rainwater, which, when sufficiently severe, can cause repeated mortalities of fishes. This situation requires regular water quality monitoring to develop a management plan for restoration of water quality in the lake to preserve valued ecological services.

AB  - Studies of plant phenology have been performed predominantly with terrestrial species and rarely so with aquatic communities. Such plants are fundamental for the aquatic ecosystems, representing a valuable source of resources when they are scarce in terrestrial environments for the fauna. Studies of phenology help to understand the reproduction rhythms of plant communities and provide fundamental support to management and conservation. This study aimed to describe the reproductive phenology of 15 species of aquatic plants and determine how it is related to climatic factors and physicochemical variables of water. Plants were collected every 15 days throughout a single year, from two ponds in the Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone, Central-West Brazil. Species were observed in flower and fruit throughout the year with varying phenophases among life forms (amphibious, emergent, rooted, floating and rooted submerged). Photoperiod stood out among climatic variables for flowering and fruiting times. Phenophases were explained by climatic factors, as well as by physicochemical variables of the water. Nitrogen and pH were the variables most related to the highest number of phenophases of different life forms. Such information is relevant to understanding how physicochemical alterations to water by pollution, eutrophication and siltation, among others, can change the phenology of aquatic macrophytes.

AB  - The Loess Plateau is one of the most fragile ecosystems in the world. In order to increase the biodiversity in the area, develop sustainable agriculture and increase the income of the local people, we simulated the potential geographic distribution of two economic forest trees (Malus pumila Mill and Prunus armeniaca L.) in the present and future under two climate scenarios, using the maximum entropy model. In this study, the importance and contributions of environmental variables, areas of suitable habitats, changes in habitat suitability, the direction and distance of habitat range shifts, the change ratios for habitat area and land use proportions, were measured. According to our results, bioclimatic variables, topographic variables and soil variables play a significant role in defining the distribution of M. pumila and P. armeniaca. The min temperature of coldest month (bio6) was the most important environmental variable for the distribution of the two economic forest trees. The second most important factors for M. pumila and P. armeniaca were, respectively, the elevation and precipitation of the driest quarter (bio17). At the time of the study, the area of above moderately suitable habitats (AMSH) was 8.7967 x 10(4) km(2) and 11.4631 x 10(4) km(2) for M. pumila and P. armeniaca. The effect of Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 5-85 was more dramatic than that of SSP1-26. Between now and the 2090s (SSP 5-85), the AMSH area of M. pumila is expected to decrease to 7.5957 x 10(4) km(2), while that of P. armeniaca will increase to 34.6465 x 10(4) km(2). The suitability of M. pumila decreased dramatically in the south and southeast regions of the Loess Plateau, increased in the middle and west and resulted in a shift in distance in the range of 78.61 similar to 190.63 km to the northwest, while P. armeniaca shifted to the northwest by 64.77 similar to 139.85 km. This study provides information for future policymaking regarding economic forest trees in the Loess Plateau.

AB  - Tropical forests are complex systems containing myriad interactions and feedbacks with their biotic and abiotic environments, but as the world changes fast, the future of these ecosystems becomes increasingly uncertain. In particular, global stressors may unbalance the feedbacks that stabilize tropical forests, allowing other feedbacks to propel undesired changes in the whole ecosystem. Here, we review the scientific literature across various fields, compiling known interactions of tropical forests with their environment, including the global climate, rainfall, aerosols, fire, soils, fauna, and human activities. We identify 170 individual interactions among 32 elements that we present as a global tropical forest network, including countless feedback loops that may emerge from different combinations of interactions. We illustrate our findings with three cases involving urgent sustainability issues: (1) wildfires in wetlands of South America; (2) forest encroachment in African savanna landscapes; and (3) synergistic threats to the peatland forests of Borneo. Our findings reveal an unexplored world of feedbacks that shape the dynamics of tropical forests. The interactions and feedbacks identified here can guide future qualitative and quantitative research on the complexities of tropical forests, allowing societies to manage the nonlinear responses of these ecosystems in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Native plants that expanded into new geographical areas after human-induced disturbances and climate change are referred to as expansive species. This study aimed to model the current and future distribution of Cadia purpurea and Tarchonanthus camphoratus, two expansive shrubs in the Desa'a dry Afromontane Forest in northern Ethiopia, and analyze their socio-economic impacts. Using ArcGIS and MaxEnt, the distributions were modeled under two shared socio-economic pathways (SSP2.6 and SSP8.5) of climate change scenarios for three time periods: 1970-2000 (current), 2050s, and 2070s (future). About 124 records of species occurrence, elevation, aspect, slope, and 19 bioclimatic variables were used to determine the current and future distribution. The socioeconomic impacts of the two expansive shrubs were assessed through household surveys, focus group discussions, and interviews with key informants. We used a t-test for continuous variables and a chi-square for categorical variables to test the significance of differences in means between invaded and uninvaded areas by the expansive shrubs using R software. The result showed that the mean area under the curves (AUC) for the replicate runs were 0.901 and 0.903 for Cadia purpurea and Tarchonanthus camphoratus, respectively, indicating that the model's predicted result was very accurate and reliable. Precipitation was determined to be the most significant bioclimatic variable, accounting for 82.6% and 79.5% of the variability in the distribution of Tarchonanthus camphoratus and Cadia purpurea, respectively, in the study area. The socio-economic result indicated that human activities such as illegal cutting, settlement expansion, road construction, agricultural expansion, and free grazing were found to facilitate the spread of these species. The expansive species provide a number of services, such as firewood, charcoal production, construction material, shading, erosion control, bee forage, medicine, and fencing. However, they also have adverse impacts, such as biodiversity loss, reduced crop yields, reduced water sources, suppressed grass growth, and reduced tourism income. Local communities recommended physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms to manage and control the expansion of these species in the Desa'a forest, as their negative impacts outweigh their positive impacts.

AB  - The biodiversity in Amazon forest soils is continuously challenged by anthropogenic activities or disturbances, impacting the quantity and quality of its natural resources and a wide range of ecosystem services. Understanding microbial processes and response to various soil management practices provide valuable information to maintain sustainable ecological environments. We hypothesized that microbial assemblages (several not yet identified) and activities are continuously changing in forest ecosystems, mostly due to management selections. Therefore, our work's objective was to assess bacteria communities' changes via next-generation sequencing techniques and bridge knowledge gaps in our understanding of their responses to deforestations, intensive agriculture, and repeated forest burning activities in altered and native forest locations in the Northern Amazon Rainforest, Brazil. We evaluated soils during different climatic periods (dry and rainy) collected at selected sites for pasture, conventional agriculture, and forestry. Intensive conversion to pasture and conventional plantations seriously impacted the bacterial diversities and species richness. The forest area presented the greatest bacterial diversities and species richness, followed by the pasture areas, especially in the 0-5 cm soil layer. Conventional plantations showed the lowest diversities and species richness. There was no change in species richness between the dry and rainy periods; however, the wet period showed lesser species diversities. Based on the analyses, the bacterial communities comprised of the phyla: Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Cyanobacteria. Bacteria trends identified are being considered in future management decisions to preserve biodiversities and the region's forest ecosystems' functioning.

AB  - Mining contributes to the global economy on different scales and plays a fundamental role in the development of the goods and services sectors. However, the negative impacts caused by the activity are unavoidable, as they intensely degrade soil structures and modify landscapes. The use of native tree species has been effective in restoring the structure and functions of post-mining ecosystems in the Amazon. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate chemical indicators of soil quality, survival and initial growth of six tree species planted in degraded ecosystem by kaolin mining under the effects of liming in three pit volumes in the Eastern Amazon. The initial conditions indicated highly degraded soil, with acidic pH, low content of OM, P and K. Liming significantly reduced the level of toxic Al in the soil and provided Ca and Mg for the plants. Through Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we found that the two first components explained 69.30% of the variance of 13 functional indicators of soil quality. PC1 was positively correlated with Ca, Mg, K, SB, CEC and V% and negatively correlated with H+Al and Al saturation. Survival was higher than 80% for Clitoria fairchildiana in all treatments. Liming and pit volume were determining in growth, with high growth rates in height of Inga edulis, Inga cayennensis, Clitoria fairchildiana and Tachigali vulgaris. The species used in this study presented good initial development in restoring ecosystems after kaolin mining.

AB  - Located in the hearth of Africa, the Congo basin is the world's second largest rainforest ecosystem, spanning over nine countries including the Republic of the Congo. Nature-based solutions, i.e., afforestation, reforestation or agroforestry supplying wood energy, halting food insecurity, restoring land desertification and fostering mitigation and adaptation to climate warming, have been increasingly used in the past decades. Within this framework, Congolese coastal plains have been afforested using fast growing trees since the early 1950s. Due to the low forest productivity and soil fertility, sustainable management of these forest ecosystems (trees, soils and environment) have been performed. Improved germplasms, increased stand wood biomass and healthier soils have the potential to enhance wood and fuel wood energy supply, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, food security, restoration of land and ecosystem biodiversity. This meets ten out of the seventeen sustainable development goals (SDG #), specifically goals related to alleviating poverty (1) and hunger (2), improving health (3), education (4), sanitation and access to clean water (6). Other goals include providing affordable clean energy (7), sustainable production and consumption (12), action on climate change (13), life on land (15), and partnerships for goals (17). Nature-based solutions help to face important societal challenges meeting more than half of SDGs of the United Nations.

AB  - Forest management influences a variety of ecosystem structures and processes relevant to meso- and microclimatic regulation, but little research has been done on how forest management can mitigate the negative effects of climate change on forest ecosystems. We studied the temperature regulation capacity during the two Central European extreme summers in 2018 and 2019 in Scots pine plantations and European beech forests with different management-related structural characteristics. We found that the maximum temperature was higher when more trees were cut and canopy was more open. Logging 100 trees per hectare increased maximum temperature by 0.21-0.34 K at ground level and by 0.09-0.17 K in 1.3 m above ground. Opening the forest canopy by 10% significantly increased T-max,T- measured 1.3 m above ground by 0.46 K (including pine and beech stands) and 0.35 K (only pine stands). At ground level, T-max increased by 0.53 K for the model including pine and beech stands and by 0.41 K in pure pine stands. Relative temperature cooling capacity decreased with increasing wood harvest activities, with below average values in 2018 (and 2019) when more than 656 (and 867) trees per hectare were felled. In the pine forests studied, the relative temperature buffering capacity 1.3 m above ground was lower than average values for all sample plots when canopy cover was below 82%. In both study years, mean maximum temperature measured at ground level and in 1.3 m was highest in a pine-dominated sample plots with relatively low stand volume (177 m(3) ha(-1)) and 9 K lower in a sample plot with relatively high stock volumes of Fagus sylvatica (>565 m(3) ha(-1)). During the hottest day in 2019, the difference in temperature peaks was more than 13 K for pine-dominated sample plots with relatively dense (72%) and low (46%) canopy cover. Structural forest characteristics influenced by forest management significantly affect microclimatic conditions and therefore ecosystem vulnerability to climate change. We advocate keeping the canopy as dense as possible (at least 80%) by maintaining sufficient overgrowth and by supporting deciduous trees that provide effective shade.

AB  - Land use-land cover (LULC) alteration is primarily associated with land degradation, especially in recent decades, and has resulted in various harmful changes in the landscape. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has the prospective capacity to classify the vegetative characteristics of many ecological areas and has proven itself useful as a remote sensing (RS) tool in recording vegetative phenological aspects. Likewise, the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) is used for quoting built-up areas. The current research objectives include identification of LULC, NDVI, and NDBI changes in Jhelum District, Punjab, Pakistan, during the last 30 years (1990-2020). This study targeted five major LULC classes: water channels, built-up area, barren land, forest, and cultivated land. Satellite imagery classification tools were used to identify LULC changes in Jhelum District, northern Punjab, Pakistan. The perception data about the environmental variations as conveyed by the 500 participants (mainly farmers) were also recorded and analyzed. The results depict that the majority of farmers (54%) believe in the appearance of more drastic changes such as less rainfall, drought, and decreased water availability for irrigation during 2020 compared to 30 years prior. Overall accuracy assessment of imagery classification was 83.2% and 88.8% for 1990, 88.1% and 85.7% for 2000, 86.5% and 86.7% for 2010, and 85.6% and 87.3% for 2020. The NDVI for Jhelum District was the highest in 1990 at +0.86 and the lowest in 2020 at +0.32; similarly, NDBI values were the highest in 2020 at +0.72 and the lowest in 1990 at -0.36. LULC change showed a clear association with temperature, NDBI, and NDVI in the study area. At the same time, variations in the land area of barren soil, vegetation, and built-up from 1990 to 2020 were quite prominent, possibly resulting in temperature increases, reduction in water for irrigation, and changing rainfall patterns. Farmers were found to be quite responsive to such climatic variations, diverting to framing possible mitigation approaches, but they need government assistance. The findings of this study, especially the causes and impacts of rapid LULC variations in the study area, need immediate attention from related government departments and policy makers.</p>

AB  - Soil fungi are essential to soil microorganisms that play an important role in the ecosystem's soil carbon cycle and mineral nutrient transformation. Understanding the structural characteristics and diversity of soil fungal communities helps understand the health of forest ecosystems. The transition from tropical rainforest to artificial forest greatly impacts the composition and diversity of fungal communities. Hainan Limushan tropical rainforest National Park has a large area of artificial forests. Ecologists have conducted in-depth studies on the succession of animals and plants to regenerate tropical rainforests. There are few reports on the diversity of soil fungi and its influencing factors in the succession of tropical rainforests in Limu Mountain. In this study, 44 soil samples from five different stands were collected in the tropical rainforest of Limushan, Hainan. High-throughput sequencing of rDNA in its region was used to analyze fungal communities and study their alpha and beta diversity. Analysis of variance and multiple regression models was used to analyze soil variables and fungal functional groups to determine the effects of interaction between fungi and environmental factors. A total of 273,996 reads and 1290 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained, belonging to 418 species, 325 genera, 159 families, eight phyla, 30 classes, and 73 orders. The results showed that the composition of soil fungal communities in the five stands was similar, with ascomycetes accounting for 70.5% and basidiomycetes accounting for 14.7%. alpha and beta diversity analysis showed that soil fungi in Limushan tropical rainforest had high abundance and diversity. Multiple regression analysis between soil variables and functional groups showed that organic matter, TN, TP, TK, and AK were excellent predictors for soil fungi. TP was the strongest predictor in all functional groups except soil saprotroph. Organic matter and total nitrogen were the strongest predictors of soil rot. The transformation from tropical rainforest to artificial forest in Limushan did not change the soil fungal community structure, but the richness and diversity of soil fungi changed. The forest transformation did not lead to decreased soil fungal abundance and diversity. Different vegetation types and soil properties affect the diversity of soil fungal communities. We found that Caribbean pine plantations can improve soil fungal diversity, while long-term Eucalyptus spp. plantations may reduce soil fungal diversity.

AB  - Ecological processes are complex, often exhibiting non-linear, interactive, or hierarchical relationships. Furthermore, models identifying drivers of phenology are constrained by uncertainty regarding predictors, interactions across scales, and legacy impacts of prior climate conditions. Nonetheless, measuring and modeling ecosystem processes such as phenology remains critical for management of ecological systems and the social systems they support. We used random forest models to assess which combination of climate, location, edaphic, vegetation composition, and disturbance variables best predict several phenological responses in three dominant land cover types in the U.S. Northwestern Great Plains (NWP). We derived phenological measures from the 25-year series of AVHRR satellite data and characterized climatic predictors (i.e., multiple moisture and/or temperature based variables) over seasonal and annual timeframes within the current year and up to 4 years prior. We found that antecedent conditions, from seasons to years before the current, were strongly associated with phenological measures, apparently mediating the responses of communities to current-year conditions. For example, at least one measure of antecedent-moisture availability [precipitation or vapor pressure deficit (VPD)] over multiple years was a key predictor of all productivity measures. Variables including longer-term lags or prior year sums, such as multi-year-cumulative moisture conditions of maximum VPD, were top predictors for start of season. Productivity measures were also associated with contextual variables such as soil characteristics and vegetation composition. Phenology is a key process that profoundly affects organism-environment relationships, spatio-temporal patterns in ecosystem structure and function, and other ecosystem dynamics. Phenology, however, is complex, and is mediated by lagged effects, interactions, and a diversity of potential drivers; nonetheless, the incorporation of antecedent conditions and contextual variables can improve models of phenology.

AB  - Willow (Salix caprea), birch (Betula pendula) and aspen (Populus tremula) are common pioneer woody species, however little is known about colonization strategies in large-scale disturbances. Here we have compared the strategies of establishment of these pioneer woody species in unreclaimed sites on a large (1957 ha) spoil heap in Czechia. For all species, seedlings numbers peaked in the 17 year old (successional age -time since overburden heaping) plot, suggesting that initial soil development promotes seedling establishment while covering of the surface by litter and organic layers reduces the establishment of pioneer species. The proportion of willow decreased from the edge of the heap and analysis of the age structure suggests that willow establishment was correlated with the presence of older willows in the vicinity of willows of certain ages (13 and 23 years being particularly important). The proportion of birch increased with its distance from the heap edge, and it is correlated with suitable weather conditions in the year of establishment, mainly July rainfall. Aspen proportion does not change significantly with its distance from the heap edge and year of establishment. It correlates with the number of trees in both surrounding and climatic conditions. Detailed analysis of young trees shows that vegetative propagation by root suckers (offspring) is rare in birch. In willow they represent about half of the trees while in aspen all of the young trees were root suckers derived from older aspen trees. This indicates a different colonization strategy of individual species. Birch is capable of long-distance seed transfer, which establishes most of the population, and its establishment is highly influenced by climatic conditions. Willow spreads massively over a short distance, and its establishment is highly influenced by the presence of 21-23 year old willow in-dividuals in the vicinity. Only few scattered trees are able to establish at longer distances, where they can later spread locally by seeds. Aspen spreads over a long distance in low numbers but when some trees are established it spreads massively locally by clones.

AB  - This study evaluates the sensitivity of the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI), utilizing multitemporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to changing environmental conditions across Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) types in a central European landscape (2017-2020). We observed distinct DHI characteristics for all LULC types, and the DHI responded to an extreme drought year in 2018 with no return to pre-drought conditions except for deciduous forests. The DHI also effectively captured spatio-temporal variability of pedo-climatic conditions. Thus, integrated with ancillary geodata, the DHI enhances traditional categorical LULC maps, offering applications in biodiversity and ecosystem research. Such integrated products could serve as valuable tools for decision makers to formulate sustainable land management strategies and contribute to Sustainable Develop Goal indicators related to land degradation, e.g. by identifying deviations from typical, context-specific DHI profiles as a response to disturbance and environmental stress.

AB  - The ecological transition zones also known as ecotones are specific ecosystems but how global change will affect their biodiversity and functioning is poorly understood. In the case of the areas at the interface between riparian forest and salt meadows the biodiversity conservation remains a major issue. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of a salty environment on Fraxinus angustifolia a non-halophyte species. For this, the photochemistry of PSII was in situ explored during the summer between 2007 and 2016. The predawn maximum quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) was always greater than 0.8 which indicates an absence of chronic photo inhibition induced by salinity. During these years, the light kinetic of the actual quantum yield of PSII (Phi(PSII)) was studied. It appears that this yield is generally higher in salty environments than in the riparian forest. Multivariate analysis, showed that the dissipation regulated light energy faction (Phi(NPQ)), the photochemical quenching (qP) and the Fd/Fs ratio constitute the main explanatory variables of Phi(PSII) changes. The subsequent two-wayANCOVA carried out demonstrated that Phi(NPQ) was weaker in saline environments, suggesting a better efficiency of photosystem collecting antennas. Meanwhile, the analysis of photosynthetic pigments did not exhibited a salt effect except the significant accumulation of chlorophyll a in 2016. In order to address the question of the salt-related toxicity, sodium ion contents in the leaves were found to be identical in the two sites, suggesting the establishment of an energy-dependent mechanism of salt exclusion/retention in roots. The growth rings of F. angustifolia in saline areas highly follows the annual water deficit changes. Between 2007 and 2016, the biomass in the salt meadow was higher with a peak in 2011 representing 60% of the biomass of control individuals. But, since 2011 a continuous decline of growth was recorded. Water conditions seem to constitute a limiting factor even if the photosynthetic apparatus generates the excess metabolic energy necessary to cope with the saline toxicity. This study thus highlighted the plasticity of the photochemistry of the PSII depending to the environmental conditions of the salt meadows. It also shows the vulnerability of an ecotone through the decline in the productivity of a glycophyte with climate change. This augurs for changes in the composition of plant communities which is in favor of strict halophytes.

AB  - BackgroundForest liming is a common practice in many German forests, which aims primarily at improving soil chemical properties that have been negatively impacted by acid rain. Effects on physical functions have not yet been studied widely.AimsThe hypothesis of this study is that chemical changes after liming lead to changes in the physical properties of the humus layer and mineral soil.MethodsWe studied soil physical characteristics (water retention characteristics, air and water permeabilities, and conductivities) of limed and adjacent control plots of sandy to loamy, acidified soils under spruce and beech-dominated stands.ResultsWe found differences between limed and control plots, especially in the humus layer and mineral top soil. Here, air capacity values (representing air-filled macropores at -6 kPa) have experienced an increase, while available water capacities (representing the sum of dewatered mesopores between -6 and -1500 kPa) were reduced to a variable extent. These changes in pore size distributions affected gas diffusion as well as gas permeability positively. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was not affected. Below the top mineral soil, a tendency to a reduced macroporosity and gas permeability was observed, but no clear changes were detected.ConclusionsSmall but significant changes of soil physical properties and functions in the humus layer and top mineral soil are discussed to be an indirect effect of forest liming. Liming improves pH and nutrient availability, which in turn should have stimulated activity and abundance of soil fauna, especially earthworms. Where observed, their activity could explain the observed changes in soil physical properties. We believe that effects below the top soil might be due to mobilization and translocation of soil particles and a clogging of pores, but these depths were only studied at three plots. Compared to common liming practices, however, the investigated sites are characterized by significantly higher lime applications. The effects on practice liming areas in forestry praxis are therefore likely to be smaller than in this study.

AB  - Plant species diversity and composition play crucial roles in many ecosystem services and are largely influ-enced by environmental conditions, as well as natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances. However, our knowledge of the drivers of plant species diversity and composition in the limestone forests of Vietnam, a hotspot of biodiversity, is limited. To fill this knowledge gap, we surveyed plant species in the Cat Ba National Park (CBNP), located on a limestone archipelago. We hypothesised that: (1) topography, acces-sibility and spatial isolation drive the diversity and composition of plant communities in the CBNP and that (2) isolated areas contribute to high floristic regional diversity by supporting unique species assem-blages. We expected high tree species diversity within the tropical limestone forests of the CBNP, but also that: (3) the abundance of non-tree species negatively affects tree regeneration diversity and abundance. Data were obtained from 90 random sample plots (500 m2) and 450 sub-sample plots (25 m2) in three areas of the CBNP. We differentiated four different plant species communities and found a total of 302 species belonging to 112 families. Tree species contributed 50% to total species richness. The distribution of different plant communities in the CBNP was driven mainly by topography; that is, the percentage of rock surface and slope and concomitant differences in soil depth. Contrary to our expectations, isolated areas did not contribute greatly to the CBNP's plant species diversity. It seems that isolated areas and, as in our case, rough topography, may act as natural barriers to seed dispersal, creating an environmental filter for tree species. Across the CBNP, there was no effect of non-tree species on tree species regeneration, but regeneration patterns differed between communities. In species-rich communities growing under favourable site conditions (e.g. low rock surface and slope), greater coverage by non-tree species had an increasingly negative effect on tree species richness and abundance in the regeneration layer. The opposite was observed in communities growing under harsh site conditions. We conclude that plant species di-versity in the CBNP is high, particularly in easily accessible lowland areas where tree species contribute greatly to biodiversity. However, here, non-tree species can even restrict tree regeneration.

AB  - Betung Kerihun National Park (TNBK) is the largest conservation area in West Kalimantan which has an area of 816,693.40 ha with high species diversity, both flora and fauna. One of the constituent ecosystems in TNBK region is its watershed. TNBK region has four sub-watershed which acts as a receiving area and divert rain water from tributaries to the main river (Kapuas River), namely Embaloh, Sibau, Mendalam and Kapuas sub-watersheds. The objective of this study is to evaluate the sub-watershed ecosystem value which affect to distribution of the fish. The Sibau sub-watershed, one of the four sub-watersheds in TNBK plays as supporting ecosystems which have a high influence on the distribution of fish species.This zone also has a function as a site for the local people activity and become as a buffer area. Fish monitoring data in 2018 conducted on three rivers i.e. Peang River, Menyakan River and Sibau River which locateson the traditional zones show a high status indiversity. There are 25 species of fish which successfully recorded in the fish distribution monitoring with a total of 242 individuals. The common species were Batu fish (Labocheilos falcifer), Seluang fish (Rasbora voltzii), and Kenyuar fish (Luciosioma setigerum). The biophysical conditions of the river in the Sibau sub-watershed seem suitable for the habitat of many fish species.The determinant factors were water temperature, turbidity, river canopy and pH. The obtained fish can also be categorized as a bioindicators of a waters by considering of those aspects. Most of the fish species are directly or indirectly dependent on the forest or river in providing food such as plant materials (leaves, flowers, fruits) or invertebrates. Sibau sub-watershed has a rich of vegetation, as well the type of alluvial soils that make up the land. The alluvial soils have better fertility rates than other types of soils. In addition, high rainfall (2,863 - 5,517 mm/year) and dense river canopy also have an important influence on fish life in the Sibau sub-watershedwaters.

AB  - Many people in different African countries are suffering from different diseases many of which result in serious life threat and public health problems with high risk of infection and mortality. Due to less accessibility and high cost of modern drugs, people of this continent often depend on traditional medicine using medicinal plants to manage the diseases. Africa has large tropical rain forests, which are very rich in medicinal plants. Many of them have been scientifically proven for their medicinal values. These medicinal plants which constitute a large repertoire of endophytes have not been significantly explored for the isolation of these microorganisms and their bioactive secondary metabolites. This review summarizes the research on endophytes isolated from medicinal plants of Africa, their pharmacological potential and some of their biotechnological aspects. Novel compounds reported from endophytes from Africa with their biological activities have also been reviewed. Information documented in this review might serve as starting point for future researches on endophytes in different African countries.

AB  - CONTEXT: Farmers in rainfed areas of South Asia depend on livestock to augment income, and provide manure for soil and crops. However, the full potential of the livestock is not realized due to the non-availability of quality fodder. The deficit may be attributed to limitation in expansion of cultivable land as well as non-availability of fodder from the protected forest areas. It is possible to enhance the productivity of the livestock by crop-livestock systems. OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine the crop and fodder production potential, nutritive value of the fodder, and reductions in soil nutrients loss and pests of the seven fodder-based inter-cropping systems in a rainfed region in South India.METHODS: A medium-term field experiment was conducted from 2015 to 2021 at the Gungal Research Farm of ICAR's Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (17o05' N, 78o39'E) with seven fodder-based cropping systems involving conventional crops either alone or in combinations with annual or perennial fodder species. The seven systems (treatments) were: sorghum + pigeon pea -hedge lucerne, sorghum + pigeonpea -guinea grass, castor -hedge lucerne, castor -guinea grass, sorghum -fodder -clusterbean -fodder-cowpea -fodder-horsegram, sole sorghum, and sole pigeonpea. Impacts of these systems on crop and livestock productivity, reductions in surface soil erosion and nutrient loss, and soil health and pest dynamics were studied. Livestock based studies were also conducted with the harvested fodders.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that sorghum + pigeonpea-hedge lucerne on average can produce 3865 kg ha-1 of sorghum grain equivalent yield and 37,820 kg ha-1 of sorghum fodder equivalent yield. The sorghum + pigeon pea-guinea grass would benefit the farmers with no animals, by selling the high biomass grass fodder and minimizing the risk of crop failure. These two systems are also better in providing green fodder for at least 8-9 months without any supplementary irrigation. We also observed increase in soil N, OC and soil mi-crobes. There was reduction in runoff (by 51-52%) and sediment loss (by 52%), and reduced pest and disease incidence in these systems.SIGNIFICANCE: Our study demonstrated that perennial fodder-based cropping systems are an excellent option to enhance the sustainability and livelihood security of rainfed farmers by reducing the risk of crop failure and supporting the livestock. These systems also open up the scope of integrating tree fodders especially in the bunds and farm borders.

AB  - Diversity, permanence, and activity of terrestrial arthropods were investigated in four areas of different land use in the lowlands of the Pacific coast of Colombia with the aim to identify potential predator species for the palm root borer, Sagalassa valida. Ten pitfall traps were established along a 100 m transect in four areas: a secondary forest, a 20 year.-old peach palm plantation, and two hybrid oil palm plantations of three and seven years of age, respectively. Twenty-two collections were made covering a whole year. All ants were identified to species or morphospecies level, the other arthropods to order or where possible to family level. In total, 50,603 arthropods were captured, the most abundant were ants (37.0 %), followed by Collembola (35.4 %), Acari (10.6 %), Coleoptera (7.0 %) and Diptera, Hemiptera and Araneae in almost equal numbers (around 2.5 %). Orthoptera (92 % Gryllidae) were present in all collections, always at low numbers. The highest number of ants were recorded in the oil palm transects; Diptera, Hemiptera and Orthoptera were more numerous in the secondary forest, Acari, Araneae and Collembola in the palm transects. Ectatomma ruidum was by far the dominant ant species (84.9 % of all specimens) and absent from only 20 of the 880 captures. The second most frequent ant genus were army ants with two species, Labidus praedator and L. coecus. Rainfall, even area-wide flooding, and temperature did not explain variability in captures of any taxonomic group satisfactorily. We conclude that E. ruidum might be the predator to provide control of the root borer and recommend further studies on its efficiency.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity as bioindicators of litter arthropodofauna in pasture restoration in the Atlantic Forest Biome. Areas of native forest under natural regeneration, and pastures treated with different ecological restoration techniques were evaluated, with pitfall traps. The sampling period was from April/2017 to October/2018, bimonthly. Families Ptiliidae, Staphylinidae, and Leiodidae, species Pheidole cf. sarcina (Formicidae) and Mastigoceras sp. 1 and Szeptyckitheca sp. 1 (Collembola) were indicators of well-conserved areas, whereas families Cicadellidae and Delphacidae, Formicidae species Wasmannia auropunctata (Roger, 1863) and Camponotus melanoticus Emery, 1894 were indicators of degraded areas. From the springtail community, species richness is a metric that can be used as a bioindicator. It was observed that all taxonomic identification levels allowed for the differentiation of the environmental conditions of the sampling areas, with less specific identification levels, such as family, possibly indicating changes in areas under the restoration process.

AB  - In Southeast Asia and Asia, large swathes of rainforest have been converted to rubber plantations, with major consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the impact of this land use conversion on rhizosphere soil mycobiome has not yet been addressed. This study aimed to investigate how rhizosphere soil fungal communities and their associated biological activity (soil respiration, soil methane (CH4), and potential soil enzyme production) are impacted by the conversion of rainforest to rubber plantations. Fungal richness and community composition in rhizosphere soils collected from natural rainforests, immature rubber, and mature rubber plantations were analyzed using paired-end Illumina sequencing. The conversion of natural rainforest to rubber plantations significantly altered fungal community composition of specific functional groups (saprotrophs, pathogens, and mycorrhiza). We observed significant loss of saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in natural rainforests, but enrichment of plant pathogenic fungi in immature rubber plantations. The mechanism underlying the effects of forest conversion on changes in fungal communities is related to reductions in soil pH, total nitrogen (N), and ammonium (NH4) in rubber plantations. Conversion to rubber plantation also resulted in decline of soil respiration rates and less potential for cellulase and chitinase productions. The significant negative correlations between fungal richness and soil respiration in mature rubber plantations indicated high competition among fungi and low nutrient availability in this system. We demonstrate the negative consequences of the conversion of rainforest to rubber plantations on soil biological activity and significant changes in fungal community composition that could threaten long-term ecosystem functions.

AB  - It has been 10 years since the start of the Syrian uprisings. While relative stability is improving overall, a new disaster, wildfires, impacted an already food-insecure population by burning through key production areas, damaging crops, soil, and livestock and causing air quality to deteriorate. As observed with remotely sensed data, fire affected 4.8% of Syria in 2019, as compared with the average 0.2%, and most fires were observed within agricultural land in the northeast. Abnormal amounts of rainfall during the 2019 growing season and, consequently, high soil moisture explained about 62% of the drastic increase in the burned area extent. In contrast, in 2020, fires continued despite the average amount of rainfall. Extremely high temperature could partially explain a 10-fold increase in the extent of burned area in 2020 but only within forested regions in the northwest. We argue that the abrupt changes in Syria's fire activity were driven by the complex interactions among conflict, migration, land use, and climate. On one side, the ongoing conflict leads to a drastic increase in the number of accidental and deliberate fires and reduced capacity for fire response. On the other side, years of insecurity, widespread displacement, and economic instability left no choice for locals other than exploiting fires to remove natural vegetation for expanding farming, logging, and charcoal trading. The loss of agricultural production and natural vegetation to fire can have serious implications for food security, soil property, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, which can further exacerbate the already unstable economy and make ongoing violence even more intense.

AB  - Arthropod declines have been linked to agricultural intensification. However, information about the impacts of intensification is still limited for many crops, as is our understanding of the responses of different arthropod taxa and trophic groups, thus hindering the development of effective mitigation measures. We investigated the impacts of olive farming intensification on canopy-dwelling arthropods in the Mediterranean region. Intensification involves the increased use of agrochemicals, mechanisation and irrigation, but also structural changes from traditional orchards with low densities of large and old trees, to intensive and superintensive orchards with high to very high densities of smaller and younger trees, respectively. Canopy arthropods were vacuum-sampled at 53 sites representing the three orchard intensification levels, in spring, summer and autumn 2017. We evaluated how the arthropod community varied across intensification levels, and in response to orchard structure, management and landscape context. We found no changes in the diversity of arthropod taxa across intensification levels after correcting for sample coverage, but arthropod abundance declined markedly along the intensification gradient. Decreased abundance was associated with changes in orchard structure, lower herbaceous cover, and higher herbicide and insecticide use. The abundance of a specialized olive pest was lower in landscapes with higher woodland cover. The negative effects of intensification were stronger in spring and summer than in autumn, and parasitoids and predators were particularly affected. Overall, results suggest that retaining herbaceous cover, reducing agrochemical inputs and preserving natural woody elements in the landscape, may contribute to mitigate impacts of olive farming intensification on canopy arthropods, particularly on beneficial species.

AB  - Conversion of forest to rubber plantation is one of the most common land-use change in the humid tropical region. It is one of the fastest expanding farms that lead to various socioenvironmental issues. We investigated the effect of this land-use change on soil physico-chemical properties by surveying different succession stage rubber plantations, including monoculture and a mixture derived by mixing jungle rubber and a reference tropical rainforest. We also assessed the impact on stoichiometric ratios and allocation relationships of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Our results demonstrated that conversion of tropical rainforest to rubber monoculture resulted in serious soil degradation, with a lower level of water content, water holding capacities, total porosity, pH, and soil nutrients, and a higher level of soil bulk density. However, after transforming a rubber monoculture into a jungle rubber, the concentrations of soil total C, N, P, Ca, and Mg significantly increased, by 28%, 24%, 23%, 17%, and 39%, respectively. Meanwhile, soil salinity declined by 15%. Jungle rubber also exerted some desirable effects on soil physical properties, such as decreased soil bulk density, increased field capacity and non-porosity by 6%, 2%, and 33%, respectively. Like other tropical regions, soils in the present study areas are mainly under P limitation, but jungle rubber increased soil P turnover and thereby increases P availability. In conclusion, jungle rubber correcting the soil degradation resulted from rubber plantation on tropical forest soil. Given the improvements in soil quality, constructing multiple-strata and multispecies rubber agroforestry (e.g., jungle rubber) can be a promising approach to facilitate the restoration of the existing monoculture rubber plantations.

AB  - Background Tropical tree species can maintain high growth rates on low-phosphorus (P) soils. However, the physiological basis of the high growth rates of tropical tree species remains unknown. Scope Here, we examine how traits related to P uptake and use efficiency might account for this phenomenon. Based on a comparison of plant physiological responses to P and nitrogen (N) limitation, we hypothesize that distinct evolutionary processes have occurred on strongly weathered tropical soils characterized by low P availability relative to weakly and moderately weathered temperate soils characterized by low N availability. Efficient P-use arises through the synthesis of galactolipids rather than phospholipids, small genome size, preferential and flexible P allocation to leaves, efficient P resorption from wood and leaves, tissue longevity, and a decrease in P allocation to reproduction. Efficient P uptake mechanisms include synthesis of phosphatase in roots to acquire organic P from phosphodiesters and phytate, association with mycorrhizal fungi efficient at acquiring P, secretion of organic anions from roots to mobilize soil P, increased mass flow, and modifications of root depth distribution and structure. Conclusions Despite the prevalence of low P soils throughout the tropics, few studies have explored P-use efficiency and acquisition mechanisms in tropical trees. We predict that the wide range of mechanisms by which plants can efficiently acquire and use P maintains productivity and promotes species diversity on low P soils in the tropics and elsewhere.

In a diverse plant community, complementary resource use has been hypothesized to increase the overall productivity, but how diversity effects vary with interacting water and nutrient limitation and through time is not known. Here, we address this knowledge gap in a controlled pot experiment where species composition (two Salix species in monoculture or mixture), nutrient addition, and watering frequency (for fixed total water inputs) were varied during two growing seasons. High nutrient availability promoted plant growth and nitrogen accumulation at the pot scale, as well as increased allocation aboveground, but also triggered more intense water stress and mortality, as larger plants depleted soil water during warm periods. Supplying water more frequently slightly alleviated water stress under high nutrient availability, thus promoting growth and nitrogen accumulation. The species mixtures performed better than the average of the mixture constituents (positive net diversity effects) and increasingly so through time. The complementarity and selection effects, respectively, increased and decreased under both high nutrient availability and high watering frequency. Overall, these results suggest that as plants grow larger, plant interactions and resource partitioning intensify, causing the positive diversity effects, but also that drought consequences might be exacerbated in plant communities rapidly growing thanks to high nutrient supply.

AB  - The interaction and the interplay of climate change with oil palm production in the Southeast Asia region are of serious concern. This particularly applies in Malaysia due to its rank as the second largest palm oil producer in the world. The anthropogenic activities and the agroecological practices in oil palm plantation, including excessive use of fertilisers, bush fire due to land clearing, and cultivation on peatland, have exacerbated the effects of climate change featuring extreme events, drought, flooding, heatwave, as well as infestation of pest and diseases. These adverse impacts on oil palm production highlight the significance of deploying effective adaptation strategies. The study aims to examine the impact of climate change on oil palm production and identify the farmers' adaptation strategies to the impacts of climate change in Malaysia. This study was conducted a comprehensive review of the articles published from 2000 to 2021 in the contexts of climate change and oil palm production in Malaysia. The review shows that climate change has a range of impacts on the oil palm production in Malaysia. As a result, several adaptation options were identified, such as breeding of hybrid varieties that are tolerant and resistant to heat; sustainable management of soil; pit and tranches to enhance water management in plantation areas; minimal use of fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; zero burning; and minimum tillage. The reviewed studies recommended the following to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change: sustainable national policy on climate change, conservation of the existing carbon stock, effective management of tropical rainforest biodiversity, afforestation for carbon sequestration, and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission.

AB  - South Busoga Central Forest Reserve, an isolated reserve in Uganda has been degraded for over forty years. To restore the reserve, the National Forestry Authority established plantations in some parts of the reserve and plans to reserve 40% under native vegetation. Until now, no study exists to inform management of the availability of native species in the degraded area to support natural forest regeneration. The objectives of this study were to: (i) establish if there are seeds of native forest species in the soil seed bank of plantations and unplanted areas (ii) assess the potential of the understory of plantations to serve as 'seed sources'. A seed bank assay of soils from plantations; Eucalyptus grandis, Maesopsis eminii and Pinus caribaea and unplanted areas was performed. Understory vegetation was sampled in 125 subplots of 5 x 5 m, randomly distributed in the plantations. In the seed bank, we recorded a total of 56 species in plantations and 22 in unplanted. There were more species in soils under E. grandis (12) > M. eminii (10) > P. caribaea (9) > unplanted area (3). Apart from Ficus sp. and Drypetes sp. that are woody, the rest of the species were non-woody. In the understory, we encountered a total of 56 species but only fifteen were native tree species with occurrence of less than five individuals each. These results show that sustained forest degradation depletes soil seed banks of native forest species and that plantations of exotic species can also nurse native species in their understory.

AB  - Homestead forests play an important role in climate change adaptation and mitigation. This study investigated homestead forest owners' perceptions on climate change and associated impacts, as well as the role that homestead forests could play to enhance households' climate adaptation in Bandarban hill district of Bangladesh. Methods involved randomly surveying a total of 176 homestead households at three different hill altitudes: low, medium, and high. We also analyzed the meteorological data on local rainfall and temperature for the period of 1990 to 2019. Results showed that most (76-94%) of the homestead forest owners perceived an increasing erratic pattern of annual temperature and rainfall which was supported by the analysis of local meteorological data. Forest owners ' perceptions towards changes in tree phenology, increase in food insecurity, landslides, and pest infestation, and decrease in crop production, soil fertility, and seasonal streamflow were revealed as pieces of evidence of climate change impacts that varied significantly with hill altitudes and associated ecosystems. About 66% to 97% of the housheolds perceived that homestead forests could play a pivotal role in enhancing their capacity to adapt with the changing climate by supplying diverse products, services, and environmental benefits. Understanding and perceptions of the environmental benefits of homestead forests also significantly varied with the type of households ' construction, income, and literacy of the household members. Our results will help policymakers to ensure these small-scale homestead forests are conserved since they could also provide multiple environmental benefits e.g., carbon sequestration in addition to enhancing community climate adaptation.

AB  - IntroductionSeasonal droughts will become more severe and frequent under the context of global climate change, this would result in significant variations in the root distribution and water utilization patterns of plants. However, research on the determining factors of deep fine root and water utilization is limited.MethodsWe measured the fine root biomass and water utilization of trees, shrubs and herbs, and soil properties, light transmission, and community structure parameters in subtropical pine plantations with seasonal droughts.Results and DiscussionWe found that the proportion of deep fine roots (below 1 m depth) is only 0.2-5.1%, but that of deep soil water utilization can reach 20.9-38.6% during the dry season. Trees improve deep soil water capture capacity by enhancing their dominance in occupying deep soil volume, and enhance their deep resource foraging by increasing their branching capacity of absorptive roots. Shrubs and herbs showed different strategies for deep water competition: shrubs tend to exhibit a "conservative" strategy and tend to increase individual competitiveness, while herbs exhibited an "opportunistic" strategy and tend to increase variety and quantity to adapt to competitions.ConclusionOur results improve our understanding of different deep fine root distribution and water use strategies between overstory trees and understory vegetations, and emphasize the importance of deep fine root in drought resistance as well as the roles of deep soil water utilization in shaping community assembly.

AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is central to the global cycles of water and carbon. However, whether increasing tree diversity in forests can increase WUE remains poorly understood because the variation in WUE may result from multiple mechanisms acting concurrently. Disentangling their relative importance represents a major challenge. Here, we conducted a forest biodiversity experiment in subtropical China to assess the effects of neighbouring tree diversity on the foliar WUE of Cunninghamia lanceolata, a widespread tree plantation species in China. We measured foliar delta C-13 as a proxy for the change in intrinsic WUE. To disentangle the relative importance of water and nutrient-mediated mechanisms in altering WUE, we determined foliar nutrient concentrations and foliar delta O-18. Foliar delta O-18 was used as a surrogate for stomatal conductance and is known to be related to plant water use. Foliar WUE of focal trees increased with specific root length and leaf nitrogen content dissimilarities between focal trees and neighbours. The positive neighbourhood dissimilarity effect on foliar WUE was stronger under a more shaded neighbourhood. Foliar P concentration increased with neighbourhood specific root length dissimilarity. However, neither neighbourhood trait dissimilarities nor species richness significantly affect foliar delta O-18. Results from structural equation model suggested that neighbourhood dissimilarity in specific root length indirectly enhanced foliar WUE and tree growth of focal trees via increasing foliar P concentration. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate the potential role of neighbourhood trait dissimilarity in modulating tree WUE in species-rich communities. Our finding implies that the functional diversity of tree species at the local neighbourhood level has a fundamental ability to control water and nutrient cycles in forests.

AB  - Warnings regarding pollution, soil-fertility losses, mass extinction, Climate Change, and their effects on humans are widely known since > 50 years, still land-abuse pervasively remains. Looking into history and geography is needed for understanding the origins, environmental constrains, and ways for abandoning land-abuse. We explored all these guided by the following questions: (a) How the mentality transposed from the West into the Americas became dominant favoring non-sustainable land-managements? (b) How does the environment constrains the sustainability of mass agriculture? (c) Which events carried out by European decision makers, scientists, and activists generated their current support for more sustainable land-uses? We analyzed the importance of primogeniture and profit for transmitting land-abuse practices across generations. We looked into cultural adaptations and environmental constraints to agriculture among Temperate Oceanic Forests. Alpine Humid Tundras, and Neotropical Rain, Wet, and Dry-forests. Finally, we chronologically analyzed (A.D.1938-2018): major agricultural decisions collectively taken by West-European countries, and the development of environmentally-oriented thought and social movements. Primogeniture and profits culturally fixed the subordination of nature and people to a role of mere commodity-producers, making difficult for environmentalism to penetrate decision-making. Low-scale, sustainable agriculture remains traditionally practiced by Neotropical and Alpine indigenous peoples inhabiting fragile ecosystems, but became abandoned by lowland Europeand-Americas' landlords. European environmentalism is related to research-and-teaching of Ecology and Conservation in universities training prospects of both activists and decision makers. Instead, Americas' environmentalists are grass-rooted movements influenced or led by indigenous peoples. Paying traditional, indigenous agriculture is a recent European practice to be encouraged for the Americas.

AB  - Pine barrens ecosystem has acidic, sandy, and nutrient-poor soil and is prone to drought and fire. In the New Jersey Pine Barrens, the predominant pitch pine (Pinus rigida) consists of two ecotypes: the regular pitch pines with heights of 4.6-12 m, and the pygmy pines of low stature (1.2-1.8 m) in the New Jersey Pine Plains. Previous ecological studies suggested that the dwarf pines in the Pine Plains that are embedded within the Pine Barrens were an evolutionary adaptation to frequent fire. Pines are obligate ectomycorrhizal (EcM) mutualists, and their root mycobiota may contribute to stress protection and plant health. However, information on the mycobiota associated with plants in the pine barrens ecosystem is lacking. To have a holistic understanding of the evolution and adaptation in this stressed environment, we used both culture-independent metabarcoding and culture-based method to characterize the mycobiota from soil and root of the two ecotypes and to identify core mycobiota. We found that Agaricomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Mucoromycotina are predominant fungi in the New Jersey Pine Barrens ecosystem, which is rich in root mutualistic fungi. We observed that the pygmy pine roots had significantly higher density of EcM tips than the regular pine roots. This was corroborated by our metabarcoding analysis, which showed that the pygmy pine trees had higher ratio of ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi than the regular-statured pines. We hypothesize that symbiotrophic EcM fungi associated with pygmy pines are capable of mitigating high fire stress in the Pine Plains.

AB  - The expansion of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq, Arecaceae) crops threatens tropical rainforests. It negatively impacts a series of ecosystem services and functions, including carbon (C) sequestration and dynamics, as well as nutrient cycling. Such negative impacts have pressured companies to adopt conservationist practices in palm oil production. And yet the conversion from conventional to organic farming has gained space in the last decade, studies assessing the effects of organic oil palm crops on ecosystem functioning are still scarce. Here, we assessed how alternative farming practices affect organic matter dynamics in oil palm crops. We compared oil palm crops under conventional (CP) and organic (OP) farming in Southeast Amazon. We also sampled lowland dense ombrophilous forest (floresta densa de terra firme, FT) as reference. Soils were sampled at 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth intervals to determine soil physical-chemical properties and C and nitrogen (N) concentrations and stocks. The highest soil C and N concentrations were found at 0-10 cm interval in CP and OP. We detected no variation in soil C and N stocks within depth intervals in FT and CP, while OP had higher soil C and N stocks at the 0-10 cm interval. When comparing OP and CP crops, soil C concentrations and stocks did not vary within zones or depth intervals. All OP zones had higher soil N concentrations and stocks than their conventional counterparts, and we found a variation within depth intervals. Our results show that organic farming has positively influenced organic matter dynamics. Organic oil palm crops preserved and even increased C and N sequestration.

AB  - Australia has suffered more modern mammal extinctions than any nation. Among the list of extinct species is the blue-grey mouse (Pseudomys glaucus), a rodent known from just three specimens (two from southern Queensland and one from northern New South Wales). We investigated circumstances of collection for the three specimens referred to this species to better illuminate optimal habitats and climatic conditions for continuing rediscovery efforts. No additional information could be found on two specimens from southern Queensland sent to the Natural History Museum, London. However, we recorded a first-hand account of how the northern New South Wales specimen was collected and have established that the collection year was 1956. We also obtained a copy of correspondence from Ellis Le G. Troughton thanking the collector for the contribution. The northern New South Wales specimen was from a pastoral property formerly dominated by woodland vegetation communities on alluvial soils. It was captured during a mouse plague following consecutive seasons of above average rainfall. Pseudomys glaucus is likely already extinct, but our results help better direct any future survey efforts. Surveys should be targeted in woodland communities on alluvial floodplains in the Darling Riverine Plains bioregion, following periods of above average rainfall conducive to the irruption of rodent populations.

AB  - Cocoa-based agroforests play an important role in farmer livelihood and the global environment; however, despite these facts, their low yields and tree aging put at risk their fate. This project investigated the carbon storage potential, productivity, and economics of different agroforestry arrangements of cocoa (Theobroma cacao) with Melina (Gmelina arborea) trees, in the southwest of Colombia. We established the experiment under a Randomized Complete Blocks design with seven treatments and three repetitions. Different allometric models were tested. Allometric models were made for G. arborea trees with dbh, ranging between 30.24 and 50.11 cm. The total carbon accumulation fluctuated between 49.2 (Treatment 4) and 88.5 t ha(-1) (Treatment 2), soil organic matter (SOM) ranged between 9 and 17%, bulk density decreased from 0.83 to 0.77 g cm(-3). Cocoa yield ranged between 311 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (Treatment 7, traditional farm) and 922 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (Treatment 6). Treatment 6 showed the best performance with a net present value (NPV) of COP 1,446,467 (US $337.6), an internal rate of return (IRR) of 42%, and a cost-benefit ratio (B/C) of 1.67%. The benefits of AFS were also evidenced in some of the physical and chemical soil properties. Despite local marginality, these cocoa agroforest arrangements are a viable alternative to improve the traditional (local) cocoa systems because cacao agroforest arrangements increased cacao yield and carbon storage becoming a suitable alternative to improve traditional systems.

AB  - BackgroundNutrient cycle in tropical forests is mainly driven by litter fall amounts and by litter decay due to litter physical and chemical properties. Apart from differences in site conditions, different successional stages of tropical rainforests may influence nutrient inputs to the soil via differences in litter fall and decay.MethodsWe studied leaf litter fall, decomposition and related nutrient input to the soil in two secondary tropical rainforest types differing in land-use intensity and history in the lowlands of Sumatra (Indonesia).ResultsMean annual litter fall was by 29.5% higher in the old than in the young secondary forests. In contrast, annual litter decomposition differed only marginally (54.9% vs. 52.1%) in young vs. old secondary forests. Litter chemical composition (C, N, P, K contents) did not differ between the forest types. Litter decomposition was also not different between the forest types (4.6% vs. 4.3% loss of initial weight per month). Consequently, annual nutrient input to the soil was primarily affected by differences in leaf litter production, thus, old secondary forests exceeded that of young secondary forests by 30% and 24% for C and N, but was not different regaring P and K among the two forest types.ConclusionsThe results indicate that litter nutrient inputs to the soil in the two types of secondary tropical lowland forests are most strongly influenced by aboveground litter production rather than litter chemical quality or litter decay. We conclude that the restoration status of secondary tropical lowland forests is crucial for the nutrient status of these forest ecosystems.

AB  - Mining is a major threat for tropical rainforests as it induces rapid land degradation. Reforestation of mined areas is important to mitigate degradation and biodiversity losses. Microbial diversity, which serve as a good indicator of environmental perturbations, is crucial for reforestation and ecosystem functioning. Yet, limited information is available on how it is influenced by mining. We investigated the bacterial and fungal taxonomic alpha (richness and abundance) and beta diversities (Bray-Curtis dissimilarities (BCD)), root traits and nutrients among mined, undisturbed, and reforested soils in a tropical rainforest in Hainan Island (China). Soil organic matter (SOM) content was highly associated with bacterial and fungal abundances, fungal species richness, and BCD. Mining-led vegetation removal largely reduced the SOM, and it decreased bacterial and fungal abundances, fungal species richness, and BCD. After using mined soil to plant multiple fast-growing tree species, the root traits functioned at the levels of an original secondary forest, and it quickly recovered SOM. This process restored bacterial and fungal abundance, fungal species richness, and BCD to originally undisturbed levels. We further conclude that (i) soil fungal diversity in tropical rainforest is more sensitive to mining and reforestation than bacterial diversity. This could be attributed to largely reduced/increased SOM resulting from loss/gain in vegetation during mining/reforestation, respectively. (ii) Reduced SOM, after mining and removal of vegetation, has profound negative influences on tropical rainforest. (iii) Use of mined soil as a post-mining substrate along with fast-growing tree species ensures the recovery of SOM during reforestation, which alleviates the negative impacts of mining on tropical rainforests.

AB  - Mangroves play an important role in coastal ecosystems worldwide, performing vital functions like protecting coastlines, seagrass, and coral reefs, purification of water, trapping sediments, and providing nursery grounds for many terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Despite their importance, mangroves are threatened worldwide due to increasing human development in coastal areas, and therefore, efforts to restore degraded mangrove ecosystems have gained traction. Mangrove restoration requires specialized knowledge and skills, ranging from selecting seeds, to the planting of seedlings in nurseries and along degraded coastlines. The following study explores the survivorship and growth rate of seedlings of three mangrove species - namely Avicennia marina, Rhizophora mucronata, and Ceriops tagal - in freshwater and seawater treatments. The experiment was conducted in a nursery-based environment to inform mangrove rehabilitation programs. Root count and length, leaf count and length, and the length of the entire seedling were measured for each sample species every week for 12 weeks. The data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA to identify significant differences in the measured variables between each species in the freshwater and seawater treatments. Seedlings grown in freshwater revealed a more rapid growth rate and lower mortality relative to those in seawater. Mangrove seedlings can be raised in nursery-based environments. They can be irrigated using freshwater with species like A. marina, less constrained by freshwater and hence display higher growth rates. Therefore, A. marina should be considered a priority species for mangrove restoration, given its relatively higher growth rate than the other species in the experiment.

AB  - Inga edulis and Pentaclethra macroloba are dominant N-fixing forest trees in Costa Rica, likely important for recovery of soil N and C after deforestation, yet little is known of their soil microbiomes nor how land use impacts them. Soils from both trees in a primary and secondary forest were assessed for N-cycle metrics and DNA sequence-based composition of total bacterial, potential N-fixing bacterial, and potential ammonium oxidizing bacterial genera. The compositions of the functional groups of bacteria, but not their total relative abundance of DNA, were different across the soils. The P. macroloba soils had greater NO3- levels and richness of both functional groups, while I. edulis soils had greater NH4+ levels, consistent with its NH4+ preference for root nodule development. The bacterial communities were different by habitat, as secondary forest I. edulis microbiomes were less rich, more dominant, possibly more affected by the disturbance, or reached equilibrium status quicker than the richer, less dominant P. macroloba microbiomes, which may be developing slower along with secondary forest succession, or were less affected by the disturbance. Functional redundancy and switching of 10 N-cycle bacterial genera was evident between the primary and secondary forest soils, likely to maintain stable levels of N-cycle activity following disturbance. In summary, the two tree soil microbiomes are different, land use differentially affects them, and, thus, both tree species should be used during forest regeneration strategies in this region.

AB  - The biogeochemical cycles, carbon sequestration, and climate change all are significantly influenced by tropical rainforests, which is one of the world's most productive ecosystems and hotspots for biodiversity. Plantation crops like Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) have displaced significant forest cover in the Asia pacific in the last two centuries due to their increasing demand. As a case study, we examined the soils of native forest (NF), rubber monoculture (RP) and three different managements i.e., cover crop (CC), weed crop (WC) and inter crop (IC) to understand the changes in microbial community structure across each practice and to estimate the influence of forest conversion to rubber monoculture on the soil microbiome. Soils were collected using nested sampling pattern and subjected to physiochemical characterization and whole metagenome sequencing. Results revealed that bacteria (60.56 M reads) predominated all land use types, followed by eukaryotes (0.52 M reads) and archaea (0.72 M reads). NF exhibited significantly higher bacterial richness and diversity then other land-use type. Interestingly, total functional diversity as well as genes associated with chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, and secretion systems were significantly higher in other land-use systems as compared to NF. Altogether, the results from this study indicate that the three different land use types used here like CC, IC, and WC has high abundance of functional diversity and biological profile compared to NF and RP. The study suggests that the adoption of aforementioned land-use management practices could play a significant role in fostering sustainable plantations in the tropics.

AB  - Aim Perennial plant communities are crucial for regulating ecological processes and maintaining ecosystem functions. Variation in community structure is driven by both biotic and abiotic factors, reflecting adaptation strategies of plant communities to various environments. Although much is known about the response of individual perennial plants to drier climates, empirical evidence of the community-level responses to increasing dryness is limited.

   Methods We measured the abundance and size distribution (median, skewness and variance) of perennial plant communities from different growth forms (trees, shrubs and grasses), the spatial arrangement of trees in the overstorey and both biotic (competition) and abiotic (climate, soil properties) factors at 150 sites along an extensive aridity gradient from humid to arid areas. We used regression analyses and linear models to explore variation in community structure with increasing aridity and key driving factors for different perennial plant communities.
   Results Variation in community structure differed with growth form. As aridity increased, trees had wider canopies and were spatially aggregated, shrubs became miniaturised, but highly variable in size, and grasses comprised more larger individuals. Biotic and abiotic factors exerted different effects on different growth forms, with trees and shrubs consistently affected by competition and aridity, respectively, whereas grasses were weakly affected by aridity, summer rainfall and soil texture.
   Main conclusions Our study highlights the idiosyncratic adaptation strategies used by trees, shrubs and grasses in response to drying climates at the community level through their effect on the size distribution or spatial aggregation. The structure of different perennial growth forms was influenced by different effects from either biotic (competition) or abiotic (climate, soil) factors. Under forecasted drier climates, canopy expansion and greater aggregation of trees might enhance resource sinks and shelter for diverse biota, potentially shielding plant communities against predicted aridification.

AB  - Plant biodiversity data are prerequisites for the sustainable management of a forest. We used quantitative ecological tools to determine the species composition, diversity (richness and evenness), population structure, distribution patterns, and regeneration status of trees in a Tropical Moist Sal Forest of Eastern Ghats, India. For this purpose, a field inventory was conducted during 2020-2022 in sixteen 1.0 ha forest stands along a human-induced disturbance gradient. A total of 161 species (61 trees, 40 shrubs, 60 herbs) belonging to 77 families and 143 genera were recorded in the 16.0 ha of forest area. The results revealed a significant (p < 0.01) decrease in the tree and shrub species density, basal area, species richness, and diversity along the gradient of disturbance. However, in the case of herbs, the Shannon-Weiner diversity index increased significantly (p < 0.01) with increasing disturbance levels. Irrespective of forest types and disturbance levels, the tree diameter class (10-30 cm) accounted for the highest stem density in the forest. A mixed trend was found in the case of the basal area; the >41 cm diameter class constituted the highest basal area in the Pure Sal Forest while the 10-30 cm class was in the Moist Deciduous Forest without Sal. Tree species richness was found higher in lower diameter classes. Disturbances impacted the distribution pattern of trees; in the Pure Sal Forest, the contagious distribution of trees were 61.54%, 40%, and 12.5% in undisturbed, low-disturbed, and moderately disturbed sites, respectively. The percent of trees showing random and regular distribution increased with the increased level of disturbance in all forest types. The number of tree species having good regeneration decreased with the increased disturbance intensity in all forest types. Frequent grazing, repeated forest fires, and poor soil seed banks at the Moderately Disturbed site were the main reasons for the poor/no regeneration of Pterocarpus marsupium, Adina cordifolia, Terminalia bellerica, and some other economical species. Significant changes in structural attributes of the tree community revealed the impact of human-induced disturbances in the Moist Sal Forests of Eastern Ghats. The disturbance mosaics promoted the growth of many invasive weed species and lianas, depleting the number of valuable species in the forest. This study suggests the adaption of sustainable biodiversity conservation approaches through the active participation of the tribal so that the remnants the Moist Sal Forests of Eastern Ghats can be controlled to prevent further degradation.

AB  - BackgroundBiodiversity data is crucial for sustainable development and making decisions regarding natural resources and its conservation. The study goal was to use quantitative ecological approaches to determine the species richness and diversity of wild flora and the ultimate impact of environmental factors on vegetation dynamics. MethodsQuadrats having sizes of 1x1 for herbs, 5x5 for shrubs, and 10x10 m(2) for trees were used. Various phytosociological characteristics were investigated in association with a wide variety of environmental variables. Soil analysis based on texture, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM), available potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) were examined. The existing state of vegetation along the River Chenab was assessed using SWOT analysis and a future conservation strategy was devised. ResultsOne hundred twenty different plant speies were divided into 51 families including 92 dicots, 17 monocots, 6 pteridophytes and 1 bryophyte species. Herbs accounted for 89 followed by shrubs (16 species) and trees (15 species). Correlation analysis revealed a highly positive correlation between relative density and relative frequency (0.956**). Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices elaborated that site 3 and 7 with clay loamy soil had non-significant alpha diversity and varies from site to site. Diversity analysis showed that site 10 was most diverse (22.25) in terms of species richness. The principal coordinate analysis expressed that different environmental variables including OM, soil pH, P, K, and EC affect vegetation significantly, therefore, loamy soil showed presence and dispersal of more vegetation as compared to loam, sandy and sandy loam soils. Further, 170 ppm of available potassium had significant affect on plant diversity and distribution. ConclusionAsteraceae family was found dominant as dicot while poaceae among monocot. Adhatoda vasica was one of the unique species and found in Head Maralla site. For evenness, site 3 had maximum value 0.971. Most of the soil represented loamy soil texture where site 2 and 4 possess high soil moisture content. SWOT analysis revealed strengths as people prefered plants for medicine, food and economic purposes. In weakness, agricultural practices, soil erosion and flooding affected the vegetation. In opportunities, Forest and Irrigation Departments were planting plants for the restoration of ecosystem. Threats include anthropogenic activities overgrazing, urbanization and road infrastructure at Head Maralla, habitat fragmentation at Head Khanki, and extensive fish farming at Head Qadirabad. Future conservation efforts should be concentrated on SWOT analysis outcome in terms of stopping illegal consumption of natural resources, restoration of plant biodiversity through reforestation, designating protected areas and multiplying rare species locally.

AB  - The expansion of livestock production and agriculture is responsible for the increase of deforestation rates in the Amazon rainforest, with consequences to climate and micro and macro biodiversity. Although many studies have evaluated the effects of deforestation on the microbiome, its effect on the soil resistome remains unknown. Considering that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are a threat to global health and food security, here we evaluated how land-use change in the Amazon region impacts the soil resistome. Our analysis revealed that several antibiotic resistance mechanisms and genes are common to both the native forest and the altered areas; however, deforestation and subsequent conversion to other land-use systems increased the diversity and abundance of these genes. The enrichment of ARGs is correlated to increased microbial diversity in response to deforestation, along with changes in soil chemical properties, such as pH and aluminum. Our findings demonstrated that Amazon deforestation enriched ARGs in soil and how anthropogenic disturbances may exert selective pressure on the microbial communities expanding the soil resistome. Further investigation is still needed to understand if the ARGs can be transferred via the food chains (e.g. agricultural soils) to humans, jeopardizing antibiotic treatment effectiveness and compromising public health.

AB  - The surface of the stands affected by drying, located in the meadows of the inland rivers is in continuous growing due to the modification of the hydrological parameters under abiotic, biotic and anthropogenic factors. The forest species frequently used in the past (1970-1990) for afforestation were the hybrid black poplars or the selected willows. Currently, they are less used, due to the change of environmental conditions but also by including them in protected areas, for the detriment of native species. In the paper, are presented data regarding on the characteristics of the stands affected by drying located in research plots from Buzau and Lower Siret meadows. The results bring the environmental potential of the lands by restoration of the affected stands from forest-steppe areas using adequate species adapted to resist on different types of soils, being able to face the new ecotope conditions. The ecological reconstruction of these stands is an urgent need and is the only way to maintain the ecological balance, biodiversity and, at the same time, to capitalize on these categories of land unsuitable for other destinations.

AB  - Jatropha curcas (JC), as a biofuel plant, has been reported to have various desired characteristics such as high oil content seeds (27-40%), fast-growth, easy cultivation, drought tolerance, and can be grown on marginal soil and wasteland, requiring fewer nutrients and management and does not interfere with existing food crops, insects, and pest resistance. This investigation was the first study of its type to use climatological data, blue/green water footprints, and JC seed production to identify suitable sites for JC bioenergy plantation using the AquaCrop FAO model across the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwest Pakistan. The JC seed yield (10 ton/ha) was at a maximum in the districts of Bannu, Karak, Hangu, Kurram, North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan, and Dera Ismail Khan, in addition to its frontier regions, Tank, Peshawar, Mohmand, Orakzai, Khyber, Kohat, Charsadda, Mardan, Swabi, and Nowshera, respectively. Green water footprint (264 m(3)/ton of JC seed) and blue water footprint (825 m(3)/ton) was less in these areas. Furthermore, the results revealed that, depending on climatological circumstances, the southern part of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province is more appropriate for JC bioenergy plantation than the northern region. The districts of Bannu, Karak, Hangu, Kurram, North Waziristan, Lakki Marwat, South Waziristan, Dera Ismail Khan, and its frontier regions, Tank, Peshawar, Mohmand, Orakzai, Khyber, and Kohat, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province were identified to be the most ideal places for JC bioenergy plantation. As a result, under the Billion Tree Afforestation Project (BTAP) and the Green Pakistan Project, the Forest Department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should consider planting JC species in the province's southern region. Furthermore, this research will provide scientific information to government and private sector officials for better management and optimum yield of the JC biofuel crop, as well as for the promotion of energy forestry in Pakistan.

AB  - Natural salt lick (sira) is a strategic localisation for ecological wildlife assemblage to exhibit geophagy which may act as a population dynamic buffer of prey and predators. Undoubtedly, many agree that geophagy at natural licks is linked to nutritional ecology, health and assembly places facilitating social interaction of its users. Overall, natural salt licks not only save energy of obtaining nutrient leading to health maintenance but also forms the basis of population persistence. The Royal Belum Rainforest, Malaysia (Royal Belum) is a typical tropical rainforest in Malaysia rich in wildlife which are mainly concentrated around the natural salt lick. Since this is one of the most stable fauna ecology forest in Malaysia, it is timely to assess its impact on the Malayan tiger (Panthera tigris) home range dynamics. The three-potential home ranges of the Malayan tiger in this rainforest were selected based on animal trails or foot prints surrounding the salt lick viz (e.g. Sira Kuak and Sira Batu; Sira Rambai and Sira Buluh and Sira Papan) as well as previous sightings of a Malayan tiger in the area, whose movement is dependent on the density and distribution of prey. Camera traps were placed at potential animal trails surrounding the salt lick to capture any encountered wildlife species within the area of the camera placements. Results showed that all home ranges of Malayan tiger were of no significance for large bodied prey availability such as sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and smaller prey such as muntjacs (Muntiacus muntjac) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Interestingly, all home range harbour the Malayan tiger as the only sole predator. The non-significance of prey availability at each home range is attributed to the decline of the Malayan tiger in the rainforest since tigers are dependant on the movement of its preferred prey surrounding natural salt licks. Thus, the information from this study offers fundamental knowledge on the importance of prey-predator interaction at salt lick which will help in designing strategy in rewilding or rehabilitation programs of the Malayan tiger at the Royal Belum Rainforest.

AB  - Due to the influence of human activities such as cultivation and urban construction, the ecosystem of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) is subjected to increased vulnerability and even potential risk of destruction. Ecological restoration has led to an increase in vegetation, but excessive afforestation conversely results in low survival rate of trees, water shortages, and biodiversity loss. It is of great significance for achieving sustainable development of forests to reasonable revegetation in the region. At present, the potential distribution pattern of dominant species and their mixed forms in the basin has not been effectively studied. This study simulated the potential distribution of dominant vegetation in the YRB based on Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) and explored the impact of human interference on it by employing land use as the environmental filter to distinguish the regions of human activities. We further predicted the potential distribution of typically mixed forests and discussed their human interference. The main results are as follows: (1) Except for Caragana korshinskii, all models had good above performance (0.7 < the mean AUC < 1). Except for Caragana korshinskii, the area under the curve (AUC) for 90% of the models indicated that MaxEnt performed better than GARP, and MaxEnt easily lead to over-fitting while GARP predicted a wider range. (2) Except for Nitraria tangutorum, the dominant types of vegetation such as Pinus tabulaeformis, Platycladus orientalis, and Hippophae rhamnoides mainly distributed in southern Gansu, Shaanxi, and south-central Shanxi. Among them, the largest suitable area of Artemisia gmelinii and Stipa bungeana (High suitable area) were approximately 56.7x10(4) km(2) (38.8%) and 54.7x10(4) km(2) (28.5%) with the area occupied by large-scale cultivation being 17.5x10(4) km(2) (39.4%) and 18.9x10(4) km(2) (48%), respectively, which indicated human activities caused great damage to the core growth regions of these vegetation. (3) Mean temperature of coldest quarter or month mainly constrained the growth of most vegetation in the YRB in terms of temperature, while precipitation of wettest/driest month is one of the dominant factors. However, some vegetation responded differently to other meteorological factors due to niche differences. (4) Most of the mixed forests were distributed in southern Gansu, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces; its middle and high suitable areas were mainly concentrated in Shaanxi and southern and central Shanxi, where the cultivated land had occupied most of them. Therefore, the results showed that the restoration of herbaceous vegetation such as Artemisia gmelinii and Stipa bungeana has a high potential and it is appropriate that the measures for afforestation should be concentrated in the areas like the lower reaches of the Weihe, Jinghe, and Beiluo rivers and Luliang Mountain, where the cultivated land overlaps with the high suitable areas of the corresponding vegetation and the mixed forests with less water consumption and wide distribution, such as Caragana korshinskii-Hippophae rhamnoides, Pinus tabulaeformis-Quercus liaotungensis, and Ostryopsis davidiana-Stipa bungeana- Hippophae rhamnoides. The results of this study can provide effective guidance for mixed forest plantations and vegetation conservation in the YRB.

AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) serve as a fundamental cornerstone for upholding global biodiversity and promoting human well-being. ESs trade-off and synergy are supposed to be significantly affected by climate change (CC) and land use/cover change (LULC). However, the limited availability of finely classified future land-use data and integrated landscape change models incorporating climate change scenarios has hindered our understanding of the trade-off and synergistic patterns and controls of ESs at multiple scales, particularly in arid areas. Here, a future multi-scenario ESs trade-off/collaborative assessment framework (SD-PLUS-InVEST model) for multi-scale conversion and refined land-use classification was developed by coupling the patch-generated land-use simulation (PLUS) model, system dynamics (SD) model, InVEST model, geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, optimal parameter geographical detector (OPGD) model, and structural equation model (SEM). The four ESs, namely carbon storage (CS), habitat quality (HQ), water conservation (WC), and soil conservation (SC), were assessed. Further, multi-scale ESs were evaluated under different climate change and development scenarios (i.e., the SSP1-2.6 and ecological protection scenario, SSP1-2.6-EP; SSP2-4.5 and natural development scenario, SSP2-4.5-ND; SSP5-8.5 and economic growth scenario, SSP5-8.5-EG). The results demonstrated that the arid region of northwest China (ANWC) was experiencing a significant and continuous warming trend accompanied by increased humidity. There will be a significant decrease in the areas occupied by paddy fields, natural forests, and permanent glaciers among the 24 LULC types. Conversely, there will be a substantial increase in dry land, high-coverage grassland, and urban construction land areas. According to the SSP1-2.6-EP, SSP2-4.5-ND, and SSP5-8.5-EG scenarios, the comprehensive land-use dynamic degrees were estimated to reach 2.58%, 4.08%, and 4.74%, respectively. The LULC resulting from CC exacerbates the differences in the four ESs of ANWC. In particular, CS and HQ experience significant reductions in 2100. Conversely, WC and SC show notable increases during the same period. The changes in CS, HQ, WC, and SC reach 11.36 x 108 m3, 1735.25 x 108 t, -1.29 x 108 t, and -0.009, respectively. The four ESs of CS, HQ, WC, and SC in ANWC display a synergistic relationship. This synergy is influenced by the heterogeneous spatial distribution of CS, HQ, WC, and SC, with the strongest synergy observed between CS and HQ and the weakest between CS and WC. Interestingly, the distribution differences in ESs synergy were amplified at watershed, county, and grid scales in mountainous areas, with the most significant detection differentiation occurring at the grid scale. Furthermore, the detection of spatial heterogeneity in the four ESs can be attributed to various factors. These factors include the drought index (q = 0.378), annual average precipitation (q = 0.375), economic density (q = 0.095), vegetation coverage (q = 0.262), and soil bulk density (q = 0.077). Our results highlight the importance of CC in influencing ESs. The spatial variations in ESs trade-offs and coordination at different scales, particularly the pronounced differences observed in mountainous areas, underscore the need to prioritize the conservation of arid mountainous regions in terms of future policy making.

AB  - Natural enemies have been implicated as agents of negative density dependence (NDD) in tropical forests, but their relative contributions to NDD, and thus to the maintenance of diversity, are largely unknown.
   We monitored the rates of survival and relative growth rates on seedlings for 10 years in tropical moist forest in Manu National Park, Peru. We then experimentally manipulated the plots to exclude fungal pathogens, insects, small mammals and large mammals for an additional 31 months to assess the influence of these natural enemies on density-dependent interactions among tropical seedlings.
   Fungal pathogens made the most important contribution to NDD. The application of fungicide led to lower mortality rates, faster growth rates and decreased species diversity. Other taxa of natural enemies had at most minor effects on seedling performance.
   Synthesis. We conclude that fungal pathogens are the strongest contributors to the widely observed NDD that occurs among seedlings. Moreover, the presence of fungal pathogens augments the species diversity of seedlings, indicating their critical contribution to the maintenance of species coexistence and the structure of tropical tree communities.

AB  - Oil palm is one of the most rapidly growing tree crops in the tropics. It is long-lasting and high yielding, serving as an input for a number of profitable industries. The rapid expansion of oil palm has triggered environmental change. Historically, the focus has been on the impact of biodiversity loss. However, the water requirements of oil palm plantations, which traditionally depended on rainfall only, are also changing, partly because environmental concerns are directing oil palm expansion and cultivation into marginal areas. According to some estimates, these lands with cultivable marginal soils-having an acid pyrite layer in the soil profile-comprise about 7.5 million ha in Indonesia. Here, we employed the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) to simulate the growth of oil palm on marginal lands within Indonesia over an eight year period. APSIM-Oil palm was used to estimate the irrigation water requirement at different stages of plant growth for actual weather and soil conditions. Traditionally, water footprint accounting of oil palm plantations at the field level considers one uniform value of evapotranspiration. Our analysis shows that considering a single value for the entire period of oil palm growth underestimates the water requirement at the field scale. Annual irrigation needs were found to range from 2543 mm to 3865 mm for the plantation ages examined (0-8 years). We approximate that 8800 m(3) of blue water and 6200 m(3) of green water is required per ton of fresh fruit bunch produced from the study plantation occupying marginal lands, where water requirements were largely governed by maintenance of a high water table. Similarly high volumes are likely to be required where oil palm is cultivated on pyritic soils. Thus, the irrigation water requirement can no longer be neglected as oil palm plantations continue to expand onto marginal soils.

AB  - Stand density has obvious effects on understory vegetation - an important part of forest ecosystems. Understory biodiversity in tropical rainforests is important for the natural regeneration potential, which is critical for improving the overall function of forest ecosystem. We investigated the effects on plant species diversity (separated in shrubs, interlayer plants and herbs) and soil physical and chemical properties at five levels of stand density (5000, 6500, 8000, 9500, and 11000 trees.ha(-1)) in tropical rainforests on the Hainan Island, China. The results showed that soil water content increased with stand density, while organic matter content and both total and available phosphorus content was highest in the moderately dense stand. There was no effect of stand density on the diversity of interlayer plant species (climbing vines). The diversity of the interlayer was consistently greater than herbs, especially at high stand density. Diversity of herbs was lowest in the high-density stand (11000 trees.ha(-1)). Species richness and Simpson's index of dominance of the shrub layer and species richness and its Shannon-Wiener diversity index of the herb layer were both highest at moderate stand density (8000 trees.ha(-1)). Species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index of interlayer plants peaked at higher stand density (9500 trees.ha(-1)), and the Simpson dominance index generally increased with stand density, indicating that climbers are more competitive in denser tropical rainforests. Stand density influenced the diversity and composition of understory species. We found positive correlations for understory plant species diversity with soil water content, organic matter content, total phosphorus, and available phosphorus content. Our results indicate that moderate stand densities of 8000-9500 trees.ha(-1) seem optimal for enhancing understory species diversity, soil fertility, stand stability, and natural regeneration. It could be used as target density for managing secondary tropical lowland rainforests.

AB  - Rainfall-induced shallow landslides are widespread throughout the world, and vegetation is frequently utilized to control them. However, in recent years, shallow landslides have continued to frequently occur during the rainy season on the vegetated slopes of the Loess Plateau in China. To better probe this phenomenon, we considered vegetation cover in the sensitivity analysis of landslide hazards and used the transient rainfall infiltration and grid-based regional slope stability (TRIGRS) model to quantitatively describe the impacts of different types of vegetation cover on slope stability. Based on the rainfall information for landslide events, the spatiotemporal distributions of the pore water pressure and the factor of safety of the vegetated slopes were inverted under the driving changes in the soil properties under different vegetation types, and the average prediction accuracy reached 79.88%. It was found that there was a strong positive correlation between the cumulative precipitation and the proportion of landslide-prone areas in woodland covered by tall trees, grassland covered by shrubs and grasses, and cultivated land. The highest landslide susceptibility, which has the greatest potential to hasten the occurrence of rainfall-induced landslides, is found in woodland with tall trees. Therefore, this paper proposes the promoting relationship between vegetation and landslide erosion, which provides a new scientific perspective on watershed management to prevent shallow landslide disasters and manage and develop watershed vegetation.

AB  - Forests play a crucial role as the primary sink for greenhouse gases, and forest mortality significantly impacts the carbon sequestration capacity of forest ecosystems. A single type of forest mortality model has been developed, and its model variables are incomplete, leading to significant bias in mortality prediction. To address this limitation, this study harnessed data collected from 773 permanent plots situated in Zhejiang Province, China, spanning a period from 2009 to 2019. The primary objectives were to pinpoint the key variables influencing forest mortality and to construct forest mortality prediction models utilizing both traditional regression methods and machine learning techniques, ultimately aiming to provide a theoretical basis for forest management practices and future predictions. Four basic linear regression models were used in this study: Linear Regression (LR), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) Stepwise Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. Four machine learning models, Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were used to model stand mortality. Mortality was used as the dependent variable, and environmental factors such as topographic factors, soil composition, stand characteristics, and climatic variables were used as independent variables. The findings unveiled that soil and stand-related factors exerted significant effects on the mortality rate, whereas terrain-related and climate factors did not exhibit statistical significance. The Random Forest model established by using stand age, tree height, ADBH, crown cover, humus layer thickness, and the biodiversity index has the highest fitting statistics such as R-2 and Mean Squared Error, indicating that it has a good fitting and prediction effect, which effectively predicts mortality at the stand level, and is a valuable tool for predicting changes in forest ecosystems, with practical value in estimating tree mortality to enhance forest management and planning.

AB  - Stable isotope tracing of plant water use can illuminate plant water sources. But to date, the number of species tested at any given site has been minimal. Here, we sample 46 tropical hardwood tree species in a 0.32 ha plot with uniform soils. Soil water was characterized at 6 depths at 0.2 m intervals down to 1 m and showed simple and predictable depth patterns of 82H and 818O, and simple and spatially uniform isotope composition at each depth. Nevertheless, tree xylem water 82H and 818O showed remarkable variation covering the full range of soil composition, suggesting strong sorting and niche segregation across the small plot. Wood density, tree size and mean basal area increment together explained approximately 55% of the variance of xylem water isotope composition through principal component analysis. A Bayesian mixing model was applied to the data and showed that sampled trees were either sourcing their water from very shallow or deep soil layers, with very little contribution from the middle portion of the soil profile. The majority of the observed species relied on 0.0-0.2 m depth soil water. This layer contributed approximately 75% of the xylem water which was significantly higher than the contributions from all other depths. The contribution from shallow soil was highest for trees with high wood density, slow-growing trees and small-sized trees. Our work suggests that stable isotope tracers may aid a better understanding of tropical forest water uptake depths and their relation to tree functional traits and potential hydrological niche segregation among co-occurring tropical species.

AB  - On the basis of long-term surveys of permanent plots and traps, we examined the communities of saproxylic beetles, fungi, herbs, and trees on an untreated 22 ha large beech forest windthrow and asked whether the results lend support to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). We studied species richness and the similarity of community composition. Additionally, we grouped species by their frequency trend over time to successional model types to examine whether, corresponding to the IDH, the diversity of these groups explained peak richness at intermediate intervals after the disturbance. In line with the IDH, species richness showed a hump-backed temporal course for alpha and gamma diversity. We found evidence for a linear succession directly after the disturbance. This, however, did not continue, and in all species groups, a partial recovery of the initial community was observed. In the case of fungi, herbs, and trees, but not for saproxylic beetles, alpha diversity was driven by the diversity of the successional model types. Our results underline that the mechanisms driving species richness after disturbances are more complex than the IDH suggests and that these mechanisms vary with species group. We assumed that, besides competition, legacy effects, facilitation, habitat heterogeneity, and random saturation of the species pool are important. In case of trees and herbs, we found indications for strong legacy and competition effects. For fungi and beetles, substrate heterogeneity and microclimate were assumed to be important. We concluded that disturbances contribute to increasing species richness not only by reducing the effectiveness of competitors but also by increasing the amount and diversity of resources, as well as their rate of change over time.

AB  - Respiration plays a key role in the terrestrial carbon cycle and is a fundamental metabolic process in all plant tissues and cells. We review respiration from the perspective of plants that grow in their natural habitat and how it is influenced by wide-ranging elements at different scales, from metabolic substrate availability to shifts in climate. Decades of field-based measurements have honed our understanding of the biological and environmental controls on leaf, root, stem, and whole-organism respiration. Despite this effort, there remain gaps in our knowledge within and across species and ecosystems, especially in more challenging-to-measure tissues like roots. Recent databases of respiration rates and associated leaf traits from species representing diverse biomes, plant functional types, and regional climates have allowed for a wider-lens view at modeling this important CO2 flux. We also re-analyze published data sets to show that maximum leaf respiration rates (R-max) in species from around the globe are related both to leaf economic traits and environmental variables (precipitation and air temperature), but that root respiration does not follow the same latitudinal trends previously published for leaf data. We encourage the ecophysiological community to continue to expand their study of plant respiration in tissues that are difficult to measure and at the whole plant and ecosystem levels to address outstanding questions in the field.

AB  - Increasingly, fast-growing forest plantations are able to support the wood supply but may simultaneously reduce water availability. The trade-off between wood production and water supply is more evident in areas with low water availability, high seasonal variation, or high water demand from local communities. The management regime adopted in forest plantations can either increase or reduce this trade-off. Thus, we assess herein the water and wood supply under different fast-growing forest plantation management regimes to understand how forest management practices can balance the provision of these services. The study was conducted at two catchments with a predominance of fast-growing forest plantations, namely, the mosaic management catchment (MMC) and the intensive management catchment (IMC). Rainfall and streamflow were monitored for three water years. Hydrological indexes were calculated to assess the hydrological regime of both catchments, and make inventories of the forest to assess forest growth rates. MMC had streamflow coefficients, baseflow index and baseflow stability higher than those of IMC. Mean annual wood increment was 32.73 m(3) ha (-1) yr(-1) in MMC, with a mean age of 15 years, and 44.40 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1) in IMC at coppice in the second year. MMC hydrological indexes remained stable over the period studied, while in IMC the hydrological indexes were affected by climatic variations, mainly in drier years. MMC showed potential for supplying both water and wood. However, in IMC there was a trade-off between wood supply at the expense of the water supply. Thus, the intensity of fast-growing management can be adjusted to achieve a balance between water and wood supply on a catchment scale.

AB  - Rainfall partitioning is a key process in forest ecosystems, affecting evaporation, transpiration and water storage in the canopy, litter and soil. Although rainfall partitioning has been well studied in forest ecosystems, less is known about how rainfall partitioning is modified by tree species diversity. To disentangle the effects of tree species identity and diversity on rainfall partitioning, we installed 128 rain gauges in an experimental plantation, located in Zedelgem (Belgium), part of a large, multi-site forest diversity experiment in Belgium (FORBIO). With these rain gauges, we monitored throughfall for a full year, with a temporal resolution of two weeks. Based on these data, we analysed identity (i.e. whether throughfall is species-specific), non-additive (i.e. whether throughfall in mixtures is different from the expected amounts based on monocultures) and richness effects (i.e. how species richness affects throughfall). First of all, we found that rainfall partitioning highly differed between tree species, due to pronounced species identity effects. The presence of Pinus sylvestris [pine] was always associated with lower throughfall. Year-round throughfall was, for example, the lowest in mixtures of pine and Tilia cordata [lime] (43.8 +/- 14.5% of the open-field rainfall) and monocultures of pine (48.6 +/- 11.8%). Addi-tionally, non-additive effects were significant, leading to a 10% decrease of rainfall reaching the forest floor in mixtures compared to the expected throughfall based on measurements in monocultures. Tree species richness effects on rainfall partitioning acted indirectly, mostly via an increased basal area in mixed stands. Our findings suggest that mixing tree species leads to a higher than expected reduction in throughfall, which lowered soil moisture in mixed plots. Whether this reduced throughfall and soil moisture affects ecosystem functioning re-mains to be quantified.

AB  - In Mediterranean-climate areas, wildfires have an important ecological role, selecting organisms, influencing species composition and structure of vegetation, and shaping landscapes. However, the increase in frequency and severity of fires can cause, among others, progressive vegetation degradation, biodiversity, and ecosystem services loss. Under the climate change scenario, the frequency and severity of wildfires are expected to increase, especially in the Mediterranean Basin, recognized as among the most affected by the intensification of droughts and heat waves in the future. Therefore, from the perspective of adaptation, it is important not only to assess the sudden effects after a fire but also to investigate the ecological changes and vegetation response over time. In this framework, this study investigates the effects and the short-term vegetation response in an area struck by a megafire. The vegetation response one year after a fire has been assessed in semi-natural grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands at the landscape scale through spectral indices, and at the field scale through floristic and vegetation surveys. Our results showed that after a severe wildfire, although some areas did not exhibit vegetation regrowth, the response of natural vegetation was notable after one year. In the study area, the most resilient vegetation type was semi-natural grasslands, suggesting that this type of vegetation can be crucial for landscape recovery. The other vegetation types showed different response patterns that also prefigure possible changes in species composition and loss of plant diversity over the medium term. This study highlights the value of combining remote sensing spectral analyses and detailed floristic and vegetation surveys for understanding the direction of the early stages of post-fire vegetation dynamics.

AB  - In Hong Kong, as in many tropical areas, grasslands are maintained by fire on disturbed and abandoned land. However, Hong Kong's native forests are regenerating in many areas, alongside frequent burning of the hillsides, and are in different stages of structural succession to closed canopy forest patches. Understanding the major determinants of secondary succession is a vital input to forest management policies. Given the importance of forests for biodiversity conservation, watershed protection and carbon cycling. This study examines the relationship between burning regimes and structural forest succession over 42 years from 1973 to 2015, using an archive of satellite images, aerial photographs and field plot data. Overlay of a fire frequency map with maps of forest structural classes at different dates indicates the number of fires undergone by each successional class as well as the time taken to progress from one class to another under different fire regimes. Results indicate that the native sub-tropical evergreen forests, which are naturally fire intolerant, can regenerate alongside moderate burning, and once the shrub stage is reached, succession to closed forest is relatively rapid and can occur within 13 years. More than one burn, however, is more destructive, and twice-burnt areas were seen to have only one-third of the woody biomass of once-burnt plots. The most frequent fires occurred in areas where mono-cultural plantations had been destroyed by disease in the 1960s and were subsequently invaded by grasslands. These former plantation areas remained in early successional stages of grass and open shrubland by 2015. Other plantations from the 1970s and 1980s remain as plantations today and have acted as a barrier to natural forest succession, attesting to the greater effectiveness of fire control over re-afforestation measures.

AB  - Mass outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, have caused devastating damage to Norway spruce-dominated forests in Central Europe. Biotic and abiotic natural disturbances as well as logging activities promote the fragmentation of forest stands, further increasing their susceptibility to damaging events. The creation of forest edges abruptly alters microclimatic conditions, such as trees suddenly being exposed to the sun. A common hypothesis is that trees remaining at the margins of clear cuts are initiation spots for spruce bark beetle infestation. This study comprehensively investigates the direct effects of forest edge establishment in spring on air and bark temperatures, soil water potential, tree sap flow, resin flow, bark defence compounds, and olfactometric cues for bark beetles provided by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in proximity to trees. Ips typographus host acceptance was tested in limited-choice (attack box) and non-choice (Eppendorf tubes) field bioassays.
   Bark surface temperatures and resin flow clearly increased in trees of the freshly cut forest edges in spring, while sap flow rates did not differ from those of shaded trees in the inner forest. Soil water potential was high throughout the study season owing to sufficient precipitation and decreased only in August. Contrary to similar amounts of monoterpenes in the phloem of inner forest and edge trees, VOC concentrations were enhanced in May and June at the forest margin, also due to the presence of fresh logging residuals. The increased bark surface temperatures and VOC concentrations near forest edge trees were observed simultaneously with enhanced moving activity of I. typographus in the attack box bioassays soon after edge establishment in May. The effectiveness of increased resin flow in spring as a contributor to defence of edge trees could not be evaluated in the attack box bioassays, as boring holes at both edge and inner forest trees were observed, mainly later in the season. We conclude that fresh forest edges are not more susceptible to I. typographus attack shortly after establishment than closed forest stands but that microclimatic conditions of forest margins and olfactory signals from standing edge trees and logging residuals favour beetle swarming. Spruce bark beetle infestation patterns in fragmented forests are likely dependent on population densities and timing of predisposing abiotic disturbance and harvesting events.

AB  - 1. Soil organic matter (SOM) is the largest actively cycling reservoir of terrestrial carbon (C), and the majority of SOM in Earth's mineral soils (-65%) is mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM). Thus, the formation and fate of MAOM can exert substantial influence on the global C cycle. To predict future changes to Earth's climate, it is critical to mechanistically understand the processes by which MAOM is formed and decomposed, and to accurately represent this process-based understanding in biogeochemical and Earth system models.
   2. In this review, we use a trait-based framework to synthesize the interacting roles of plants, soil micro-organisms, and the mineral matrix in regulating MAOM formation and decomposition. Our proposed framework differentiates between plant and microbial traits that influence total OM inputs to the soil ('feedstock traits') versus traits that influence the proportion of OM inputs that are ultimately incorporated into MAOM ('MAOM formation traits'). We discuss how these feedstock and MAOM formation traits may be altered by warming, altered precipitation and elevated carbon dioxide.
   3. At a planetary scale, these feedstock and MAOM formation traits help shape the distribution of MAOM across Earth's biomes, and modulate biome-specific responses of MAOM to climate change. We leverage a global synthesis of MAOM measurements to provide estimates of the total amount of MAOM-C globally (similar to 840-1540 Pg C; 34%-51% of total terrestrial organic C), and its distribution across Earth's biomes. We show that MAOM-C concentration is highest in temperate forests and grasslands, and lowest in shrublands and savannas. Grasslands and croplands have the highest proportion of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the MAOM fraction (i.e. the MAOM-C:SOC ratio), while boreal forests and tundra have the lowest MAOM-C:SOC ratio. Drawing on our trait framework, we then review experimental data and posit the effects of climate change on MAOM pools in different biomes.
   4. We conclude by discussing how MAOM is integrated into soil C models, and how feedstock and MAOM formation traits may be included in these models. We also summarize the projected fate of MAOM under climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5) and discuss key model uncertainties.

AB  - Riparian areas in the Cantabrian Atlantic ecoregion (northwest Portugal) play a key role in soil formation and conservation, regulation of nutrient and water cycle, creation of landscape aesthetic value and the preservation of biodiversity. The maintenance of their ecological integrity is crucial given the ever increase in multiple anthropogenic (water demand and agriculture) and climatic pressures (droughts and extreme events). We developed a transferable remote sensing approach, taking advantage of the latest freely available technologies (Sentinel-2 and Copernicus Land products), to detect intra-annual and inter-annual changes in riparian vegetation productivity at the river basin scale related to water stress. This study has used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate riparian vegetation productivity dynamics on three different vegetation types (coniferous, broadleaved and grassland) over the past 5 years (2015-2019). Our results indicated that inter-annual seasonality differed between drier (2017) and wetter (2016) years. We found that intra-annual dynamics of NDVI were influenced by the longitudinal river zonation. Our model ranked first (r(2)m 0.73) showed that the productivity of riparian vegetation during the dry season was positively influenced by annual rainfall and by the type of riparian vegetation. The emergent long lags between climatic variation and riparian plant productivity provides opportunities to forecast early warnings of climatically-driven impacts. In addition, the different average productivity levels among vegetation types should be considered when assessing climatic impacts on riparian vegetation. Future applications of Sentinel 2 products could seek to distinguish riparian areas that are likely to be more vulnerable to changes in the annual water balance from those that are more resistant under longer-term changes in climate.

AB  - In this work, we theoretically explore how litter decomposition processes and soil-borne pathogens contribute to negative plant-soil feedbacks, in particular in transient and stable spatial organisation of tropical forest trees and seedlings known as Janzen-Connell distributions. By considering soil-borne pathogens and autotoxicity both separately and in combination in a phenomenological model, we can study how both factors may affect transient dynamics and emerging Janzen-Connell distributions. We also identify parameter regimes associated with different long-term behaviours. Moreover, we compare how the strength of negative plant-soil feedbacks was mediated by tree germination and growth strategies, using a combination of analytical approaches and numerical simulations. Our interdisciplinary investigation, motivated by an ecological question, allows us to construct important links between local feedbacks, spatial self-organisation, and community assembly. Our model analyses contribute to understanding the drivers of biodiversity in tropical ecosystems, by disentangling the abilities of two potential mechanisms to generate Janzen-Connell distributions. Furthermore, our theoretical results may help guiding future field data analyses by identifying spatial signatures in adult tree and seedling distribution data that may reflect the presence of particular plant-soil feedback mechanisms.

AB  - The assessment of the conservation status of urban forest remnants is essential for sustaining tree diversity in metropolitan cities. This study evaluated the composition and structure of forest remnants in four urban parks within the natural distribution of Montane Mixed Ombrophilous Forest in Curitiba (PR, Brazil). We allocated 66 plots of 100 m(2) and recorded all trees with perimeters at breast height >= 15 cm. A total of 1256 individuals from 44 botanical families and 117 tree species were identified, of which three are alien species. Tree density ranged from 1670 to 2095 trees ha(-1), while the density of standing dead trees varied between 90 and 188 trees ha(-1). We experienced values for the Shannon diversity index between 3.00 and 3.52 nats ind(-1), which are comparable to the values for other non-urban forest remnants. Non-pioneer species represented 84.6% of the tree community (99 spp.), and 76% were zoochoric species (89 spp.). The research findings feed the discussion on the need of specific and integrated measures for the management of the urban parks reserved to the conservation of tree diversity in a specific phytoecological formation, while considering aspects of climate change and historical anthropisation.

AB  - Soil seed banks are reservoirs of plant biodiversity. Here the authors compile a global dataset of soil seed banks in natural plant communities and report a spatially explicit analysis of environmental controls of seed bank density and diversity.
   Soil seed banks represent a critical but hidden stock for potential future plant diversity on Earth. Here we compiled and analyzed a global dataset consisting of 15,698 records of species diversity and density for soil seed banks in natural plant communities worldwide to quantify their environmental determinants and global patterns. Random forest models showed that absolute latitude was an important predictor for diversity of soil seed banks. Further, climate and soil were the major determinants of seed bank diversity, while net primary productivity and soil characteristics were the main predictors of seed bank density. Moreover, global mapping revealed clear spatial patterns for soil seed banks worldwide; for instance, low densities may render currently species-rich low latitude biomes (such as tropical rain-forests) less resilient to major disturbances. Our assessment provides quantitative evidence of how environmental conditions shape the distribution of soil seed banks, which enables a more accurate prediction of the resilience and vulnerabilities of plant communities and biomes under global changes.

AB  - Variables describing the abiotic environment (e.g. climate, topography or biogeographic history) have a long tradition of use as predictors of tree species richness patterns. However, these variables may capture variations in richness related to climate, but not those that are related to soil type or forest disturbance. Canopy structure has previously been shown to provide information on the variation of tree species richness, with richness generally increasing with larger canopy heights and denser foliage. The use of canopy structure is increasingly relevant with the availability of such data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), a lidar mission onboard the International Space Station. In this analysis we show that GEDI canopy structure explains up to 66% of the variation in tree species richness in natural forests without a history of recent disturbance across the globe. However, this portion overlaps with the variation (up to 80%) explained by environmental and biogeographical variables. Our results show that relationships between tree species richness on one side and climate and canopy structure on the other side are not as straightforward as we initially expected, and should be further investigated across both natural and disturbed forests.

AB  - Well-managed rangelands provide important economic, environmental, and cultural benefits. Yet, many rangelands worldwide are experiencing pressures of land-use change, overgrazing, fire, and drought, causing rapid degradation. These pressures are especially acute in the Hawaiian Islands, which we explore as a microcosm with some broadly relevant lessons. Absent stewardship, land in Hawaii is typically subject to degradation through the spread and impacts of noxious invasive plant species; feral pigs, goats, deer, sheep, and cattle; and heightened fire risk. We first provide a framework, and then review the science demonstrating the benefits of well-managed rangelands, for production of food; livelihoods; watershed services; climate security; soil health; fire risk reduction; biodiversity; and a wide array of cultural values. Findings suggest that rangelands, as part of a landscape mosaic, contribute to social and ecological health and well-being in Hawaii. We conclude by identifying important knowledge gaps around rangeland ecosystem services and highlight the need to recognize rangelands and their stewards as critical partners in achieving key sustainability goals, and in bridging the long-standing production-conservation divide.

AB  - The Polylepis forests in the central Andes of Peru remain in hostile environments due to their location above 4000 meters of altitude. They are home to a great biodiversity with a high level of endemism and are extremely vulnerable to climate change and human pressure. Variations in rainfall and temperature have been affecting plant health. These aspects have led to the analysis of the physiological response of plants through water stress and NDVI, in dry periods and related to altitudinal gradients and slope, of five forests located in the regions of Junin and Lima, where the species Polylepis rodolfo vasquezii, P. canoi and P. flavilpila are found. Seven 15 x 21 m plots and 10 sub-plots were established, distributed in the lower, middle and upper parts of the forest. The water potential of leaflets was measured by a Scholander pressure pump in a Pascale unit, microclimate variations by means of installed soil and air humidity and temperature sensors; the NDVI by means of multispectral images captured by an unmanned airborne vehicle. Water stress was different among species and changed according to the altitudinal gradient, soil hydrological variation and temperature. Leaflet size adaptation related to stress changes and a high correlation of NDVI with plant stress status were observed.

AB  - Cecil Charter had taught botany and biology in China and Antigua for five years, when in 1931 he was engaged to conduct a soil survey of the sugarcane-growing areas of Antigua. This was followed by similar surveys elsewhere in the Caribbean. In 1944, he joined the West African Cacao Research Institute in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) to carry out soil investigations in the forest zones of West Africa. In 1949 he moved to organise the soil survey unit in the Gold Coast Department of Agriculture, and, in 1951, to found and direct the new Soil and Land Use Survey Department. He rapidly built up a highly professional unit that produced many practical and useful reports of high quality. He based the surveys on ecological principles, selecting river basins as mapping regions. In the initial absence of qualified soil scientists, he subdivided the soil survey process and trained school leavers as technicians for separate tasks. Teams of these technicians examined soils, vegetation and land use at regular intervals on regularly-spaced traverses cut across the topography. Charter's contributions to soil science included his recognition of non-residual tropical soils formed in material brought to the surface by soil fauna and treefall. Also, he differentiated between highly acidic upland Oxysols in high-rainfall areas, which he considered unsuitable for cocoa cultivation, and less acidic Ochrosols, which were more suitable. Based on farmers' experience and his ecological background, he differentiated between forest, thicket and savannah soils within these groups. He strongly advocated genetic and contextual classification of tropical soils.

AB  - Deadwood provides important ecological and biogeochemical functions in forest ecosystems. These functions rely on tree species-specific decay dynamics, but only few studies investigated how exogenous parameters affected the decay of deadwood at the regional scale. Here, we explore the influence of climate, soil traits and forest structure on decay dynamics and mass loss of logs of 13 tree species in 29 plots across three regions in Germany. This long-term experiment (BELongDead) comprises 1,066 logs of 9 angiosperms and 4 gymnosperms and covers a decay time of almost 10 years. Mass loss of logs was relatively high for the temperate climate with partly different half-lives ranging from 6 to 13 years (mean 8.9 +/- 2.2 years). Diffuse-porous angiosperms lost 70 +/- 13 % of their initial mass, followed by gymnosperms (49 +/- 16 %) and ring-porous angiosperms (46 +/- 12 %) within the study period. We applied three different mathematical models to fit mass loss in time and found that a linear model is most appropriate for 10 tree species. A sigmoidal model best described the mass loss of Fraxinus, Quercus and Pinus logs. A multivariate analysis revealed a significant effect of soil, temperature and precipitation on mass loss at the plot level. Mass loss increased with decreasing soil nutrient content, possibly as a result of enhanced bidirectional element translocations between nutrient-poor soils and logs by fungal hyphae. Temperature had a positive effect on mass loss, whereas increasing precipitation and soil moisture were negatively related to mass loss. The region with warmer, moderately humid climate and unfavourable soil properties led to overall higher mass loss (66 +/- 4 %) whereas the other two regions were indifferent (both 57 +/- 3 %). Forest structure, including canopy cover, share of coniferous trees and the stock of deadwood in the vicinity of the logs explained only a small part of the variability in mass loss. High variability within individual tree species suggests that other factors such as organismic diversity and microbial activity have stronger impact on the decay process at the regional scale than exogenous factors.

AB  - During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 30 to 16.5 ka ago), the Great Adriatic-Po Region (GAPR) was deeply affected by the spread of glaciers from the Alps to the southern foreland and by the dropping of the sea level to similar to -120 m amsl. The combination of these two events triggered the aggradation of the Great Po Plain (GPP), a vast flat area between the Alpine chain, the Italian Peninsula and the north-western Balkan Peninsula, physically and ecologically featured through a range of palaeogeographic and palaeoecological conditions. The low-elevated Prealpine sectors and the Alpine foothills supported more extensive forest stands, due to increased omgraphic rainfall. These were open boreal forests which persisted throughout the LGM, while open woodlands, steppes, semideserts and wetlands occupied the lowlands. A complex ecogradient, including both an Alpine and a continental timberline, is documented by the fossil records at the NE Alpine border, with a larch-pine forest-steppe belt, in contact with steppes and loess areas extending in the plain, on the dry extreme of the gradient. Still, edaphic wetlands occupied the waterlogged silty soils in the lowlands. Other areas, marked by active geodynamic processes, supported semideserts, i.e. grooves of xerophytic herbs and shrubs. Enhanced aridity and the development of deflation areas, prompted the accretion of loess cover at the northern and southern margins of the GPP. Fauna recorded the gradual disappearance of mammoth, woolly rhino and giant deer, together with cave bear. Gravettian and Epigravettian hunter-gatherer groups inhabited the GPP, although their presence and settlement dynamics at the margins and across this region has long been questioned. As a matter of fact, a handful of archaeological sites composes a patchy record of the peopling of the plain itself. At the northern rim of the GAPR, characterized by a well-developed karst region, several caves and rock shelters record the presence of hunters of bisons and horses at the margins of the GPP and ibexes and cave bears in some hilly landscapes. Nonetheless, evidence of contacts across this area is provided by the exploitation of chert sources and by stylistic and technical similarities in the lithic industries. The work resumes the currently available multidisciplinary data and adds new petroarchaeological evidence for reconstructing the settlement dynamics of the Gravettian - Epigravettian hunter-gatherers in this vast region up to the early Late Glacial, when the Prealpine and the Apennine foothills, along with the Dinarids, were persistently settled.

AB  - The research on activities of Cs-137 and K-40, which was conducted on the silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) from Lika has included sampling of the trees in the field (rings of the bole from three different heights separated into bark, growth rings, roots, needles, shoots, and the soil surrounding the cut down trees), laboratory analysis of samples using the gamma-ray spectrometry and the statistical analysis of the collected data. The radial and vertical distribution of cesium (Cs-137) in trees was investigated. Cs-137 has contaminated forest ecosystems by remote atmospheric transport and radioactive precipitation as a result of nuclear test including the nuclear accident in Chernobyl. On a longer time scale, the variability of the Cs-137 distribution determined in the organisms of the silver fir depended on the half-life, while the seasonal dynamics were influenced by the degree of physiological activity and the characteristics and functions of plant tissues. The highest activity of Cs-137 was determined in the bark and the physiologically most active parts of the silver fir (shoots and needles). The highest activity concentration of the Cs-137 in the growth rings was measured in the lowest parts of the silver fir trees. This research contributed to understanding the behavior of Cs-137, which entered the organisms of dominant tree species in the forest ecosystem, as well as its distribution in time and space.

AB  - There is no consensus on the cause of decline in conifer diversity across the K/Pg boundary, particularly in relation to the evolution and modernization of the tropical rainforest biome and the global rise of angiosperm diversity. In order to elucidate this issue, the pattern of conifer turnover across the K/Pg boundary in the Raton and Denver basins is revisited in light of additional fieldwork and improved chronostratigraphy. Turnover between the late Maastrichtian tropical evergreen climax conifer assemblage and the early Paleocene pioneer swamp cypress assemblage was stratigraphically abrupt, occurring within +/- 1-2 m of the K/Pg boundary. As the swamp cypress Glyptostrobus is known to be intolerant of competition, its persistence through the P1 Zone (lowest Danian palynological zone, which represents the first-400 ky of the Danian) in relatively stable, peat-forming depositional settings in Colorado is interpreted as evidence of arrested succession associated with the extinction of the tropical evergreen climax community. Although this basic pattern has historically been attributed to selection for deciduousness across the K/Pg boundary, this investigation highlights the related fact that tropical evergreen araucarian conifers and other trees in tropical evergreen climax forests characteristically do not produce soil seed banks, particularly as the archaic climax conifers that not only crossed the boundary but which also thrived in tropical, drought-prone settings are known to exhibit seed dormancy (e.g., Cheirolepidiaceae). As these findings parallel those of recent paleobotanical investigations in South America (Colombia and Patagonia, Argentina), this fundamental turnover pattern is regarded to be a global phenomenon underpinned by a unifying causal factor that is, a relatively severe K/Pg asteroid impact winter with global effects. Other popular but more controversial turnover hypotheses, such as the concept that conifers and other gymnosperms exhibit lower propensity for polyploidization- driven diversification than angiosperms, are also critically reconsidered in light of new and emerging evidence.

AB  - Conservation tillage (CT) is of primary importance in food security, soil conservation, and sustainable development, even though its comprehensive effects on runoff (RO) and soil loss (SL) are still not fully understood. In 2004, a field-scale study was launched in southwest Hungary to investigate the long-term (16 years) effects of CT on RO, SL and soil, under a warm-summer humid continental climate. Four, especially large, 1200 m(2) plots (2 ploughing tillage (PT) and 2 CT) were established, using a special, two-channel collection system. By the end of the study period, significantly higher water-stable aggregates (PT: 20.0 %, CT: 30.4 %), higher soil organic matter (PT: 1.4 %, CT: 1.9 %), greater earthworm abundance (4.9 times that in PT plots) was recorded on the CT plots. Conservation tillage decreased surface RO by 75 % and SL by 95 %. The difference between PT and CT was significant for mean annual soil erosion, with values of 2.8 t ha(-1) and 0.2 t ha(-1), respectively. The exceedance of extreme precipitation events was <2%, but their impact on soil erosion was extraordinarily high. Runoff and SL were predicted for the whole dataset, and for the sub-dataset of maize culture, in four separate Random Forest (RF) model developments. The often used linear models are not suitable for predicting soil erosion, hence a more robust, non-parametric, advanced method of classification tree analysis was used. The RF classification method was able to predict erosion risk. For the maize sub-dataset, the RF model best predicted the extreme events, followed by the no-runoff category. The sensitivity of the groups with the highest and lowest risk all exceeded 82 % for SL and 64 % for RO. Tillage type was the most important factor. This long-term study demonstrated that the use of CT enabled the maintenance of a major fraction of precipitation on arable land, and consequently, soil loss remained an order of magnitude lower than its tolerable value. The RF method is suitable for modelling RO and SL. In future, the integration of more datasets in modelling would considerably improve the precision and accuracy of prediction of RO and SL.

AB  - Accurately identifying entomopathogenic fungi is crucially important, but the current approach of analysing four genes might not provide sufficient resolution. In this study, we investigated the different resolution provided by multilocus phylogenies and approaches based on whole genome sequence data. Fungi were isolated from soil samples that were collected from five different vegetation types (dry sclerophyll forest, agricultural grassland, rainforest, suburban parkland, and sugar cane fields) and across four different suburban soil habitat types in southeast Queensland. Three different agricultural pests were used as live baits, cotton stainer bug, diamondback moth, and rust-red flour beetle. Whole-genome sequencing was conducted for all 83 isolates recovered, and the ITS2 region was extracted from the genome assemblies to make initial species identifications with the UNITE database. We also extracted tef1a 3 ', tef1a 5', rpb1 and rpb2 genes from the Metarhizium genomes and the bloc, tef1a and rpb1 genes from Beauveria genomes to construct multilocus phylogenies and obtain species identification. To investigate the genetic relationships across 14 isolates of Beauveria bassiana and (independently) across 43 isolates of Metarhizium based on whole-genome data, we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and conducted principal components analysis on the whole-genome SNP data. The multilocus methods identified isolates to species more precisely than ITS2, except in the one unresolved clade in the Met-arhizium phylogeny. The whole-genome approach identified more genetic clusters than the multilocus phylog-enies identified species among the isolates, and the morphological results correlated with some of the genetic clusters, so they likely represent distinct species not detected by the other methods. The genetic clusters were not associated with vegetation type or bait insect species. This is the first comparison of the resolution of multilocus phylogenetics with that of whole-genome SNP data for these genera. We suggest how the genetic clusters identified here may be investigated further to determine whether they represent unrecognised species within these groups.

AB  - Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of droughts. These events, which can cause significant perturbations of terrestrial ecosystems and potentially long-term impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning after the drought has subsided are often called 'drought legacies'. While the immediate effects of drought on ecosystems have been comparatively well characterized, our broader understanding of drought legacies is just emerging. Drought legacies can relate to all aspects of ecosystem structure and functioning, involving changes at the species and the community scale as well as alterations of soil properties. This has consequences for ecosystem responses to subsequent drought. Here, we synthesize current knowledge on drought legacies and the underlying mechanisms. We highlight the relevance of legacy duration to different ecosystem processes using examples of carbon cycling and community composition. We present hypotheses characterizing how intrinsic (i.e. biotic and abiotic properties and processes) and extrinsic (i.e. drought timing, severity, and frequency) factors could alter resilience trajectories under scenarios of recurrent drought events. We propose ways for improving our understanding of drought legacies and their implications for subsequent drought events, needed to assess the longer-term consequences of droughts on ecosystem structure and functioning.

AB  - Citrus greening is one of the world's most serious diseases of citrus that affects all cultivars and causes the systematic death of trees worldwide. The disease is caused mostly by the bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter species. The wind, rain, and touch of infected workers cannot transmit this infectious disease. The Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP), a minuscule insect, is one of the main vectors that transmit the disease by feeding on citrus leaves. Citrus greening management is also quite expensive since no successful treatment for the cure has been found, except to remove all affected vegetables from healthy crops to eliminate the bacterial spread. Citrus greening is also the most challenging task, as signs of other citrus diseases and nutritional deficiencies are identical. The major signs of this disease are asymmetrical, blotchy mottling patterns on leaves. Here, several visible indications of citrus greening were addressed, which will enable farmers at the root level to detect and avoid this condition prior to its having a dramatic influence on citrus plantations. We also talked about the pen test method to determine symptoms as symmetrical or asymmetrical throughout the mid-vine, regardless of whether they are impacted by citrus greening or lack of nutrients.

AB  - Land-use/land-cover (LULC) change could have huge impacts on a wide range of ecosystem services, such as the quality, types, processes, temporal, and spatial patterns of ecosystem, leading to dramatic changes in different types of ecosystem services. China has implemented Grain-for-Green Programme (GFGP) to alleviate soil erosion, restore and improve ecosystem services. We selected Jinghe River basin, one of the main GFGP pilot areas in the central part of the Loess Plateau in China as study area. InVEST models were adopted to quantify three of the most important ecosystem services (water yield, sediment control and carbon storage) from 2000 to 2015, during which an important GFGP process happens. Results showed that compared with 2000, the area of farmland decreased by 466 km(2), the area of degraded grassland decreased by 394 km(2), while the area of forestland increased by 339 km(2) (including shrub land) in Jinghe River basin. The average annual water yield and sediment export from 2000 to 2015 is 1.11 x 10(9) m(3) and 9.67 x 10(7) t, which is 36.2% and 60.7% lower than the average of the previous 50 years. Unsurprisingly, carbon storage has increased 5907559.28 mg, about 2.4% more compared to 2000. There are trade-offs between water yield and sediment control as well as carbon storage, and there are synergies between sediment control and carbon storage. Our quantitative assessment has revealed the complex spatial and temporal trade-offs and synergies among competing ecosystem services during the GFGP process. In addition, the results of t-tests in the sub-basin showed that the water yield and sediment control of grassland restoration area and forestland restoration area are better than those of farmland. The water yield of grassland restoration area is better than that of forestland restoration area. But it is difficult to judge the sediment export in forestland restoration area and grassland restoration area. Therefore, considering the trade-offs between water yield and sediment control, grasses are better vegetation type of GFGP compared to trees for the Loess Plateau which has relatively limited precipitation. Our results showed that the control of the erosion by adding vegetation triggers to a diminution of water yield, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. Decision making regards to future GFGP and ecological restoration projects should consider the complex and competing trade-offs and synergies in a wide range of ecosystem services, and optimize the planting structure and scale of vegetation in order to achieve long-term, secure, and sustainable provision of vital ecosystem services.

AB  - As a result of canopy interception and transpiration, trees are often assumed to have negative effects on the local hydrological budget resulting in reduced soil and groundwater resources. However, it has also been shown that trees can have positive effects through reducing surface run-off and improving soil infiltrability and groundwater recharge, especially in many tropical ecosystems characterized by high rain intensity and degradation-prone soils. In this study, we used isotopic measurements of soil water to better understand the main processes by which trees influence local soil water dynamics within a tropical pasture with scattered tree cover in the Copan River catchment, Honduras. We also determined the stable isotope signature of xylem water in grasses and trees to assess potential competition for water sources during the wet and dry seasons. During the wet season, when soil water availability was not limiting, both grasses and trees primarily utilized soil water near the soil surface (i.e., 0-10 cm). In contrast, during the dry season, we observed niche partitioning for water resources where grasses primarily utilized soil moisture at deeper soil depth (i.e., 90-100 cm) while trees relied heavily on groundwater. Moreover, isotopic data of soil water suggest that trees reduce evaporative water losses from the soil surface, as indicated by the lack of correlation between soil water content and lc-excess (line condition excess) values of surface soil water under trees, and enhance preferential flow as suggested by less negative lc-excess values under trees compared to open areas during the dry season. Taken together, our findings provide further support that trees can have positive effects on the local water balance with implication for landscape management, promoting the inclusion of scattered trees to provide water ecosystem services in silvopastoral systems, adding to other ecosystem services like biodiversity or carbon sequestration.

AB  - Rapid and accurate surveys of land are essential for protecting ecosystems. This study aimed to survey the spatial-temporal land degradation patterns and explore its driving mechanism based on a geographical detector in Hainan Island from 2000 to 2020. First, the areas of forest, cultivated land, and construction land were analysed, and their mutation year was determined through the Mann-Kendall abrupt test. Then, change vector analysis was used to create a double-evaluation system by combining the normalized difference vegetation index and net primary productivity. Finally, the geographical detector was used to identify the driving mechanism of different land-use types. The results show that 2013 was the mutation year of the three land-use types. From 2000 to 2013 (Stage 1), the land degradation areas of forest, cultivated land, construction land, grassland, and unutilised land reached 1977.13, 613.25, 165.81, 261.06, and 4.25 km2, respectively. From 2013 to 2020 (Stage 2), the degraded land area accounted for only 0.91 % of the island's total area. From the single factor perspective, the elevation (DEM), least distance to residential area (LDP), and variety of mean annual temperature (VTem) were found to be the dominant factors of land degradation of cultivated land and grassland, forest, construction land in Stage 1. On the other hand, in Stage 2, the main factor of land degradation was the variety of the density of GDP (VGDP) in cultivated land, grassland, and construction land, while it was the variety of mean annual precipitation (VPre) in the forest. Moreover, all pair-factors provided a higher determinant power for degraded land areas than a single factor. From the interaction effect perspective in Stage 1, VPOP n LDR (i.e. the variety of the density of population density and least distance to roads or railways), LDP n LDR, and VTem n LDR were the most significant pair-factors of the interaction effect on land degradation of cultivated land, forest and grassland, and construction land. In Stage 2, the most significant pair-factors of the interaction effect in different land-use types were DEM n VPOP and VPre n POP in degraded cultivated land, VPre n DEM and VPre n LDR in degraded forest land, DEM n VTem in degraded grassland, and VGDP n LDR in degraded construction land. Given the timelag effects of factors and the attribution analysis of land degradation, we suggest limiting the construction of roads and residential areas, increasing biodiversity, and sheltering forests to protect terrestrial ecosystems in the future.

AB  - Background and aims Plants in severely phosphorus (P)-impoverished environments in southwest Australia are highly P efficient. In a Eucalyptus patens forest on P-impoverished soils in this region, leaf P concentrations ([P]) are very low in common species, which release carboxylates to acquire P. We hypothesised that these species exhibit a high photosynthetic P-use efficiency (PPUE). Being mycorrhizal and releasing carboxylates, the eucalypts would be very strong competitors, also against N-2-fixing neighbours. Therefore, we hypothesised that the dominant species show relatively low leaf nitrogen concentrations ([N]) and a high photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE). Conversely, we expected these species to have a low intrinsic water-use efficiency (iWUE). We also tested the hypothesis that E. patens would not show P-toxicity symptoms at high P availability, and its carboxylate release would not decline at high P supply.Methods We selected common species such as Eucalyptus patens, E. marginata, Corymbia calophylla, Banksia grandis and Bossiaea aquifolium. We analysed their leaf [P], [N], photosynthesis rates, stomatal conductance, PPUE, PNUE, delta C-13, WUE and iWUE. We grew E. patens seedlings in nutrient solution with increasing P supply and measured their carboxylate-exudation rates to test if it declined at high P supply.Results Eucalyptus patens released large amounts of carboxylates without a decrease in carboxylate release with increasing P supply. Eucalyptus patens and co-occurring common species had similarly low leaf [P] and [N], high PPUE and PNUE, but low WUE and iWUE, when compared with literature values.Conclusions The low leaf [N] of dominant species was compensated for by high stomatal conductance. This strategy would be viable only in habitats with abundant water. Therefore, P-efficient water-inefficient species would be restricted in their distribution to habitats with high water availability and not be 'Darwinian demons'.

AB  - Global demand for vegetable oil and high oil palm yield have driven the rapid expansion of oil palm plantations in tropical countries. The research literature widely recognizes the effects of forest cover conversion into oil palm on biodiversity, deforestation, and carbon dynamics. However, research on the ecohydrological impacts of oil palm plantations is sparse, despite studies indicating that oil palm development may reshape land-water interactions and the availability and movement of water at different spatial and temporal scales. We address this gap by conducting a systematic literature review on oil palm development and its relation to ecohydrological processes. We found 139 relevant papers up to the year 2021, addressing different ecohydrological processes related to oil palm. We reviewed their spatiotemporal scales, geographic distribution, oil palm species and age, and the effects of land conversion from forest, cropland, and pastures. We also incorporated societal aspects regarding community perceptions of water. Our review highlights the effects of oil palm plantations on three main components of the water cycle: (i) land-atmosphere, (ii) fluvial systems, and (iii) soils and groundwater. Most studies include analyses of the Indo-Malayan and Australasian biogeographical regions (113), followed by the Neotropics (49) and the Afrotropics (15). Compared to rainforests, oil palm monocultures are warmer and drier. They have higher evapotranspiration (ET) rates, lower runoff regulation and infiltration capacity, and lower soil organic carbon (SOC). Although less often implemented, alternative oil palm management practices, including oil palm agroforestry, can help to mitigate some of these effects. Forest to oil palm conversion is the most studied land transition, while conversions from croplands, pastures, and grasslands are less studied. Overall, we identify gaps in understanding the long-term effects of management on ecohydrological processes under different land conversions, especially in the Neotropics and the Afrotropics, precluding research-informed policy to manage impacts of this expanding crop.

AB  - Natural tropical landscapes have been continuously altered by land use change and other climate factors. Forest management practices have transformed massive tropical forests into rubber plantations throughout mainland Southeast Asia and Southwest China. However, the effect of the forest-to-plantation conversion on ecosystem functions associated with plant litter is limited. Here, we compare litterfall production, decomposition, nutrient return and nutrient use efficiency between a tropical natural forest (TNF) and a monoculture rubber plantation (MRP) in Xishuangbanna (China) over three years. Annual mean litterfall production was significantly higher in TNF (10.92 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) than in MRP (5.23 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)). Production of leaf litter was positively correlated to that of total litterfall, suggesting that leaf litter could be reliably estimated from total litterfall. Temperature and solar radiation are dominant drivers of seasonal variation of litterfall production. The litterfall production was more sensitive to climate variables in MRP. The average stand litter and the decomposition quotient were 1.8 and 1.2 times greater in TNF than in MRP, respectively. The total nutrient return to the forest floor was 2.1 times higher in TNF (5.66 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)) than in MRP (2.76 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)); the return of each mineral element was significantly lower in MRP relative to TNF. The nutrient return preferentially occurred during the cold and dry seasons, which was consistent with the trend of litterfall. Relatively high N, P, Ca, and Mg use efficiencies were observed in MRP in line with their deficiency in the present tropical soils, indicating that rubber trees likely possess an efficient nutrient uptake mechanism to facilitate their adaption to oligotrophic habitats. Our results suggest that the large scale transformation of tropical forests to rubber plantations could alter the biogeochemical cycles related to litterfall, and thus possibly affect the resilience of ecosystems to climate variation. An increasing organic matter input in rubber monoculture may favor the sustainable development of rubber cultivation.

AB  - Soil salinization is the main source of global soil degradation. It has impeded progress towards sustainable development goals (SDGs) by threatening 20% of irrigated areas. However, in many data-poor regions, accurate soil salinization information is unavailable. Thus, an updated soil salinity map with high accuracy and resolution is urgently needed to help local governments conduct precise management. In this study, a bootstrap hybrid machine learning framework was developed combine Sentinel-2 data and environmental covariates. The Boruta algorithm was applied to input the spectral information and environmental variables to identify the primary factors influencing soil salinity. By averaging 100 model iterations within a bootstrap framework, the soil salinity mapping outcomes were compared from four machine learning methods (bagging, classification and regression tree, random forest, and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT)). The results showed that the models driven by spectral information and environmental covariates (strategy II) explained 68~88% of the variability in soil salinity. The model accuracy of strategy II was improved by 5%-8% over that of the models driven only by spectral information (strategy I). The GBRT yielded the most appropriate averaging performance of the four machine learning approaches within strategy II, with an R-2 of 0.88, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.33 dS m(-1) , a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 4.66 and model stability (ROB) of 0.44. The bootstrap averaging method was relatively stable and had high accuracy potential. The distribution of soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake region was the result of a combination of natural and human activity influences. The proposed approach provides a soil salinity mapping strategy with a fine resolution (10 m) and high accuracy in data-poor places. It may also aid in the restoration of biodiversity, the decrease in land degradation, and the avoidance of future food output reductions in the future.

AB  - This study explored the composition of the mycobiome in the rhizosphere of Inga seedlings in two different but neighboring forest ecosystems in the undisturbed tropical Amazon rainforest at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Ecuador. In terra firme plots, which were situated higher up and therefore typically outside of the influence of river floods, and in varzea plots, the lower part of the forest located near the riverbanks and therefore seasonally flooded, tree seedlings of the genus Inga were randomly collected and measured, and the rhizosphere soils surrounding the root systems was collected. Members of the Fabaceae family and the genus Inga were highly abundant in both forest ecosystems. Inga sp. seedlings collected in terra firme showed a lower shoot to root ratio compared to seedlings that were collected in varzea, suggesting that Inga seedlings which germinated in varzea soils could invest more resources in vegetative growth with shorter roots. Results of the physical-chemical properties of soil samples indicated higher proportions of N, Mo, and V in terra firme soils, whereas varzea soils present higher concentrations of all other macro- and micronutrients, which confirmed the nutrient deposition effect of seasonal flooding by the nearby river. ITS metabarcoding was used to explore the mycobiome associated with roots of the genus Inga. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using Qiime 2 to calculate the alpha and beta diversity, species taxonomy and the differential abundance of fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The fungal community represented 75% of the total ITS ASVs, and although present in all samples, the subphylum Glomeromycotina represented 1.42% of all ITS ASVs with annotations to 13 distinct families, including Glomeraceae (72,23%), Gigasporaceae (0,57%), Acaulosporaceae (0,49%). AMF spores of these three AMF families were morphologically identified by microscopy. Results of this study indicate that AMF surround the rhizosphere of Inga seedlings in relatively low proportions compared to other fungal groups but present in both terra firme and varzea Neotropical ecosystems.

AB  - The "hierarchy of factors" hypothesis states that decomposition rates are controlled primarily by climatic, followed by biological and soil variables. Tropical montane forests (TMF) are globally important ecosystems, yet there have been limited efforts to provide a biome-scale characterization of litter decomposition. We designed a common litter decomposition experiment replicated in 23 tropical montane sites across the Americas, Asia, and Africa and combined these results with a previous study of 23 sites in tropical lowland forests (TLF). Specifically, we investigated (1) spatial heterogeneity in decomposition, (2) the relative importance of biological factors that affect leaf and wood decomposition in TMF, and (3) the role of climate in determining leaf litter decomposition rates within and across the TMF and TLF biomes. Litterbags of two mesh sizes containing Laurus nobilis leaves or birchwood popsicle sticks were spatially dispersed and incubated in TMF sites, for 3 and 7 months on the soil surface and at 10-15 cm depth. The within-site replication demonstrated spatial variability in mass loss. Within TMF, litter type was the predominant biological factor influencing decomposition (leaves > wood), with mesh and burial effects playing a minor role. When comparing across TMF and TLF, climate was the predominant control over decomposition, but the Yasso07 global model (based on mean annual temperature and precipitation) only modestly predicted decomposition rate. Differences in controlling factors between biomes suggest that TMF, with their high rates of carbon storage, must be explicitly considered when developing theory and models to elucidate carbon cycling rates in the tropics.

AB  - We show that epilithic biofilms are a relevant nitrogen (N) source in a rocky mountain range in Brazil. During different seasons, we quantified nitrate, ammonium, dissolved organic N (DON) and total dissolved N (TDN) leached by a simulated short rain event. We quantified the epilithic autotrophic biomass by taxonomic groups and its correlation with leached N. We hypothesized that leached N would be correlated to heterocystous cyanobacteria biomass since they are more efficient N2 fixers. We estimated a landscape N supply of 8.5 kg.ha-1.year-1 considering the mean precipitation in the region. TDN in leachate was mainly composed of DON (83.8% +/- 22%), followed by nitrate (12.1% +/- 3%) and ammonium (5% +/- 5%). The autotrophic epilithic community was mainly composed of non-heterocystous (Gloeocapsopsis) and heterocystous cyanobacteria (Scytonema and Stigonema), except for a site more commonly affected by fire events that showed a dominance of Chlorophyta. Biogeochemical upscaling was facilitated by the fact that N leaching was not different among sites or related to autotrophic epilithic biomass or assemblage composition. In conclusion, the capacity of epilithic biofilms to provide N to surrounding systems is an ecosystem service that underscores the necessity to conserve them and their habitats.
   In a Brazilian mountain area, we found that microorganisms on rocks significantly supply nitrogen to the environment during rainfalls. A specific type of bacteria might be the main contributor and, across the landscape, these organisms can provide roughly 8.5 kg of nitrogen per hectare annually. This finding shows that these microorganisms are a consistent and crucial nitrogen source, emphasizing the importance of protecting them and their surroundings.image

AB  - Given accelerated dryland expansion, studies on aridity-driven desertification are of great importance for advancing our understanding of land degradation mechanisms and developing possible mitigation measures. However, the mechanism by which increased aridity drives ecosystems toward desertification and the impacts of aridity on desertification vulnerability both in space and over time remain unclear. Here, we collected eight key ecosystem structure/functioning data (including soil, vegetation, and animal) for threshold identification using piecewise linear models, and then linked them to biome shifts to explore the process of aridity-driven desertification. The results show that ecosystems along aridity index (AI, 1 - precipitation/potential evapotranspiration) gradients experience three vulnerable stages featuring different threshold and biome responses: a low vulnerability stage (AI: 0.5-0.65; mainly featuring a soil fertility loss and a forest decline), a moderate vulnerability stage (AI: 0.65-0.75; mainly featuring accelerated non-forest vegetation degradation) and a high vulnerability stage (AI: 0.75-1; mainly featuring rapid overall land degradation). According to further simulations, areas with low to high vulnerability account for 31% of the global terrestrial area, which is projected to increase by 18.8% (21.2%) by the end of the 21st century under the greenhouse gas emission scenario SSP2-4.5 (SSP3-7.0). Given increased vulnerability and population growth, Africa and East Asia are exposed to great desertification risk and ensuing contradiction between humans and land. These findings can provide a theoretical and practical reference for ecosystem management and policy development, which are critical for dryland ecological security and human welfare in areas threatened by desertification.

AB  - The Ribeirao do Beltrao watershed has an area of 300 km(2), located inside the city of Selviria-MS, is marked by intense changes in the landscape resulting from changes in land use and coverage in the last thirty years. Two rural settlements are installed on the limits of the Ribeirao do Beltrao watershed, Sao Joaquim (35.14 km(2)) and Alecrim (12.7 km(2)). The objective of this work was to evaluate the environmental fragility, taking into account the relationship of variables such as soils, slope, rainfall intensity, priority areas for biodiversity conservation and land use and coverage. The methodological procedures adopted were the weighted overlap of these variables in GIS (Geographic Information System) environment. The results indicated that in the majority of the basin there is an average environmental fragility (45.7%) associated with pasture and forestry areas, with declines between 6% and 12%, followed by low environmental fragility (43.1%), concentrated in places with the presence of natural vegetation; very high (11.1%), correlated to floodplain areas that have complex dynamics and require conservative management, since these areas are found in the vast majority outside the areas of APPs (28.1 km(2)), and high (0.1%), which is incipient in the mapping performed.

AB  - The development stage of forest trees has considerable impact on the understory plant species; however, little research has been dedicated to in-depth investigation of the changes in the ecological processes (deterministic and stochastic) over a mid-term observational period (>= 10 years). We analyzed the forest floor environment, including bare mineral soil, tree communities (density and biomass), understory plant species composition, diversity, cover, and changes in co-occurring species in the Albongbunji Basin on Ulleungdo Island over an 11-year period (2009-2019). The forest floor environment exhibited a broad spectrum of changes, beginning in the middle of the observation period and after heavy rainfall, and heavy sediment deposition events were observed. The overstory tree density showed patterns of a general increase and subsequent decline, and the overstory tree biomass increased and then remained steady. The heavy rainfall and sediment deposition as disturbance events also coincided with changes in species composition and the turnover rate of the understory plant communities, causing changes in major ecological processes. The general pattern of species co-occurrence (zeta diversity) was fitted to an exponential model, indicating the dominance of stochastic processes. The results show a shift in relative importance from deterministic to stochastic processes in the successional stages of understory plant community assembly over a mid-term observational period.

AB  - Monitoring the changes in forest cover has become an important tool for forest management due to its impact on climate change, desertification, soil erosion, and flooding. The Zagros Mountains forest-steppe is a temperate broadleaf and mixed forest ecoregion in Western Asia, and the present study analyzes the changes in Zagros forests from 1986 to 2019 using remote sensing techniques. Three Landsat images, acquired in 1986, 2002, and 2019, were used to map land cover classification in the study area. Classification kappa coefficients were 85.2, 94.1, and 94.7 for three images, respectively. Focusing on the class level, the results show that between 1986 and 2002, the primary cause of forest loss in the study area was the conversion of 7.8 thousand ha of oak forests to agricultural land. Since 2002, 0.8 thousand ha of oak forest cover have been changed to barrenlands. The decrease of Zagros forests is a main threat to the rich biodiversity found in the West of Iran. To avoid worsening soil erosion, restoration programs should prioritize planting patterns on rainfall and hill slopes, texturally dissimilar soils, and regeneration in forest gaps, particularly at high elevations and steep slopes. It is recommended that future research should use higher resolution datasets and encompass more expansive landscape units, such as the whole Zagros Mountain forests.

AB  - Restoration of degraded subtropical succulent thicket, via the planting of Portulacaria afra (spekboom) truncheons, is the focus of a public works programme funded by the South African government. The goals of the programme, which started in 2004, are to create jobs, sequester carbon, restore biodiversity, reduce erosion, improve soil water holding capacity and catalyse private sector investment for upscaling of restoration. Here we report on a region-wide experiment to identify factors that can improve project success. Measures of success were survivorship and annual aboveground biomass carbon sequestration (ABCsr) of spekboom truncheons some 33-57 months after planting-starting in March 2008-into 173 fenced plots (0.25 ha) located throughout the global extent of spekboom thicket vegetation. We also collected data for 18 explanatory variables under the control of managers, and an additional 39 variables reflecting soil physical and chemical characteristics and rainfall patterns post restoration, all beyond the influence of managers. Since the latter covariates were available for only 83 plots, we analysed the two data sets separately. We used a prediction rule ensemble to determine the most important predictors of restoration success. There was great variation in percentage survivorship (median = 24, range = 0-100%) and ABCsr (median = 0.009, range = 0-0.38 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)). The model using management variables explained less variance (53%) in survivorship than the model incorporating additional soil and rainfall covariates (62%). ABCsr models were better fits (78 and 88% variance explained, respectively). All model configurations identified browse intensity as a highly influential predictor of restoration success. Predicted success was highest for plots located in target habitat; however, only 45% were thus located, suggesting the need for expert input and habitat modelling for improving target habitat identification. Frost exposure was another important predictor influencing all models but was likely a consequence of locating sites off target habitat. Sites planted on equatorward slopes during the warm season showed reduced carbon sequestration, possibly due to elevated soil moisture stress associated with high radiation loads. Physiographic factors associated with improved restoration success were location on sloping ground (reduced frost exposure), increasing longitude (more warm-season rainfall) and increasing latitude (less frost coastwards). Few trends were evident among post-restoration climatic factors beyond the control of managers. Higher rainfall during the year post restoration had a negative impact on carbon sequestration while higher rain during the early months post restoration had a positive effect on both carbon sequestration and survivorship. Soil factors showed little importance for the survivorship model, whereas silt content, % K and Mg CEC emerged as predictors of carbon sequestration. Our results have direct relevance for improving the success of landscape-scale restoration projects envisioned for the ca. 8,930 km(2) of degraded spekboom thicket.

AB  - The leafless orchids are rare epiphytic plants with extremely reduced leaves, and their aerial roots adopted for photosynthesis. The beneficial plant-microbial interactions contribute significantly to host nutrition, fitness, and growth. However, there are no data available on the bacterial associations, inhabiting leafless orchids. Here, we describe the diversity of cyanobacteria, which colonize the roots of greenhouse Microcoelia moreauae and Chiloschista parishii. The biodiversity and structure of the cyanobacterial community were analyzed using a complex approach, comprising traditional cultivable techniques, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and phylogenetic analysis, as well as the light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A wide diversity of associated bacteria colonize the root surface, forming massive biofilms on the aerial roots. The dominant populations of filamentous nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria belonged to the orders Oscillatoriales, Synechococcales, and Nostocales. The composition of the cyanobacterial community varied, depending on the nitrogen supply. Two major groups prevailed under nitrogen-limiting conditions, belonging to Leptolyngbya sp. and Komarekiella sp. The latter was characterized by DGGE profiling and sequencing, as well as by its distinctive features of morphological plasticity. The leading role of these phototrophophic and diazotrophic cyanobacteria is discussed in terms of the epiphytic lifestyle of the leafless orchids.

AB  - Extensive mining operations, deforestation, jhumming, and soil erosion coupled with population stress in the study area have put an adverse effect on its forest resources. This study investigates the transition in forest cover classes and its fragmentation in the Jaintia Hills District of Meghalaya (India). Satellite data (multispectral images from Landsat 5 and 8) for 1995, 2001, 2007, and 2015 were classified using the supervised classification method. Landscape metrics from the classified images were calculated using FRAGSTATS. The overall accuracy of classification was found to be 87.50% (1995), 87.50% (2001), 85.00% (2007) and 91.67% (2015), respectively. The results revealed an increase in dense forest with an increase in the patch number from 1995 to 2007. Additionally, a decrease in non-forest cover with an increase in the number of patches from 2001 to 2015 was observed which further suggests fragmentation. It has been reported that 8.13% of the dense forest increased and 19.47% of non-forested areas decreased during the study period. Overall, this study highlights the changes in the distribution of forest area which could aid policy makers to adopt appropriate forest conservation strategies.

AB  - Fruticulture in the Amazonian Rainforest is one of the main causes of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and soil erosion. Fruticulture plays a key role in the soil traits and soil organic matter (SOM) compartments by altering the soil ecosystem. Our aim was to assess the influence of Forest-Fruticulture conversion on soil traits, and SOM fractions in Brazil's Legal Amazon. The experiment was carried out in field conditions using four land uses as main treatments: Bixa orellana, Theobroma grandiflorum, Paullinia cupana, and the Amazon Rainforest. The soil physicochemical traits were analyzed using samples that were collected from 0-5,5-10, and 10-20 cm soil depth by using grids (10 x 10 m) with 36 sampling points. Our results showed that the Fruticulture promoted an increase in bulk density, GMD, aggregate diameter, soil porosity, gravimetric moisture, sand, clay, carbon associated with humic acid, and, the sum of bases (K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+), while the Amazon Rainforest showed the highest values of silt, soil P content, SOC, p-SOC, m-SOC, carbon associated with fulvic acid, humine, and soil C stock.

AB  - Many tree genera in the Malesian uplands have Southern Hemisphere origins, often supported by austral fossil records. Weathering the vast bedrock exposures in the everwet Malesian tropics may have consumed sufficient atmospheric CO2 to contribute significantly to global cooling over the past 15 Myr. However, there has been no discussion of how the distinctive regional tree assemblages may have enhanced weathering and contributed to this process. We postulate that Gondwanan-sourced tree lineages that can dominate higher-elevation forests played an overlooked role in the Neogene CO2 drawdown that led to the Ice Ages and the current, now-precarious climate state. Moreover, several historically abundant conifers in Araucariaceae and Podocarpaceae are likely to have made an outsized contribution through soil acidification that increases weathering. If the widespread destruction of Malesian lowland forests continues to spread into the uplands, the losses will threaten unique austral plant assemblages and, if our hypothesis is correct, a carbon sequestration engine that could contribute to cooler planetary conditions far into the future. Immediate effects include the spread of heat islands, significant losses of biomass carbon and forest-dependent biodiversity, erosion of watershed values, and the destruction of tens of millions of years of evolutionary history.

AB  - The knowledge of the geographical distribution of fungi is essential to promote the understanding of global and national fungal diversity patterns. In this study, we provide a literature-based checklist of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Talaromyces species recorded in the biomes of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and the Brazilian Pampa. Only Penicillium digitatom was reported for the Pampa biome. For the Atlantic Forest, a total of 169 species (68 Aspergillus, 79 Penicillium, and 22 Talaromyces) are reported, of which 20 are typified with specimens from this biome, including the novel species Penicillium nordestinense (section Lanata-Divaricata) that is described in this study. Penicillium nordestinense is phylogenetically related to the invalidly described species Penicillium setosum, and this species is validated here. Soil was the most common substrate from where species were reported. Several reported species are well known in biotechnological processes. Penicihhiopsis zonata and Sclerocleista ornata, species previously treated in Aspergillus, are recorded. This checklist reflects the limited knowledge of fungal species in tropical environments, such as the Brazilian Atlantic Forest and Pampa biomes. This information is a good framework for understanding the Brazilian diversity of Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Talaromyces and provides data for future fungal biogeographical studies in tropical environments.

AB  - Urban forests and parks are essential for the maintenance of biodiversity as well as human health and well-being. Residents and tourists commonly use urban forests and parks for recreational and sport purposes, contributing to changes in vegetation. This study aimed to assess the effect of distance from formal paths on the abiotic conditions, vegetation cover, as well as ecological diversity of vascular plant species in the undergrowth of urban forests and parks. The investigations were carried out in 2021 in 10 urban forests and 10 urban parks located in Krakow (southern Poland), using a total of 400 plots (1 x 1 m) situated in close (CL) and further (FU) vicinity of formal paths. We found a positive effect of the distance from the path on the depth of the compact soil layer, vegetation cover and height of the tallest shoot in the undergrowth of urban forests and parks. On the other hand, the distance from the path had a negative effect on the number of vascular plant species in the undergrowth in both forests and parks. Forests and parks differed significantly from each other in light intensity, the content of P in soil, depth of compact soil layer, number of species, as well as in cover-abundance of species representing different life forms, dispersal types, habitat affiliations and origins. Trampling leads to low plant cover and height of the undergrowth, as well as contributing to shallow localization of the compact soil layer near paths. Human movement on paths (walking, running, biking) with accompanying pets contributes to the successful dispersal of plants, resulting in high species richness. High light intensity in urban parks enhances the total number of species, cover-abundance of meadow and grassland plants, as well as cover-abundance of hemicryptophytes. The number of alien species was higher in parks than in forests, but the cover-abundance of alien plants was higher in forests than in parks. Urban forests are more suitable for the growth and biomass production of some alien herbs than urban parks, as mowing commonly used in parks appears to be an important factor in reducing their cover abundance. Regular fertilization and irrigation contribute to the high content of phosphorus in the soil, as well as to the high cover-abundance of meadow and grassland plants in urban parks. Urban forests enhance cover abundance of plants with dispersal mechanisms of the Bidens and Lycopodium types, whereas urban parks promote cover abundance of plants with the dispersal of the Allium type. Further study is needed to confirm the role of urban forests and parks in the preservation of ancient forest species, as well as to develop an appropriate design of paths that will allow the protection of vegetation and soil in urban forests and parks.

AB  - In view of the rapidly declining native plant cover due to existing harsh climate and uncontrolled grazing, Kuwait has undertaken initiatives to revegetate the desert land with native species to improve plant cover, soil stabilization, biodiversity and ecological processes. Because of the high temperature during long summer months and sandy soil types, transplanted seedlings are irrigated regularly, mostly with brackish groundwater. This study was undertaken to evaluate survival, growth and proline accumulation of transplanted Vachellia pachyceras, Rhanterium epapposum, Farsetia aegyptia and Haloxylon salicornicum seedlings that were irrigated with four levels of saline water ranging from EC 1.6 to 5.5 dS/m for 14 months. Irrigation with different salinity levels had no significant effect on seedlings survival in V. pachyceras, H. salicornicum and R. epapposum while F. aegyptia exhibited only 38% survival under brackish water irrigation. Total plant biomass declined with increasing salinity in irrigation water except in R. epapposum. However, salinity of irrigation water did not increase proline content. Present results suggest that revegetation involving these four native species can be implemented using brackish groundwater with salinity level up to EC of 5.5 dS/m in arid and semiarid regions where freshwater is scarce and need for revegetation is critically important.

AB  - Trait-based approaches to calculate ecological strategy is important for understanding forest succession dynamics. However, the functional traits and ecological strategy change during succession remain poorly understood. We measured key leaf traits and calculated scores for CSR ecological strategy for 13 co-existing species in different successional stages in tropical lowland rain forests. We analyzed the patterns of functional traits and CSR strategies varied along the succession. The relationship between CSR strategy and environmental factors was examined. Our research results are as follows: (1) In older plots, LDMC was generally lower and SLA was generally higher than younger plots with the succession, the functional traits of the successional co-existing tree species changed, and SLA and LDMC showed significant differences. (2) The co-existing tree species' strategies shifted from S/CS and CS strategies to CS/CSR and CS strategies along the succession. (3) Ecological strategies are linked to different combinations of environmental factors across the four successional stages. Our study suggests that the co-existing tree species in different succession stages of tropical lowland rain forests have a high degree of resistance and a conservative ecological strategy, which is significantly related to canopy openness, soil water content, and soil nutrients.

AB  - This article showcases the outcomes of a comprehensive spatiotemporal dynamic analysis conducted in forest vegetation areas within the forest-steppe zone of the Central Russian Upland (eastern Europe), spanning the period from 1970 to 2020. This study utilized high-resolution data from the Corona satellite system from the year 1970 as well as satellite imagery from the ArcGIS World Imagery database. Soil properties and their changes were assessed based on the analysis of soil bulk density (930 samples), soil organic carbon features, pH, available phosphorus, and the composition of salt extracts (1362 samples). We collected and analyzed 3920 soil samples in the field to study the impact of shelterbelts on soil moisture over a period of two years. For six selected key sites with a total area of 1722 km2, it was found that over a 50-year period, the area covered by forest vegetation increased from 14% to 24%. This expansion was primarily due to the planting and growth of young shelterbelts in the 1970s-1980s as well as widening anti-erosion shelterbelts on slopes and gullies. The average linear growth rate of forest vegetation boundaries was found to be 23.5 m (4.7 m per decade) for the entire study area. The expansion was highest on west-facing slopes, which was attributed to the higher moisture content from windward atmospheric precipitation events. However, alongside the increase in forest cover, degradation was also observed, particularly in old-age shelterbelts, which was attributed to increased fragmentation and mortality. A gradual increase in the extent of shelterbelt degradation was observed from the northwest to the southeast within the forest-steppe region, corresponding to areas with a drier climate. Additionally, the impact of shelterbelts on soil properties and soil cover was analyzed using four key sites and using fields and laboratory research methods. We detected a lateral uptake of substances from plowed soils into the soils of shelterbelts and vertical uptake from deep layers. The two-year observations (2020 and 2021) of soil moisture during the growing season (May-September) in two climatically contrasting forest-steppe areas revealed a more intensive accumulation of soil moisture in fields west of shelterbelts compared to those to the east of them, particularly within the 10 m zone near the shelterbelts. This can be attributed to arable fields on the windward side receiving more moisture compared to the leeward side. The formation of striped microstructures in the soil cover that occurred under the shelterbelts and on adjacent arable lands was influenced by various factors such as microclimatic conditions, vegetation types, ecological conditions for soil fauna, and human-induced soil processing and transformation along the shelterbelt boundaries. Shelterbelts and their adjacent areas in agro-landscapes are considered to be self-developing natural-anthropogenic geosystems with their own organizational structure. Therefore, their study is recommended as an integral part of modern geographical zoning.

AB  - Forests contribute strongly to global carbon (C) sequestration and the exchange of greenhouse gases (GHG) between the soil and the atmosphere. Whilst the microbial activity of forest soils is a major determinant of net GHG exchange, this may be modified by the presence of litter through a range of mechanisms. Litter may act as a physical barrier modifying gas exchange, water movement/retention and temperature/irradiance fluctuations; provide a source of nutrients for microbes; enhance any priming effects, and facilitate macro-aggregate formation. Moreover, any effects are influenced by litter quality and regulated by tree species, climatic conditions (rainfall, temperature), and forest management (clear-cutting, fertilization, extensive deforestation). Based on climate change projections, the importance of the litter layer is likely to increase due to an litter increase and changes in quality. Future studies will therefore have to take into account the effects of litter on soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes for various types of forests globally, including the impact of climate change, insect infestation, and shifts in tree species composition, as well as a better understanding of its role in monoterpene production, which requires the integration of microbiological studies conducted on soils in different climatic zones.

AB  - Microbial communities play critical roles in fixing carbon from the atmosphere and fixing it in the soils. However, the large-scale variations and drivers of these microbial communities remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a large-scale survey across China and found that soil autotrophic organisms are critical for explaining CO2 fluxes from the atmosphere to soils. In particular, we showed that large-scale variations in CO2 fixation rates are highly correlated to those in autotrophic bacteria and phototrophic protists. Paddy soils, supporting a larger proportion of obligate bacterial and protist autotrophs, display four-fold of CO2 fixation rates over upland and forest soils. Precipitation and pH, together with key ecological clusters of autotrophic microbes, also played important roles in controlling CO2 fixation. Our work provides a novel quantification on the contribution of terrestrial autotrophic microbes to soil CO2 fixation processes at a large scale, with implications for global carbon regulation under climate change.

AB  - Fairy circles (FCs) are regular vegetation patterns found in drylands of Namibia and Western Australia. It is virtually unknown whether they are also present in other regions of the world and which environmental factors determine their distribution. We conducted a global systematic survey and found FC-like vegetation patterns in 263 sites from 15 countries and three continents, including the Sahel, Madagascar, and Middle-West Asia. FC-like vegetation patterns are found in environments characterized by a unique combination of soil (including low nutrient levels and high sand content) and climatic (arid regions with high temperatures and high precipitation seasonality) conditions. In addition to these factors, the presence of specific biological elements (termite nests) in certain regions also plays a role in the presence of these patterns. Furthermore, areas with FC-like vegetation patterns also showed more stable temporal productivity patterns than those of surrounding areas. Our study presents a global atlas of FCs and provides unique insights into the ecology and biogeography of these fascinating vegetation patterns.

AB  - Forest biological disturbance agents (BDAs) are insects, pathogens, and parasitic plants that affect tree decline, mortality, and forest ecosystems processes. BDAs are commonly thought to increase the likelihood and severity of fire by converting live standing trees to more flammable, dead and downed fuel. However, recent research in-dicates that BDAs do not necessarily increase, and can reduce, the likelihood or severity of fire. This has led to confusion regarding the role of BDAs in influencing fuels and fire in fire-prone western United States forests. Here, we review the existing literature on BDAs and their effects on fuels and fire in the western US and develop a conceptual framework to better understand the complex relationships between BDAs, fuels and fire. We ask: 1) What are the major BDA groups in western US forests that affect fuels? and 2) How do BDA-affected fuels in-fluence fire risk and outcomes? The conceptual framework is rooted in the spatiotemporal aspects of BDA life histories, which drive forest impacts, fuel characteristics and if ignited, fire outcomes. Life histories vary among BDAs from episodic, landscape-scale outbreaks (bark beetles, defoliators), to chronic, localized disturbance ef-fects (dwarf mistletoes, root rots). Generally, BDAs convert aboveground live biomass to dead biomass, decreasing canopy fuels and increasing surface fuels. However, the rate of conversion varies with time-since -event and among BDAs and forest types, resulting in a wide range of effects on the amount of dead fuels at any given time and place, which interacts with the structure and composition of the stand before and subsequent to BDA events. A major influence on fuels may be that BDAs have emerged as dominant agents of forest het-erogeneity creation. Because BDAs play complex roles in fuels and fire heterogeneity across the western US which are further complicated by interactions with climate change, drought, and forest management (fire sup-pression), their impacts on fuels, fire and ecological consequences cannot be categorized simply as positive or negative but need to be evaluated within the context of BDA life histories and ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - 1. Variation in decay rates across woody species is a key uncertainty in predicting the fate of carbon stored in deadwood, especially in the tropics. Quantifying the relative contributions of biotic decay agents, particularly microbes and termites, under different climates and across species with diverse wood traits could help explain this variation.2. To fill this knowledge gap, we deployed woody stems from 16 plant species native to either rainforest (n = 10) or savanna (n = 6) in northeast Australia, with and without termite access. For comparison, we also deployed standardized, non-native pine blocks at both sites. We hypothesized that termites would in- crease rates of deadwood decay under conditions that limit microbial activity. Specifically, termite contributions to wood decay should be greater under dry conditions and in wood species with traits that constrain microbial decomposers.3. Termite discovery of stems was surprisingly low with only 17.6% and 22.6% of accessible native stems discovered in the rainforest and savanna respectively. Contrary to our hypothesis, stems discovered by termites decomposed faster only in the rainforest. Termites discovered and decayed pine blocks at higher rates than native stems in both the rainforest and savanna.4. We found significant variation in termite discovery and microbial decay rates across native wood species within the same site. Although wood traits explained 85% of the variation in microbial decay, they did not explain termite-driven decay. For stems undiscovered by termites, decay rates were greater in species with higher wood nutrient concentrations and syringyl:guiacyl lignin ratios but lower carbon concentrations and wood densities.5. Synthesis. Ecosystem -scale predictions of deadwood turnover and carbon storage should account for the impact of wood traits on decomposer communities. In tropical Australia, termite-driven decay was lower than expected for native wood on the ground. Even if termites are present, they may not always increase decomposition rates of fallen native wood in tropical forests. Our study shows how the drivers of wood decay differ between Australian tropical rainforest and savanna; further research should test whether such differences apply world -wide.

AB  - Natural forests are an important source of livelihood for various communities. Yet economically important fruit tree species endemic to sub Saharan Africa e.g. Sclerocaryea birrea (Marula) are critically endangered due to over-exploitation and climate change. Effective conservation, management and utilization of native fruit trees require accurate quantitative information on how the trees interact with their environment. In this study we investigated the water use patterns and fruit yield dynamics of S. birrea, and another widely used species Strychnos spinosa (Monkey orange) growing on nutrient poor sandy soils in northern KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. The study aimed to understand how the water use and yield of these species are influenced by climate and soils. These data are essential to support biodiversity conservation and management, and agroforestry programs. Transpiration was measured on co-occurring trees of each species over two years using the heat ratio sap flow method. The sap flow and environmental data were used to develop and test a simple Penman-Monteith transpiration model. The model provided insights on how environmental factors affected water use and yield in the trees' natural habitats. The two species had similar diurnal transpiration trends characterized by midday stomatal closure. Peak transpiration per unit leaf area was higher for S. spinosa (similar to 2.3 L/m(2)/d) than S. birrea (similar to 1.4 L/m(2)/d). S. birrea transpiration responded strongly to rainfall pulses with the soil water deficit explaining similar to 65% of the variation in tree water use. S. spinosa transpiration, on the other hand, was largely driven by the atmospheric evaporative demand rather than by soil water availability (R-2 < 0.10), suggesting that the two species had different mechanisms to cope with drought stress. Despite the contrasting water relations, transpiration could be determined accurately using the combination model. The model has potential applications in agroforestry and species-specific conservation programs by providing accurate information on their water requirements. (c) 2022 SAAB.

AB  - The world's terrestrial biomes are broadly classified according to the dominant plant growth forms that define ecosystem structure and processes. Although the abundance and distribution of different plant growth forms can be strongly determined by factors such as climate and soil composition, large mammalian herbivores have a strong impact on plant communities, thus defaunation (the local or functional extinction of large animals) has the potential to alter the compositional structure of plant growth forms in natural ecosystems. Tropical rainforests sustain a high diversity of growth forms, including trees, palms, lianas, shrubs, herbs and bamboos, all of which play important ecosystem functions. Here, we experimentally evaluate how large mammalian herbivores affect the dominance, diversity and coexistence of these major tropical forest plant growth forms, by monitoring communities of saplings on the understorey in 43 paired exclusion plots in a long-term replicated exclusion experiment in the understorey of the Atlantic forest of Brazil. Over the course of 10 years large herbivore exclusion decreased diversity among growth forms, increased the absolute abundance of palms and trees (22% and 38% respectively) and increased the diversity of species within these two groups, to the detriment of other growth forms. Furthermore, all pairwise relationships between growth forms were positive on plots where herbivores had access, whereas several strong negative relationships emerged in plots where herbivores were excluded. This occurred despite strong background directional temporal trends affecting plant communities in both experimental treatments across the region. Synthesis. Our work indicates that the defaunation alters growth form dominance by favouring palms and trees while eroding diversity among growth forms and coexistence on a temporal scale. Large herbivore mammals promote diversity among growth forms, preventing the hyper-dominance of trees and palms, yet without supressing the diversity of species within growth forms. We argue that large herbivore mammals affect growth forms through several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, including herbivory, seed dispersal and physical disturbance, as well as differential effects linked to the morphological and physiological adaptations of growth forms. We conclude that defaunation might lead to profound impacts on important ecosystem functions underpinned by growth form diversity, and result in vertical and horizontal structural simplification of tropical rainforests.

AB  - Under drought stress, desert riparian forest plants are highly self-regulating and have their own unique water use and regulation strategies, which can respond positively in several aspects such as physiology, ecology, and individual phenotypes when coping and adapting to the stresses brought by external environmental changes. In addition, as an important component of arid zone ecosystems, desert riparian forest plants maintain the cycling process of energy and material in desert areas. Therefore, it is of great ecological value to study the role played by desert riparian forest plants in desertification control and biodiversity conservation in arid zones. The purpose of this study is to provide basic data and scientific basis for the conservation, and restoration of desert riparian forests in the inland river basin of arid zone. In this paper, the physiological and ecological responses of desert riparian plants under drought stress were analyzed by reviewing the literature and focusing on the key scientific issues such as drought avoidance mechanisms, water use, and water redistribution, and the relationship between interspecific water competition and resource sharing of desert riparian plants. The results showed that: (1) In the inland river basin of arid zone, desert riparian plants show a mutual coordination of increasing soluble sugars, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), and decreasing peroxidase (POD), to form a unique drought avoidance mechanism, and improve their drought tolerance by changing leaf stomatal conductance resulted from regulating abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin (CTK) content. (2) Desert riparian forest plants have their own unique water use and regulation strategies. When the degree of drought stress increased, Populus euphratica enhanced the water flow of dominant branches by actively sacrificing the inferior branches to ensure and improve the overall survival chances of the plant, while Tamarix ramosissima weaken hydraulic conductance, and increase subsurface material inputs by reducing plant height to cope with drought stress. (3) The root systems of desert riparian plants have hydraulic uplift and water redistribution functions, and, in the hydraulic uplift process of P. euphratica and T. ramosissima root systems, there is a possibility of assisting with other species in water utilization and the existence of a resource sharing mechanism.

AB  - The Global Plant Health Assessment (GPHA) is a collective, volunteer-based effort to assemble expert opinions on plant health and disease impacts on ecosystem services based on published scientific evidence. The GPHA considers a range of forest, agricultural, and urban systems worldwide. These are referred to as (Ecoregion x Plant System), i.e., selected case examples involving keystone plants in given parts of the world. The GPHA focuses on infectious plant diseases and plant pathogens, but encompasses the abiotic (e.g., temperature, drought, and floods) and other biotic (e.g., animal pests and humans) factors associated with plant health. Among the 33 (Ecoregion x Plant System) considered, 18 are assessed as in fair or poor health, and 20 as in declining health. Much of the observed state of plant health and its trends are driven by a combination of forces, including climate change, species invasions, and human management. Healthy plants ensure (i) provisioning (food, fiber, and material), (ii) regulation (climate, atmosphere, water, and soils), and (iii) cultural (recreation, inspiration, and spiritual) ecosystem services. All these roles that plants play are threatened by plant diseases. Nearly none of these three ecosystem services are assessed as improving. Results indicate that the poor state of plant health in sub-Saharan Africa gravely contributes to food insecurity and environmental degradation. Results further call for the need to improve crop health to ensure food security in the most populated parts of the world, such as in South Asia, where the poorest of the poor, the landless farmers, are at the greatest risk. The overview of results generated from this work identifies directions for future research to be championed by a new generation of scientists and revived public extension services. Breakthroughs from science are needed to (i) gather more data on plant health and its consequences, (ii) identify collective actions to manage plant systems, (iii) exploit the phytobiome diversity in breeding programs, (iv) breed for plant genotypes with resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses, and (v) design and implement plant systems involving the diversity required to ensure their adaptation to current and growing challenges, including climate change and pathogen invasions.

AB  - To have a cleaner environment, good well-being, and improve the health of citizens it is necessary to expand green urban and suburban areas using productive and adapted material of tree species. The quality of urban greenery, resistance to negative climate change factors and pollution, as well as efficiency of short-rotation forestry in suburban areas, depends primarily on the selection of hybrids and clones, suitable for the local environmental conditions. We postulate that ecogenetic response, phenotypic plasticity, and genotypic variation of hybrid poplars (Populus L.) grown in plantations are affected not only by the peculiarities of hybrids and clones, but also by environmental conditions of their vegetative propagation. The aim of the present study was to estimate growth and biochemical responses, the phenotypic plasticity, genotypic variation of adaptive traits, and genetically regulated adaptability of Populus hybrids in field trials which may be predisposed by the simulated contrasting temperature conditions at their vegetative propagation phase. The research was performed with the 20 cultivars and experimental clones of one intraspecific cross and four different interspecific hybrids of poplars propagated under six contrasting temperature regimes in phytotron. The results suggest that certain environmental conditions during vegetative propagation not only have a short-term effect on tree viability and growth, but also can help to adapt to climate change conditions and grow successfully in the long-term. It was found that tree growth and biochemical traits (the chlorophyll A and B, pigments content and the chlorophyll A/B ratio) of hybrid poplar clones grown in field trials, as well as their traits' genetic parameters, were affected by the rooting-growing conditions during vegetative propagation phase. Hybrids P. balsamifera x P. trichocarpa, and P. trichocarpa x P. trichocarpa have shown the most substantial changes of biochemical traits across vegetative propagation treatments in field trial. Rooting-growing conditions during vegetative propagation had also an impact on coefficients of genotypic variation and heritability in hybrid poplar clones when grown in field trials.

AB  - We evaluated the structural and floristic characteristics of a Brazilian savanna fragment occupied by cerraddo (CD) and cerrado sensu stricto (CS) in response to the influence of rainfall and long-term fire suppression. We carried out floristic, phytosociological and remote sensing studies in a cerrado fragment located in Corumbatal (SP, Brazil) after 43 years of complete fire suppression. We surveyed 43 plots of 200 m(2) each (17 plots in CS and 26 plots in CD) and all individuals a >= 0.32 cm diameter measured at 30 cm from the ground were included in the sample. We calculated phytosociological parameters for each species and classified them in three ecological groups, namely savanna, generalist and forest species. The remote sensing analysis used aerial photographs and satellite images from 1962 to 2019 (i.e. 59 years). The structural study of community revealed high predominance of forest and generalist species when compared to savanna species. Non-linear correlation between CD expansion rates and total rainfall within the study period indicated a positive influence of the rainfall (R-2 = 0.42). Thus, our analysis indicated a tendency of a continuous and fast expansion of CD over areas of CS in the long-term absence of fire combined with periods of heavy rain.

AB  - Forest fragments in urban areas comprise important habitats for a wide variety of species, however, conservationist policies for their maintenance and conservation are still incipient. This study examined the richness and abundance of the ground-spider assemblage in five forest fragments, with areas ranging between 18.5 and 103.98 ha, in the urban perimeter of Sinop, northern Mato Grosso State, southern Amazon region of Brazil. Sampling was carried out using the mini-Winkler extractor and pitfall traps in the dry (July) and rainy (November) seasons of 2017. All fragments were characterized in relation to the area and the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI), to assess the effect of these variables on richness and abundance of soil spider assemblage. A total of 653 spiders were sampled, corresponding to 25 families and 52 species. Salticidae, Theridiidae, Lycosidae, Linyphiidae, Oonopidae and Symphytognathidae were the most abundant families (63.3% of the total sample). The assemblage was characterized by the dominance of hunting spiders (393 ind.; 60.2%) over web-building spiders (260 ind.; 39.8%). Greater spider abundance and richness was obtained during the rainy season (517 ind.; 79.2%; 41 spp.) as compared with the dry season (136 ind.; 20.8%; 24 spp.). Only 13 species occurred in dry and rainy season. Two species were recorded for the first time in the Amazon region, namely, Anapistula aquytabuera Rheims & Brescovit, 2003 (Symphytognathidae) and Opopaea concolor (Blackwall, 1859) (Oonopidae). Species richness was not affected by IBI and area of fragment. Although the statistical model is not significant, species richness increases slightly with IBI and area of fragment. Similarly, abundance of spiders was not affected by IBI and area of fragment. Regardless of the area size, all evaluated forest fragments showed a low and regular IBI, demonstrating that these habitats have suffered with the pressures inherent from the urban perimeter, including the constant expansion of human occupation as well as misuse by the population. Nonetheless, these same fragments revealed considerable richness of species of ground spiders and can thus be categorized as important habitats for the maintenance of regional biodiversity. Therefore, action strategies must be set out to ensure their conservation.

AB  - Aim of study: (i) To investigate the diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associated with the roots of seed trees stands in a conserved and natural population of mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla), based on rDNA sequences; and (ii) to evaluate the dual colonization by AMF and dark septate fungi (DSF), showing the types of fungal colonization patterns in the dry season..Area of study: Tropical rainforest of Ejido Laguna Om, Quintana Roo, Mexico.Materials and methods: We evaluated the AMF and DSF colonization in secondary root segments of ten adult trees of mahogany. We analysed the diversity of AMF in one composite sample of mahogany roots (three trees) using 18S rDNA gene with Illumina MiSeq platform.Main results: Through metabarcoding 14 virtual taxa belonging mainly to the genus Glomus and Diversispora were obtained, VTX00186 being the most abundant. The percentages of colonization for the different fungal structures were hyphae 80%, vesicles 18%, coils 2%, and arbuscules 0.5%; for DSF, 60% hyphae and 12% microsclerotia. The Paris-type colonization predominated with 61% in the roots.Research highlights: The knowledge of the AMF diversity present in natural mahogany forests will allow the selection of species for inoculation management seeking to enhance seedling survival and growth of this species.

AB  - Taratibu was recently declared as a key biodiversity area (KBA) and knowledge on its habitats is very important for the conservation of this area. The present study aimed to identify and describe the main habitats from Taratibu, in PNQ, in order to improve knowledge on its characteristics. For this, techniques of transect, point-square and point-quadrant were used for the vegetation survey and the abiotic parameters of each habitat were determined. Five habitats were described: closed seasonal riparian habitat of Siphonochilus and Rawsonia, with dominance of Rawsonia lucida, whose IVI was 14%, humid soil, maximum temperatures of 26 degrees C and with 89% canopy cover; semi-closed deciduous forest habitat of Bamboo and Milletia, with dominance of the Milletia stuhlmannii species, whose IVI was 42%, humid soil, maximum temperatures of 28 degrees C and with 73% canopy cover; open mountain habitat, vellozio-euphorbiaceae-Inselberg, with dominance of the Xerophyta argentea species, whose IVI was 38%, reasonable and dry soil, maximum temperatures of 30 degrees C and with 0% of tree canopy cover; semi-open Miombo deciduous forest habitat, with dominance of the Julbernadia globiflora species, whose IVI was 18%, dry soil, maximum temperatures of 28 degrees C and with 36% canopy cover; and closed Pouteria rain forest habitat, dominated by the Pouteria pseudoracemosa species, whose IVI was 30%, wet soil, maximum temperatures of 28 degrees C and with 88% canopy cover.

AB  - Despite the importance of tropical ecosystems for climate regulation, biodiversity, water and nutrient cycles, only a few Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs) are located in the tropics. Among these, most are in humid climates, while very few data exist for semi-arid and sub-humid climates, due to the difficulty of estimating hydro-geochemical balances in catchments with ephemeral streams. We contribute to fill this gap by presenting a meteorological and hydro-geochemical dataset acquired at the Mule Hole catchment (4.1 km(2)), a pristine dry deciduous forest located in a biosphere reserve in south India. The dataset consists of time series of variables related to (i) meteorology, including rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and global radiation, (ii) hydrology, including water level and discharge at the catchment outlet, (iii) hydrogeology, including manual (monthly) and/or automated (from 15 min to hourly) groundwater levels in nine piezometers and (iv) geochemistry, including suspended sediment content in the stream and chemical composition of rainfall (event based), groundwater (monthly sampling) and stream water (storm events, 15 min to hourly frequency with an automatic sampler). The time series extend from 2003 to 2019. Measurement errors are minimized by frequent calibration of sensors and quality checks, both in the field and in the laboratory. Despite these precautions, several data gaps exist, due to occasional access restriction to the site and instrument destruction by wildlife. Results show that large seasonal and interannual variations of climatic conditions were reflected in the large variations of stream flow and groundwater recharge, as well as in water chemical composition. Notably, they reveal a long-term evolution of groundwater storage, suggesting hydrogeological cycles on a decadal scale. This dataset, alone or in combination with other data, has already allowed to better understand water and element cycling in tropical dry forests, and the role of forest diversity on biogeochemical cycles. As tropical ecosystems are underrepresented by Critical Zone Observatories, we expect this data note to be valuable for the global scientific community.

AB  - Closely related tree species that grow in sympatry are abundant in rainforests. However, little is known of the ecoevolutionary processes that govern their niches and local coexistence. We assessed genetic species delimitation in closely related sympatric species belonging to two Neotropical tree species complexes and investigated their genomic adaptation to a fine-scale topographic gradient with associated edaphic and hydrologic features. Combining LiDAR-derived topography, tree inventories, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from gene capture experiments, we explored genome-wide population genetic structure, covariation of environmental variables, and genotype-environment association to assess microgeographic adaptations to topography within the species complexes Symphonia (Clusiaceae), and Eschweilera (Lecythidaceae) with three species per complex and 385 and 257 individuals genotyped, respectively. Within species complexes, closely related tree species had different realized optima for topographic niches defined through the topographic wetness index or the relative elevation, and species displayed genetic signatures of adaptations to these niches. Symphonia species were genetically differentiated along water and nutrient distribution particularly in genes responding to water deprivation, whereas Eschweilera species were genetically differentiated according to soil chemistry. Our results suggest that varied topography represents a powerful driver of processes modulating tropical forest biodiversity with differential adaptations that stabilize local coexistence of closely related tree species.

AB  - Haloxylon ammodendron is the main constituent species in the desert area of Junggar Basin, which plays a key role in biodiversity protection and regional ecological balance. Replenishment and settling capacity of seedlings determine population regeneration and community stability, and soil moisture and nutrients are the main limiting factors of natural regeneration. In view of the serious degradation and low seedling survival rate of Haloxylon ammodendron forest in Junggar, typical degraded Haloxylon ammodendron population was selected in Gurbantunggut Desert. The effects of soil moisture on soil nutrients were explored, and the temporal and geographical fluctuations of soil moisture and nutrients in the root zone of Haloxylon ammodendron seedlings were clarified. The results showed that soil moisture and nutrient content in the root zone of seedlings had obvious temporal and spatial variation characteristics. With the advance of the growth period, it decreased at first and then increased, reaching the maximum in April and the minimum in August. In the soil horizontal space (0 similar to 40 cm), with the extension of the horizontal distance, the soil moisture content has an obvious "wet island" effect, and the soil moisture content at the 10 cm level is 1.99 times that at the 40 cm level in August, when the growth period is the driest. The nutrients available in the soil were clearly "poor on the inside and high on the outside." The degrees of soil natural matter, soluble hydrolyzable nitrogen, accessible phosphorus, and accessible potassium in August were 57.97%, 44.37%, 75.46%, 19, and 55% higher at the 40 cm level of the sapling spine, 10 cm level each. The soil moisture content increased first, then declined, and the soil nutrient content gradually fell in the vertical (0.50 cm) space of soil as soil depth increased. The soil moisture content in the 20 similar to 30 cm layer is the highest, reaching 11.04%, 7.90%, 2.92%, and 4.29%, respectively, in each period. Soil water content in 0 similar to 30 cm was significantly affected by habitat rainfall (P < 0.05), and soil water had a higher effect on soil organic matter, alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen, and available potassium (P < 0.05).

AB  - The cultivation of sugar cane generates impacts on ecosystems, two of the four most relevant impacts are environmental, on the one hand, the generation of greater water stress due to irrigation needs, in addition to the impact on biodiversity and endemic species due to land use, highlighting the need for the development of policies for sugarcane production trying to mitigate these impacts [1]. This is how a dynamic simulation is proposed that addresses elements of sugarcane cultivation considering a case of traditional plantation and another organic one to estimate the environmental effects produced by irrigation, which generates depletion of the water resource, and the control of pests and weeds that cause contamination in the soil through the application of chemicals. The proposed model was applied using the Vensim PLE software considering interrelationships between these elements. In this way, it was possible to conclude that the depletion of the water resource and the contamination of the soil is lower in organic cultivation, consuming 10.5% less water, in addition they are not considered pollutants in the soil, but in the traditional cultivation reaches 1674 l/ha. It is important to note that for the model to be able to correctly support decision-making, additional aspects that affect the yield of each type of crop, as well as its profit margin and volatility, must be considered.

AB  - 1. Despite their exceptional biodiversity and carbon stocks, more than 80% of tropical forests are disturbed. However, a lot of interrogations remain around the ability of vegetation attributes in tropical forests to recover from the various anthropogenic disturbances coexisting in many tropical landscapes. While these different disturbances are usually studied separately, this work provides, for the first time, a common modelling framework of vegetation attribute recovery in differently disturbed forests.2. We develop an original Bayesian hierarchical model of recovery trajectories, considering disturbed forests in a common framework, through a disturbance intensity gradient. As a case study, we test our modelling approach on data from two long-term experiments, Tirimbina (Costa Rica) and Paracou (French Guiana), where forest permanent sample plots have been set up following selective logging (63.25 ha), agriculture (4 ha), and clearcutting+fire (6.25 ha).3. We build a modelling framework that stands out by: (i) its interpretability, with model parameters having a clear ecological meaning; (ii) its robustness, allowing to compare parameter values amongst ecological systems to ensure that predictions are ecologically sound; (iii) its versatility to consider disturbance intensity through postdisturbance changes in a structural variable, either as input data, or as a transformed parameter without requiring pre-disturbance monitoring; (iv) its flexibility to explicitly consider, and test, the effects on forest recovery of various disturbance types, along an intensity gradient, in a single integrative model.4. First conclusions drawn from our common framework underline the strongest above-ground biomass and diversity recovery rate offered by selective logging, compared to agriculture and clearcutting+fire, as well as the strong effect of disturbance intensity on taxonomic composition recovery.5. Considering disturbed forests in a common framework might help managers to know which disturbance types need to be firmly avoided, which intensity range makes human activities sustainable in forested environments, and where inexpensive natural regeneration should be favoured over active restoration, such as tree planting. Testing this framework with various monitoring tools to estimate disturbance intensity and model vegetation attribute recovery, i.e., with forest monitoring or remote sensing data, will be the next step to make it widely applicable.

AB  - Under continuous human disturbance, regeneration is the basis for biodiversity persistence and ecosystem service provision. In tropical dry forests, edaphic ecosystem engineering by biological soil crusts (biocrusts) could impact regeneration by influencing erosion control and soil water and nutrient fluxes, which impact landscape hydrology, geomorphology, and ecosystem functioning. This study investigated the effect of cyanobacteria-dominated biocrusts on water infiltration and aggregate stability in a human-modified landscape of the Caatinga dry forest (NE Brazil), a system characterized by high levels of forest degradation and increasing aridity. By trapping dust and swelling of cyanobacterial filaments, biocrusts can seal soil surfaces and slow down infiltration, which potentially induces erosion. To quantify hydraulic properties and erosion control, we used minidisc-infiltrometry, raindrop-simulation, and wet sieving at two sites with contrasting disturbance levels: an active cashew plantation and an abandoned field experiencing forest regeneration, both characterized by sandy soils. Under disturbance, biocrusts had a stronger negative impact on infiltration (reduction by 42% vs. 37% during regeneration), although biocrusts under regenerating conditions had the lowest absolute sorptivity (0.042 +/- 0.02 cm s(-1/2)) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (0.0015 +/- 0.0008 cm s(-1)), with a doubled water repellency. Biocrusts provided high soil aggregate stability although stability increased considerably with progression of biocrust succession (raindrop simulation disturbed: 0.19 +/- 0.22 J vs. regenerating: 0.54 +/- 0.22 J). The formation of stable aggregates by early successional biocrusts on sandy soils suggests protection of dry forest soils even on the worst land use/soil degradation scenario with a high soil erosion risk. Our results confirm that biocrusts covering bare interspaces between vascular plants in human-modified landscapes play an important role in surface water availability and erosion control. Biocrusts have the potential to reduce land degradation, but their associated ecosystem services like erosion protection, can be impaired by disturbance. Considering an average biocrust coverage of 8.1% of the Caatinga landscapes, further research should aim to quantify the contribution of biocrusts to forest recovery to fully understand the role they play in the functioning of this poorly explored ecosystem.

AB  - Numerous wildlife species visit salt licks to consume soil (geophagy) or to drink water. Studies have mostly focused on salt lick use by mammals as they are easily identified owing to larger body size, predominance in using these resources, and predictable movement and behaviour, as well as several established hypotheses such as mineral supplementation. However, salt licks are also crucial to some birds. The interest in and documentation of avifaunal geophagy at salt licks have increased in recent years. However, few studies have investigated this phenomenon in Southeast Asia. We used camera traps to document bird species richness, diversity and encounter rates at 20 salt licks (nine natural and 11 artificial) within three reserves (the Royal Belum State Park, Perak and Krau Wildlife Reserve, Pahang, both primary forest, and secondary forest in Tembat Forest Reserve) in Peninsular Malaysia. We compared parameters between the two types of salt lick (natural and artificial) and two types of habitats (primary and secondary forest). We found that salt licks were used by 24 bird species, including pheasants, hornbills, rails, herons, doves, cuckoos, pittas, bulbuls, flycatchers, and estrildid finches. Raptors did not exhibit geophagous behaviour, except for the Brown Wood-Owl (Strix leptogrammica). Most salt lick users were resident carnivores and insectivores. The Asian Emerald Dove (Chalcophaps indica) and Red Junglefowl (Gallus gallus) were the most frequent birds at salt licks. Avian species richness in primary forests was similar for both types of salt licks, but species diversity was higher at natural salt licks. Meanwhile, species diversity at artificial salt licks was similar by habitat type, but bird's species richness was significantly higher at primary forest artificial salt licks than at secondary forest artificial licks. Encounter rates of birds at artificial salt licks were higher than natural salt licks in primary forests. Furthermore, bird encounter rates at secondary forest artificial salt licks were higher than at primary forest artificial licks. We suggest that artificial salt licks can be used to enrich degraded forests since they serve a role similar to that of natural salt licks and can attract birds and other animals. This information is crucial to conservation and biodiversity management planning for protected forests, particularly secondary and degraded forests.

AB  - 1. Microhabitat differentiation of species communities such as vertical stratification in tropical forests contributes to species coexistence and thus biodiversity. However, little is known about how the extent of stratification changes during forest recovery and influences community reassembly. Environmental filtering determines community reassembly in time (succession) and in space (stratification), hence functional and phylogenetic composition of species communities are highly dynamic. It is poorly understood if and how these two concurrent filters-forest recovery and stratification-interact.2. In a tropical forest chronosequence in Ecuador spanning 34 years of natural recovery, we investigated the recovery trajectory of ant communities in three over- lapping strata (ground, leaf litter, lower tree trunk) by quantifying 13 traits, as well as the functional and phylogenetic diversity of the ants. We expected that functional and phylogenetic diversity would increase with recovery time and that each ant community within each stratum would show a distinct functional reassembly. We predicted that traits related to ant diet would show divergent trajectories reflecting an increase in niche differentiation with recovery time. On the other hand, traits related to the abiotic environment were predicted to show convergent trajectories due to a more similar microclimate across strata with increasing recovery age.3. Most of the functional traits and the phylogenetic diversity of the ants were clearly stratified, confirming previous findings. However, neither functional nor phylogenetic diversity increased with recovery time. Community-weighted trait means had complex relationships to recovery time and the majority were shaped by a statistical interaction between recovery time and stratum, confirming our expectations. However, most trait trajectories converged among strata with in- creasing recovery time regardless of whether they were related to ant diet or environmental conditions.4. We confirm the hypothesized interaction among environmental filters during the functional reassembly in tropical forests. Communities in individual strata respond differently to recovery, and possible filter mechanisms likely arise from both abiotic (e.g. microclimate) and biotic (e.g. diet) conditions. Since vertical stratification is prevalent across animal and plant taxa, our results highlight the importance of stratum-specific analysis in dynamic ecosystems and may generalize beyond ants.

AB  - Tropical forests are important to the regulation of climate and the maintenance of biodiversity on Earth. However, these ecosystems are threatened by climate change, as temperatures rise and droughts' frequency and duration increase. Xylem anatomical traits are an essential component in understanding and predicting forest responses to changes in water availability. We calculated the community-weighted means and variances of xylem anatomical traits of hydraulic and structural importance (plot-level trait values weighted by species abundance) to assess their linkages to local adaptation and community assembly in response to varying soil water conditions in an environmentally diverse Brazilian Atlantic Forest habitat. Scaling approaches revealed community-level tradeoffs in xylem traits not observed at the species level. Towards drier sites, xylem structural reinforcement and integration balanced against hydraulic efficiency and capacitance xylem traits, leading to changes in plant community diversity. We show how general community assembly rules are reflected in persistent fiber-parenchyma and xylem hydraulic tradeoffs. Trait variation across a moisture gradient is larger between species than within species and is realized mainly through changes in species composition and abundance, suggesting habitat specialization. Modeling efforts to predict tropical forest diversity and drought sensitivity may benefit from adding hydraulic architecture traits into the analysis.

AB  - Vegetation dynamics are affected not only by the concurrent climate but also by memory-induced lagged responses. For example, favourable climate in the past could stimulate vegetation growth to surpass the ecosystem carrying capacity, leaving an ecosystem vulnerable to climate stresses. This phenomenon, known as structural overshoot, could potentially contribute to worldwide drought stress and forest mortality but the magnitude of the impact is poorly known due to the dynamic nature of overshoot and complex influencing timescales. Here, we use a dynamic statistical learning approach to identify and characterize ecosystem structural overshoot globally and quantify the associated drought impacts. We find that structural overshoot contributed to around 11% of drought events during 1981-2015 and is often associated with compound extreme drought and heat, causing faster vegetation declines and greater drought impacts compared to non-overshoot related droughts. The fraction of droughts related to overshoot is strongly related to mean annual temperature, with biodiversity, aridity and land cover as secondary factors. These results highlight the large role vegetation dynamics play in drought development and suggest that soil water depletion due to warming-induced future increases in vegetation could cause more frequent and stronger overshoot droughts.
   Structural overshoot can occur when phases of excess plant growth deplete soil moisture too rapidly. The authors quantify structural overshoots using remote sensing datasets from 1981 to 2015, finding that 11% of droughts during this period could be attributed to structural overshoot.

AB  - Acid rain deposition (AR) has long-lasting implications for the community stability and biodiversity conservation in southwest China. Acer catalpifolium is a critically endangered species in the rain zone of Western China where AR occurs frequently. To understand the effects of AR on the morphology and physiology of A. catalpifolium, we conducted an acid stress simulation experiment for 1.5 years. The morphological, physiological, and photosynthetic responses of A. catalpifolium to the acidity, composition, and deposition pattern of acid stress was observed. The results showed that simulated acid stress can promote the growth of A. catalpifolium via the soil application mode. The growth improvement of A. catalpifolium under nitric-balanced acid rain via the soil application mode was greater than that of sulfuric-dominated acid rain via the soil application mode. On the contrary, the growth of A. catalpifolium was significantly inhibited by acid stress and the inhibition increased with the acidity of acid stress applied via leaf spraying. The inhibitory impacts of nitric-balanced acid rain via the leaf spraying of A. catalpifolium were greater than that of sulfur-dominant acid rain via leaf spraying. The observations presented in this work can be utilized for considering potential population restoration plans for A. catalpifolium, as well as the forests in southwest China.

AB  - Climate change will cause substantial vegetation shifts across the world. Africa may face varying dynamics such as tree decline, savannization, and woody encroachment due to rising temperatures and rainfall changes. This study examines the potential effects of climate change on Kenyan vegetation and vegetation shifts for 2050 and 2100, employing a statistical model to predict vegetation state as driven by environmental variables, including temperature, soil moisture, livestock density, and topography. We evaluate the model by hindcasting it from 2020 to 2000 and then project future vegetation states for 2050 and 2100 under SSP 2-4.5 and SSP 5-8.5. In response to moderate emissions, a notable increase in arid-associated shrubland vegetation (53-58%) is forecasted, leading to the expansion of drylands at the expense of savannas, grasslands, and forests. Under high-emission scenarios, savannas are forecasted to expand (52-65%) at the expense of forested areas. Overall, dense forest cover declines across scenarios, affecting protected areas by promoting increased savanna cover and reducing forest area (40% to 50%). These projected shifts in major vegetation types would likely alter ecosystem functioning and associated services, impacting pastoralists and wildlife and raising biodiversity concerns. Protected areas in Kenya could lose 50% of their forests, highlighting the urgency of climate change mitigation. These findings offer a crucial foundation for future research and action on Kenya's vegetation.

AB  - The Cerrado is the most diverse tropical savanna worldwide and the second-largest biome in South America. The objective of this study was to understand the heterogeneity and dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in different types of natural Cerrado vegetation and areas that are transitioning to dryer savannas or tropical rainforests and to elucidate the driving factors responsible for the differences between these ecosystems. Twenty-one natural sites were investigated, including typical Cerrado forest, typical Caatinga, Atlantic Rainforest, transitions between Cerrado and Caatinga, Cerrado areas near Caatinga or rainforest, and Carrasco sites. Spores were extracted from the soils, counted, and morphologically analyzed. In total, 82 AMF species were detected. AMF species richness varied between 36 and 51, with the highest richness found in the area transitioning between Cerrado and Caatinga, followed by areas of Cerrado close to Caatinga and typical Cerrado forest. The types of Cerrado vegetation and the areas transitioning to the Caatinga shared the highest numbers of AMF species (32-38). Vegetation, along with chemical and physical soil parameters, affected the AMF communities, which may also result from seasonal rainfall patterns. The Cerrado has a great AMF diversity and is, consequently, a natural refuge for AMF. The plant and microbial communities as well as the diversity of habitats require urgent protection within the Cerrado, as it represents a key AMF hotspot.

AB  - Abiotic and biotic factors constrain species occurrences, although many species are widely distributed. We investigated the performance of two populations of Hirtella glandulosa Spreng. (Chrysobalanaceae), a tropical tree or shrub that occurs from Venezuela to southeastern Brazil. This study was carried out in two evergreen Atlantic Forests fragments in the Chapada Diamantina Mountains (Brazil) growing on sites with different soil types and different water availabilities: a river margin on litholic soils (river/lithosol) and a plateau with the deep clayey soils (plateau/latosol). We examined leaf phenology, water potential (psi(W)), wood density, leaf traits, and leaf gas exchange of populations growing at both sites in the rainy and dry seasons. Despite differences in their psi(W) values, both populations maintained similar leaf phenological patterns. Leaf traits, psi(W), and leaf gas exchange differed spatially and temporally. The maintenance of phenological strategies conditioned by distinct leaf and gas exchange traits compensated for lower water potential levels in the river margin/lithosol site and favored the maintenance of a positive water balance and greater water use efficiency than in the plateau/latosol site. Morphological and physiological trait adjustments could allow the wide distribution of H. glandulosa in contrasting soil types with different water availabilities.

AB  - Livestock activity plays a crucial role in the Amazon region of Ecuador. However, the rapid expansion of extensive pastures has led to serious problems in the environment. Grasses, such as Panicum maximum, are widely used by producers in Orellana Province, but poor management practices have resulted in inefficient production systems, as evidenced by decreased yield. Our study demonstrates that in silvopastoral systems, resources are used very efficiently, and growing conditions are improved, leading to greater productive responses. Furthermore, we observed that guinea grass responded well in silvopastoral systems. Therefore, these plants should be managed through well-planned grazing to achieve a high yield and better chemical composition.
   Climate change has increased the interannual and seasonal variation in the average temperature and precipitation rate, which determine forage availability globally. Similar patterns of change have occurred in tropical regions, and Ecuador is no exception. This region includes other influencing factors, such as the conversion of tropical forests to extensive pastures. Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate guinea grass (Panicum maximum) cultivated under silvopastoral systems with different management strategies in both of the seasons of the study region in Ecuador (rainy season and dry season). A randomized complete block design was used for the experiment, with three repetitions and three treatments. Agronomic measures, forage production, chemical composition, animal responses, and soil properties were evaluated. Data were analyzed with the Mixed model of SAS. Differences in all evaluated parameters were observed between treatments, and silvopastoral systems (SPSs) produced better results than conventional grass monoculture. Furthermore, there was a strong seasonal effect on forage production, chemical composition, and soil properties. Therefore, management of Panicum maximum with well-planned grazing can enhance animal responses and help to retain natural resources, lowering the pressure on forests.

AB  - Efforts to improve soil health require that target values of key soil properties are established. No agreed targets exist but providing population data as benchmarks is a useful step to standardise soil health comparison between landscapes. We exploited nationally representative topsoil (0-15 cm) measurements to derive soil health benchmarks for managed and semi-natural environments across Great Britain. In total, 4587 soil organic matter (SOM), 3860 pH, 2908 bulk density (BD), and 465 earthworm abundance (EA) datapoints were used. As soil properties are sensitive to site-specific characteristics, data were stratified by habitat, soil type, and mean annual precipitation, with benchmarks defined as the middle 80 % of values in each distribution - yielding 135 benchmarks. BD and pH decreased with land management intensity (agriculture > semi-natural grasslands > woodlands > heathlands > wetlands), and vice versa for SOM and EA. Normalising benchmark ranges by medians revealed soil health indicator benchmark widths increased in the order: pH < BD < SOM < EA, while width increased with decreasing land management intensity. Arable and horticulture and improved grassland exhibited narrow benchmarks for SOM, pH and BD, yet the widest EA benchmark, suggesting additional drivers impact EA patterns. Upland wetlands had the widest BD benchmarks, important when determining carbon stocks. East Anglia currently possesses the largest proportions of atypical soils, including below typical SOM (19.2 %), above typical BD (17.4 %) and pH (39.1 %), and the smallest proportions of above typical SOM (2.4 %), and below typical BD (5.8 %) and pH (2.3 %). This is found even after land use, soil type and rainfall have been considered, underscoring how urgently soil health should be addressed here. Our benchmarking framework allows landowners to compare where their measured soil health indicators fall within expected ranges and is applicable to other biomes, national and multinational contexts.

AB  - Protecting and enhancing forest carbon sinks is considered a natural solution for mitigating climate change. However, the increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of droughts due to climate change can threaten the stability and growth of existing forest carbon sinks. Extreme droughts weaken plant hydraulic systems, can lead to tree mortality events, and may reduce forest diversity, making forests more vulnerable to subsequent forest disturbances, such as forest fires or pest infestations. Although early warning metrics (EWMs) derived using satellite remote sensing data are now being tested for predicting post-drought plant physiological stress and mortality, applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are yet to be explored extensively. Herein, we provide twenty-four prospective approaches classified into five categories: (i) physiological complexities, (ii) site-specific and confounding (abiotic) factors, (iii) interactions with biotic agents, (iv) forest carbon monitoring and optimization, and (v) technological and infrastructural developments, for adoption, future operationalization, and upscaling of UAV-based frameworks for EWM applications. These UAV considerations are paramount as they hold the potential to bridge the gap between field inventory and satellite remote sensing for assessing forest characteristics and their responses to drought conditions, identifying and prioritizing conservation needs of vulnerable and/or high-carbon-efficient tree species for efficient allocation of resources, and optimizing forest carbon management with climate change adaptation and mitigation practices in a timely and cost-effective manner.

AB  - Coastal dry tropical forests (CDTFs) are important yet vulnerable ecosystems. In this paper, we highlight the special conservation issues facing CDTFs by focusing on one variant of the type, those that occupy limestone substrate in the northeastern Caribbean. Our analysis draws largely from the coastal terrestrial broadleaf forests of the northern Bahamas, the Florida Keys, and southwestern Puerto Rico. Based on the surveys of storm surge recorded during major hurricanes during the last 50 years, we define CDTFs as coastal terrestrial broadleaf forests on ground surfaces elevated up to 5 m above sea level and occurring within 5 km of the coast. These forests are not only threatened by land-use change from urbanization but also climate-driven sea level rise (SLR) and hurricanes, which have degraded them and reduced their extent. CDTFs are distinguished from other dry tropical forests by the occasional influence of marine water incursion during periodic storms, requiring species common to these forests to have some level of salt tolerance despite experiencing well-drained, fresh water conditions during most of their life span. With precipitation being the sole freshwater source for most CDTFs, SLR and the resulting salinization in the rooting zone subjects these forests to increasingly stressful conditions. Hence, even a modest rise in sea level can push numerous imperiled and endangered species and coastal terrestrial broadleaf communities to the edge of their tolerance, causing a decline in extent or their complete disappearance. Outside of protected areas, rapid urbanization has fragmented these forests and reduced their extent, which in turn have modified the interaction between rising seas and forest function. This work emphasizes the need for refined risk assessments to be completed and for conservation measures to be enforced so that resources can be directed appropriately to prevent further loss of CDTFs.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) represents a major reservoir of stored carbon (C). However, uncertainties regarding the composition and origin of stabilized SOM hinder the implementation of sustainable management strategies.
   Here, we synthesize data on the contribution of plant- and microbial-derived compounds to stabilized SOM, i.e., aggregates and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), and review the role of environmental factors influencing this contribution. Extrapolating amino sugar concentrations in soil based on molecular stoichiometry, we find that microbial necromass accounts for similar to 50% (agroecosystems) or less (forest ecosystems) of the C stabilized within aggregates and MAOM across studies. This implies that plant biomolecules, including lipids, lignin, and sugars, might account for a substantial portion (>= 50%) of the organic matter protected by minerals and aggregates. Indeed, plant-specific sugars and lipids can each account for as much as 10% of organic C within mineral soil fractions, and most reported quantities of plant-specific lipids and lignin in mineral soil fractions are likely underestimates due to irreversible sorption to minerals. A relatively balanced contribution of plant and microbial biomolecules to stabilized SOM in aggregates and MAOM is inconsistent with recent suggestions that stable SOM is comprised mostly of microbial compounds.
   Land use and soil type appear to profoundly affect the contribution of plant and microbial compounds to stabilized SOM. Consistent with studies of bulk soils, favorable conditions for microbial proliferation in grass-lands or fertile Chernozems or Luvisols appear to increase the contribution of microbial compounds, while less favorable conditions for microbial proliferation in forest soils or Podzols/Alisols appear to favor the abundance of plant compounds in stabilized SOM. Combined with a tight link between substrate quality and the abundance of microbial compounds in stabilized SOM, and a potentially inverse relationship between substrate quality and the abundance of plant compounds, these results provide evidence that plant biomolecules might be preferentially stabilized by organo-mineral interactions in some ecosystems.
   Various areas warrant further research. For example, difficulties in distinguishing direct and indirect effects of temperature and precipitation on the composition of stabilized SOM may be overcome by long-term observational studies that include climate manipulations. Knowledge gaps in the contribution of plant and microbial compounds to stabilized SOM in soil layers below 30 cm depth may simply be closed by extending the sampling depth. Moreover, a refined focus on soil fauna, with potentially strong effects on microbial and plant compounds in stabilized SOM, will provide new insights into SOM dynamics. Future studies should quantify both microbial and plant biomolecules in mineral soil fractions to allow direct comparisons and overcome limitations in existing data. For example, because biomarker-based estimates of microbial-derived C can only indirectly estimate the maximum amount of plant-derived C, exhaustive studies of plant biomarker concentrations could be conducted, including estimates of plant-specific lipids, sugars, and lignin (and biomarkers released following mineral dissolution). Generally, more integrative studies, e.g., combining molecular and isotopic tracers of organic matter inputs with targeted sampling of mineral fractions, are required to improve knowledge of the formation and persistence of stabilized SOM.

AB  - Tree legumes such as Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth ex Walp. (Gliricidia) and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth. (Sabia) are important options to enhance drought tolerance of livestock systems and improve the diet of grazing animals. This study assessed productive and nutritional potential of Gliricidia or Sabia in a silvopastoral system (SPS) with signalgrass [Urochloa decumbens (Stapf) R.D Webster]. Treatments were the two SPS allocated in a randomized complete block (three replications). Trees were harvested four times, with 6-month intervals between harvests. Response variables included all dendrometry measurements, dry matter of tree components, chemical composition, delta N-15, delta C-13, and N derived from the atmosphere (Ndfa). Sabia had greater basal diameter (7.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 6.0 +/- 1.2 cm; P = 0.045), shaft length (7.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.5 +/- 0.2 cm; P = 0.002), Lorey's height (7.2 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.9 +/- 0.3 cm; P = 0.023), tree volume (0.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.2 +/- 0.1 m(3); P = 0.014), intermediate branches (14 +/- 0.8 vs. 8 +/- 0.8 Mg DM/ha; P = 0.004), total leaf biomass (3053 +/- 236 vs. 1829 +/- 236 kg DM/ha; P = 0.029), dry matter concentration (427 +/- 0.4 vs. 252 +/- 0.4 g/kg; P = 0.021), lignin (233 +/- 0.7 vs. 145 +/- 0.7 g/kg DM; P = 0.001), and acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (272 +/- 1.2 vs. 168 +/- 1.2 g N/kg; P = 0.004). Gliricidia presented greater crude protein (250 +/- 0.7 vs. 187 +/- 0.7 g/kg DM; P = 0.003), more enriched delta C-13 (-34 +/- 0.2 vs. -35 +/- 0.2 parts per thousand; P = 0.006), and Ndfa (65 +/- 4 vs. 47 +/- 4 %; P = 0.041). Sabia demonstrated continued growth and potential to incorporate nutrients into the soil. Gliricidia had greater potential for biological N-2 fixation. Both tree legumes have potential for use in SPS. Gliricidia is recommended when the livestock production is the major goal. Sabia is recommended when timber production is the most desirable activity.

AB  - Increasing agricultural land use intensity is one of the major land use/land cover (LULC) changes in wetland ecosystems. LULC changes have major impacts on the environment, livelihoods and nature conservation. In this study, we evaluate the impacts of investments in small-scale irrigation schemes on LULC in relation to regional development in Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. We used Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques together with interviews with Key Informants (KI) and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with different stakeholders to assess the historical development of irrigation schemes and LULC change at local and regional scales over 3 decades. Overall, LULC differed over time and with spatial scale. The main transformation along irrigation schemes was from grassland and bushland into cultivated land. A similar pattern was also found at the regional valley scale, but here transformations from forest were more common. The rate of expansion of cultivated land was also higher where investments in irrigation infrastructure were made than in the wider valley landscape. While discussing the effects of irrigation and intensification on LULC in the valley, the KI and FGD participants expressed that local investments in intensification and smallholder irrigation may reduce pressure on natural land cover such as forest being transformed into cultivation. Such a pattern of spatially concentrated intensification of land use may provide an opportunity for nature conservation in the valley and likewise contribute positively to increased production and improve livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

AB  - Knowledge concerning the processes involved in defining the boundaries between rainforests (fire-sensitive) and open formations (fire-tolerant) is essential to safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services, especially under climate change and increased anthropogenic pressure. Here, we investigated the main environmental factors involved in the co-occurrence of forest islands and humid grasslands located in a protected area in the Espinhaco Biosphere Reserve, southeastern Brazil. We used permanent plots to collect the soil variables (moisture and chemical properties) in the forest islands. For sampling in wet grasslands, we installed four lines of 30 m from the edge of the islands in different directions. Subsequently, we delimited three points on each line10 m apart, totaling 12 points per area. We also surveyed the vegetation cover before and after prescribed burns. The environmental variables were subjected to tests of means and principal component analysis. We observed higher values of potassium, sum of bases, cation exchange capacity and organic matter in soils from forest islands than in wet grasslands. Therefore, the boundaries' definition between the two vegetation types appeared to be primarily related to soil fertility and moisture gradients. After prescribed burning of the areas, no regeneration of arboreal individuals was detected near the edges of the islands. Therefore, our results suggest that forest islands are unable to expand due to well-defined edapho-climatic conditions. Thus, these environments should be a target focus for designing public conservation policies because they increase the complexity of the landscape of Campos Rupestres vegetation (mountain rocky grasslands).

AB  - The genus Carpobrotus N.E.Br. comprises several aggressive invasive species that threaten biodiversity in coastal areas worldwide. We studied the phenotypic plasticity of Carpobrotus sp. pl. invading four coastal habitats in the north-western Iberian Peninsula (coastal cliffs, disturbed areas, dunes and coastal forests). We measured morphological traits and carbon (delta 13C) and nitrogen (delta 15N) stable isotope compositions of Carpobrotus sp. pl. individuals collected in each habitat. Our results indicated that leaf carbon content (% C) and dry shoot weight were higher on cliffs and lower in mixed forests. In contrast, leaf hydration was higher in mixed forests and lower on cliffs. Leaf nitrogen content (% N) was higher in forests, which might be due to the presence of Acacia longifolia, an alien tree that accumulates N in the soil through symbiotic associations with N fixing bacteria. Differences in delta 15N showed the use of different N sources in each habitat. Values were higher in disturbed areas with greater human activity and lower on cliffs and forests. delta 13C was higher in cliffs and dunes, suggesting CAM activity where drought and salinity are more intense. Water use effi-ciency (iWUE) and delta 13C were higher on cliffs and dunes, suggesting an adaptation and high tolerance of Carpobrotus sp. pl. to unfavourable conditions such as drought or salinity in the invaded areas.

AB  - Drought is one of the most complex hydrological and climate disasters, causing damage to ecosystem structure and function. Ecosystem resilience is considered a key concept for understanding and describing the response of ecosystems to drought. Recovery time, as an important measure of resilience, has been widely used to assess ecosystem resilience to drought, but there is a deficiency in distinguishing the difference in recovery time under various drought intensities. On the basis of the existing assessment of drought resilience based on recovery time, we defined a new resilience indicator using an exponentially fitted curve to characterize the relationship between drought intensity and the corresponding recovery time, and the resilience was quantified by the curve area. Resistance represents the capacity of ecosystems to remain stable during droughts, and we quantified the resistance indicator by the ratio of the frequency of no vegetation loss during drought to drought frequencies. Our results showed that the ecosystem resilience to drought increased from arid to sub-humid regions in China's dryland, and resistance was the lowest in the semiarid region. There was a trade-off between resilience and resistance: grassland had higher resilience and lower resistance than forestland. Drought memory contributed to the high resilience in the case of high drought frequency. These findings enriched the identification of the resilience of ecosystems to drought and the relationship between resilience and resistance and drought frequency in drylands.

AB  - The Peri Lake Experimental Catchment, in Southern Brazil, is a small coastal lake (5 km(2), 7 m depth) with a total catchment area of 20 km(2). The catchment is mainly covered by subtropical Atlantic Forest. Peri Lake is a recreational destination, an important ecosystem for biodiversity preservation, and a major water supply source. Even though there is a clear social and economic relevance, the information on this ecosystem is scarce, especially regarding the dynamics of water balance and water quality. We built this observatory using a low-cost, low-technology monitoring system to estimate the major components of the water budget on what we called a critical budget. We monitor meteorology, rainfall interception in two plots, overland flow and groundwater connectivity in a representative hillslope; and streamflow and velocity are measured in several small headwater rivers mostly starting during 2015. Geographic information on topography, land cover, geology, soil characteristics and the location of all the equipment installed in the field are also provided. The data set can be used to understand rainfall interception in Atlantic forests, catchment connectivity and streamflow permanence in coastal areas, spatial patterns of baseflow, and the modelling of complex processes in the critical zone involving the interaction between surface and groundwater, that are important in coastal lake ecosystems. Besides being used for research and education, we hope this observatory built on a shoestring budget will encourage fieldwork particularly in underrepresented and underfunded regions of the world.

AB  - The study analyzes the coastline oscillations and land use and land cover (LULC) change due to the impact of the cyclone Fani in Balukhand-Konark Wildlife Sanctuary (BKWS), located in East India. In this study, two Landsat 8 images in the pre- and post-cyclone periods in 2019 were used. The transition zone discriminating land and water was calculated using normalized difference water index (NDWI) and desktop digitization. The digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS), an extension of ArcGIS, was used to model changes in the shorelines, and the net shoreline movement (NSM) was used to extract the change statistics. The vegetation damage was analyzed using the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the LULC changes were assessed using geospatial techniques. Then, LULC degradation maps were produced. The results highlight the dynamic character of the studied coastline with erosion in the flat sandy forests, and show that some areas had accretion in the northern portion. The results show that SAVI has decreased along with patches close to critical erosion points, regardless of climate trends. It was observed that the severe cyclonic storm Fani had created both ecological and physical disturbances in the sandy flat BKWS area. In the future, this study can provide important information on ecological and physical changes induced by cyclonic storms and be beneficial for restoring the biodiversity niche of this unique fragile coastal forest on the east coast of India.

AB  - In tropical forests, large, old trees (LOTs) can be considered keystone structures for provisioning unique habitats such as decaying wood, roots, cavities, and epiphytes, including those that hold water (phytotelmata). These habitats may also be stratified in vertical space, for example, root structures occur at ground level and below, whereas epiphytes occur above-ground. Canopy habitat is utilized by a diversity of amphibians, but canopy habitat may only be viable in the wet season when epiphytes and surfaces are sufficiently saturated. Here, we examine how the provisioning of microhabitats and structures by LOTs influence the horizontal, vertical, and seasonal distribution patterns of phytotelmata-breeding poison frogs. We conducted ground-to-canopy surveys over 4 years, constituting 6 seasons, in Panama and used mark-recapture techniques on a population of the yellow-bellied poison frog, Andinobates fulguritus. We found that A. fulguritus migrated vertically, tracking seasonal rainfall, and displayed strong philopatry to individual trees. Furthermore, A. fulguritus almost exclusively inhabited the largest trees at the study location, which provided disproportionately high-quality microhabitats and epiphytes compared to other trees. LOTs, and specifically Anacardium excelsum at our site, appear to serve as keystone structures with high conservation value due to their provisioning of unique habitats. We conclude that the distribution of A. fulguritus is defined vertically by the stratification of arboreal microhabitat resources, horizontally by the presence of LOTs providing the resources, and temporally by the seasonal viability of the resources.

In this study, Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer active fire data products from 2001 to 2020 have been analysed for understanding the forest fire trends and its hotspots patterns during the active fire season (February to June). About 1347 average fire counts/year were recorded in six natural vegetations with the highest number of fires observed during the year 2012 (n = 3096) and minimum in 2011 (n = 210). Mann-Kendall trends analysis for the spatial and temporal pattern of fires indicated that there is a significant increase of forest fires towards higher elevation. Forest fire hotspot analysis using fire radiative power, fire frequency, and fire density showed that Uttarakhand is the most forest fire-prone state as compared to other north-western Himalayan states. It is also revealed that the May month has a higher number of fire counts and the evergreen needle forests have higher fire frequencies amongst the forest types. The forest fires were found to be more influenced by land surface temperature as compared to rainfall. The outcomes in this study on the temporal and spatial patterns for forest fire can be used for forest fire modelling.

AB  - The Zhangcheng District is critically responsible for protecting water resources, preserving sand sources, and improving the ecological environment in Beijing. Quantitative evaluation and research on the ecosystem water supply services in this area are beneficial for developing conservation planning and establishing ecological compensation mechanisms in water conservation areas. In this paper, based on the land use, meteorological, soil, and field observation data of the research area, the InVEST water yield model is used to estimate the water supply of the ecosystem in the Zhangcheng District. The model quantitatively analyzes the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of water supply services in the basin and the influence of different topographic factors. The results show that the average supply of ecosystem water in the Zhangcheng District is approximately 45 mm, and there is a degree of spatial heterogeneity. The total water supply in the Zhangcheng District is relatively small. The water resource supply in the southwest is relatively small, the rainfall in mountainous forest areas in the southeast is high, its water supply is higher, and the supply of forest land water is relatively high. The high-value areas are mainly distributed at 1500 to 3500 m and 15 degrees similar to 40 degrees; the water supply on the sunny slope is greater than that on the shady slope. With the increase in altitude and slope, the water supply in the basin tends to increase first and then decrease.

AB  - In Algeria, the arid steppe watershed currently suffers from serious environmental problems, including land degradation, poor water resource management, soil conservation, and land cover management. This situation is manifested by several events such as soil erosion, depletion of water resources, and loss of biodiversity, which are partly related to the acceleration of the soil degradation process. In order to improve the functioning of ecosystems in these watersheds, public authorities and farmers have undertaken restoration and protection efforts through land-use planning programs. The objective of this study is to test the stability, reliability, and anti-erosion effectiveness of these anti-erosion developments that currently exist on three sites, Sfissifa, Belguered, and Ain Sefra, in the face of the exceptional extreme rainfall events recorded especially in 2007-2008 (250 mm), both on cultivated land and in pasture and forest areas. We found that the traditional techniques generally used by farmers (terraces, stone cordons, toub walls, use of manure, cultivation in tanks and on ridges) have a great positive impact on water and soil conservation at the level of the cultivated plots. In addition, the modern techniques developed by the State (torrential correction, hill retention, reforestation) have proved to be very useful for water and soil conservation on a large scale, i.e., at the level of watersheds. This combination of these two types of development is almost indispensable to ensure a very positive impact on land productivity and the reduction of the risk of degradation.

AB  - Context Key to understanding forest water balances is the role of tree species regulating evapotranspiration (ET), but the synergistic impact of forest species composition, topography, and water availability on ET and how this shapes drought sensitivity across the landscape remains unclear. Objectives Our aims were to quantify (1) the effect of forest composition and topography including elevation and hillslope gradients on the relationship between ET and water availability, and (2) whether the relationship has changed over time. Methods We used remotely sensed Landsat and MODIS ET to quantify forest ET across the Blue Ridge ecoregion of the southeastern USA. Then quantified metrics describing ET responses to water availability and trends in responses over time and assessed how these metrics varied across elevation, hillslope, and forest composition gradients. Results We demonstrated forest ET is becoming less constrained by water availability at the expense of lateral flow. Drought impacts on ET diverged along elevation and hillslope gradients, and that divergence was more pronounced with increasingly severe drought, indicating high elevation and drier, upslope regions tend to maintain ET rates even during extreme drought. We identified a decoupling of ET from water availability over time, and found this process was accelerated at higher elevations and in areas with more diffuse-porous trees. Conclusions Given the large proportion of forests on the landscape distributed across high elevation and upslope positions, reductions in downslope water availability could be widespread, amplifying vulnerability of runoff, the health of downslope vegetation, and aquatic biodiversity.

AB  - Caatinga biome, located in the Brazilian semi-arid region, is the most populous semi-arid region in the world, causing intensification in land degradation and loss of biodiversity over time. The main objective of this paper is to determine and analyze the changes in land cover and use, over time, on the biophysical parameters in the Caatinga biome in the semi-arid region of Brazil using remote sensing. Landsat-8 images were used, along with the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) in the Google Earth Engine platform, from 2013 to 2019, through spatiotemporal modeling of vegetation indices, i.e., leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation cover (V-C). Moreover, land surface temperature (LST) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in Petrolina, the semi-arid region of Brazil, was used. The principal component analysis was used to select descriptive variables and multiple regression analysis to predict ETa. The results indicated significant effects of land use and land cover changes on energy balances over time. In 2013, 70.2% of the study area was composed of Caatinga, while the lowest percentages were identified in 2015 (67.8%) and 2017 (68.7%). Rainfall records in 2013 ranged from 270 to 480 mm, with values higher than 410 mm in 46.5% of the study area, concentrated in the northern part of the municipality. On the other hand, in 2017 the lowest annual rainfall values (from 200 to 340 mm) occurred. Low vegetation cover rate was observed by LAI and V-C values, with a range of 0 to 25% vegetation cover in 52.3% of the area, which exposes the effects of the dry season on vegetation. The highest LST was mainly found in urban areas and/or exposed soil. In 2013, 40.5% of the region's area had LST between 48.0 and 52.0 degrees C, raising ETa rates (similar to 4.7 mm day(-1)). Our model has shown good outcomes in terms of accuracy and concordance (coefficient of determination = 0.98, root mean square error = 0.498, and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient = 0.907). The significant increase in agricultural areas has resulted in the progressive reduction of the Caatinga biome. Therefore, mitigation and sustainable planning is vital to decrease the impacts of anthropic actions.

AB  - The ongoing global climate change is challenging all sectors, forestry notwithstanding. On the one hand, forest ecosystems are exposed to and threatened by climate change, but on the other hand, forests can influence the course of climate change by regulating the water regime, air quality, carbon sequestration, and even reduce climate extremes. Therefore, it is crucial to see climate change not only as a risk causing forest disturbances and economic consequences but also as an opportunity for innovative approaches to forest management, conservation, and silviculture based on the results of long-term research. We reviewed 365 studies evaluating the impact of climate change on European forest ecosystems, all published during the last 30 years (1993-2022). The most significant consequences of climate change include more frequent and destructive large-scale forest disturbances (wildfire, windstorm, drought, flood, bark beetle, root rot), and tree species migration. Species distribution shifts and changes in tree growth rate have substantial effects on ecosystem carbon storage. Diameter/volume increment changed from -1 to +99% in Central and Northern Europe, while it decreased from -12 to -49% in Southern Europe across tree species over the last ca. 50 years. However, it is important to sharply focus on the causes of climate change and subsequently, on adaptive strategies, which can successfully include the creation of species-diverse, spatially and age-wise structured stands (decrease drought stress and increase production), prolongation of the regenerative period, or the use of suitable introduced tree species (e.g., Douglas fir, black pine, and Mediterranean oaks). But the desired changes are based on increasing diversity and the mitigation of climate change, and will require significantly higher initial costs for silviculture practices. In conclusion, the scope and complexity of the topic require further comprehensive and long-term studies focusing on international cooperation. We see a critical gap in the transfer of research results into actual forest practice, which will be the key factor influencing afforestation of forest stands and forest growth in the following decades. What our forests will look like for future generations and what the resulting impact of climate change will be on forestry is in the hands of forest managers, depending on supportive forestry research and climate change policy, including adaptive and mitigation strategies.

AB  - A main question in restoration of degraded forests and forest landscapes recovering from logging and fire is what to expect from natural regeneration through surviving propagules in the soil or seed sources and associated dispersal agents from the surrounding landscape mosaic, as alternative to tree planting. Tree diversity in sec-ondary forests may be high, but based on newcomer species of low wood density and long-distance, abiotic dispersal modes. We compiled and analyzed three pairs of case studies (totaling 815 plots and 11.8 ha) of sec-ondary forests recovering from logging, fire and conversion to agroforest in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) on mineral soils. Data on tree species diversity, wood density frequency distribution (indicative of successional status) and dispersal modes were compared with those of less disturbed comparator forests in the same land-scapes. Relatively undisturbed lowland dipterocarp forest in Kalimantan had close to 200 species of trees (>10 cm diameter) at a 1-ha sample scale (and 450 at a 10-ha scale). After repeated fires a sample area of 2 ha was needed to reach the same species richness. Regulation-based logging had little impact on tree species richness. In rubber agroforest with low-intensity management beyond rubber planting, 50 tree species were found at a 1-ha scale and close to 100 species in 3 ha. The Kalimantan forest after repeated fires had a markedly higher fraction of low-wood-density trees (40%), but otherwise, all forests sampled were similar in overall wood density profiles. Selectively logged forest managed by a local community (village forest) and rubber agroforest in Sumatra con-tained larger fractions of heavy-wood-density trees. The majority of trees (50%-70%) had birds, bats and primates as dispersal agents in all sites. Selectively logged forests had higher fractions of autochorous species (15%) compared to other sites. Anemochorous (wind-dispersed) species, especially Macaranga lowii, were most common (20%) in lowland dipterocarp forest. Comparison between secondary forests and agroforests showed the influence of farmer selection regarding what is allowed to grow beyond the pole stage. Wood density and seed dispersal profiles can be used as degradation indicators of species assemblages across various disturbance levels and types, as they reflect the habitat quality of the surrounding landscape mosaics.

AB  - Leaf-cutting ants of the genus Atta are widely distributed throughout the American tropics and subtropics and rival other herbivores in the consumption of surrounding foliage. Although numerous studies have been conducted on the role these insects play in herbivory and organic matter dynamics, only a handful of studies have examined their impacts on soil greenhouse gas emissions. Our study investigated fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) from three nests of Atta cephalotes using a portable greenhouse gas analyzer, and measured CO2 and CH4 emissions from soils containing nest holes that ranged 5.2-152.1 g CO2-C and -1.1 to 15,264.7 mg CH4-C m-2 day-1, respectively. Fluxes of CO2 and CH4 were positively correlated above nest holes, but not in patches of soil away from leaf-cutting ant nests. Nearby non-nest soil emissions were significantly lower, ranging from 0.6 to 6.0 g CO2-C and -1.3 to 0.77 mg CH4-C m-2 day-1. Fluxes of both gases among nests and among holes within a single nest were highly variable. This preliminary dataset is small in scale both temporarily and geographically, but the discovery of substantial greenhouse gas fluxes from Atta cephalotes nests may have important implications for carbon budgets of tropical and subtropical American forests. Further work will be necessary to determine the mechanisms behind enhanced greenhouse gas emissions from leaf-cutting ant nests, and how this may alter ecosystem-scale CO2 emissions and CH4 sink strength in tropical forest soils.

AB  - Ongoing global climate change is increasing the risk of drought stress in some areas, which may compromise forest health. Such drought events also increase outbreaks of insect herbivores, resulting in plant defoliation. Interactions between drought and defoliation are poorly understood. In a greenhouse experiment, we selected a native species, Quercus acutissima Carr. and an alien species, Quercus rubra L. to explore their physiological responses to drought and defoliation treatments. After the treatments, we determined the seedlings' physiological responses on Days 10 and 60. Our results showed that the defoliation treatment accelerated the carbon reserve consumption of plants under drought stress and inhibited the growth of both seedling types. Under the drought condition, Q. rubra maintained normal stem-specific hydraulic conductivity and normal growth parameters during the early stage of stress, whereas Q. acutissima used less water and grew more slowly during the experiment. Sixty days after defoliation treatment, the stem starch concentration of Q. acutissima was higher than that of the control group, but the stem biomass was lower. This indicates that Q. acutissima adopted a 'slow strategy' after stress, and more resources were used for storage rather than growth, which was conducive to the ability of these seedlings to resist recurrent biotic attack. Thus, Q. acutissima may be more tolerant to drought and defoliation than Q. rubra. The resource acquisition strategies of Quercus in this study suggest that the native Quercus species may be more successful at a long-term resource-poor site than the alien Quercus species.

AB  - A combined severe heatwave and drought, starting in 2018 and lasting for several months, restarted the discussion on the resistance of European beech to climatic changes, with severe growth reductions, early leaf senescence, leaf browning, and diebacks reported across Central Europe. These responses may result in long-term impacts such as reduced vitality of beech, especially under potential future drought periods. While the 2003 drought caused severe crown damage and defoliation and a loss in vitality, resulting in insect and fungal infestations and subsequent dieback, the drought in 2018 was even more severe in terms of geographical scale, duration, and intensity with reports of complete diebacks and severe mortality across Central Europe. These impacts were exacerbated in some regions by the consecutive drought in 2019 and secondary attacks from pathogens, as well as a further loss in vitality. Such enhanced drought exposure of beech trees could push them beyond their hydraulic safety margins. Moreover, growth legacy effects due to past droughts may lead to lower recovery over time, potentially leading to subsequent tree death. In order to better predict the future of beech growth and vitality in Central Europe, both short- and long-term legacy effects of defoliation and their influence on post-drought growth should be explored, and adaptive forest management strategies evaluated. Moreover, synergistic or additive interactions of legacy effects with drought, as well as with biotic disturbances, require further investigation. Long-term forest monitoring data facilitates investigations of drought responses of beech.

AB  - Global warming induced-wildfires of the 21st century reveal the catastrophic effects that widespread biomass burning has on flora and fauna. During mass extinction events, similar wildfire episodes are considered to play an important role in driving perturbations in terrestrial ecosystems. To better evaluate the record of biomass burning and potential carbon cycle feedbacks at the end-Triassic mass extinction (similar to 202 Ma; ETE), we investigated the relative abundances of a range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the delta C-13 values of regular isoprenoids and n-alkanes at key sections in the SW UK. These data reveal little evidence for intensive wildfire activity during the extinction event, in contrast to what has been reported elsewhere in European, Chinese, and Greenland ETE sections. Herein, PAHs instead reflect greater contributions from an episode of soil erosion that we attribute to Large Igneous Province (LIP) driven acid rain, and possible distal sources of smoke, suggestive of fire elsewhere in the UK/European basins. This terrestrial ecosystem perturbation is coincident with those in the marine realm, indicating ecosystem perturbations occurred across multiple habitats throughout the latest Rhaetian in the SW UK. Additionally, this geochemical approach reveals that the precursor carbon isotope excursion (CIE) routinely used in chemostratigraphic correlations is unrelated to LIP activity, but instead results from the increased input of terrestrially derived C-13-depleted plant material. Furthermore, we find the initial CIE (commonly used to mark the extinction level, but which is now known to precede the ETE) is also unrelated to biomass burning. Collectively, these data reveal that processes other than combustion of terrestrial material are important for the terrestrial phase of the ETE in the SW UK. Similar investigations are required on other ETE sections, both those in close proximity to the LIP driving the extinction and those further afield, to more clearly determine the negative effect(s) of LIPs and their geographic extent in the terrestrial realm.

AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to vegetation and land cover worldwide. The loss of vegetation as a result of climate change can alter the functions and structure of the environment and its ecological systems. In the first part of this study, Sentinel-2 data, normalised different vegetation index (NDVI), and multiple regression methods were used to examine the impacts of the climatic factors of humidity, rainfall, and air temperature on vegetation dynamics from 2015 to 2021 in Dhofar, Southern Oman. In the second part of this study, random forest regression was employed to model the relationships between the NDVI and temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil map, geology map, topographic wetness index, curvature, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to buildings, and distance to roads. The multiple regression values revealed significant associations between the spatial distributions of the NDVI and the abovementioned climatic factors. The findings also indicated an increase of 1 degrees C in air temperature fluctuations between 2018 and 2021 over all five sites, with a strong tendency over Qairoon Hairiti Mountain. The rainfall records clearly indicated an increasing tendency from 2018 to 2020 due to the impact of frequent cyclones. Therefore, the results revealed a significant increase of 0.01 in the vegetation cover trend in 2018, 2019, and 2020 along the Sadah Mountain range and the eastern part of the Jabal Qara Mountains under the areas directly impacted by the cyclone, whereas there was a decrease along the western mountain range consisting of Jabal Qara and Jabal Qamar Mountains due to the impact of warm, dry air. The results revealed that NDVI values were sensitive to heavy rainfall over Jabal Samhan Mountain. The 12 variables that influenced NDVI levels had different levels of importance. Soil types, elevation, slope, rainfall, curvature, humidity, and temperature had the highest importance, while topographic wetness index, distance to urban area, aspect, distance to roads, and geology map had the lowest. The findings provide a significant foundation for Oman's planning and management of regional vegetation, water conservation, and animal husbandry.

AB  - Soil seed banks play an important role in plant species persistence in fire-prone systems. Response to fire related germination cues often reflect historical fire regimes and can be important in maintaining ecotones between different forest types. We assessed the effects of heat and/or smoke on the soil stored seed banks across an ecotone of eucalypt to rainforest overstorey comprising wet forest, cool temperate mixed forest, and cool temperate rainforest in south-eastern Australia. Soils from five replicates of each forest type were subjected to very low (45 degrees C), low (65 degrees C) and high (90 degrees C) heat with or without two different smoke treatments: -smoke-infused vermiculite, and karrikinolide-a phytoreactive compound derived from smoke. Soils were placed in a glasshouse and germinants were identified and counted at weekly intervals. Response to fire cues was consistent among forest types despite underlying differences in the diversity of soil seed banks. There was no overall response of species richness, abundance, or composition to fire cues. Phanerophytes and ant-dispersed species with hard seed coats demonstrated positive response, and endozoochores negative response, to high heat independent of smoke. Endozoochores were concentrated (albeit at low densities) in cool temperate rainforest with no overall effect of seral affiliation on response to fire cues. Given the lack of response to karrikinolide, response to soil disturbance would most likely be associated with mechanical seed abrasion and/or exposure to increased light availability than to non-fire related production of smoke products. Forest type was a stronger determinant of floristics in the germinated soil seed bank than simulated fire related germination cues. Both smoke treatments had little influence on floristics in the germinated seed bank suggesting other, non-fire disturbances such as treefalls and soil turnover by fauna may be more important for germination for many of the species in these forest types.

AB  - The vegetation in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China is influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors and has undergone drastic changes in the past decades. The farming-pastoral ecotone is the transition zone from agriculture to animal husbandry. The ecological environment of this ecotone is complex and fragile. Most researches have primarily focused on the entire farming-pastoral ecotone, seldomly considering the differences between different ecological zones characterized by soil, climate, and biome conditions. Based on the long time series of leaf area index (LAI) data, meteorological data, and land-use dataset, this study analyzed LAI variation trends, the correlations between LAI and climate factors, and the impact of land-use type change on vegetation in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China. Moreover, this paper makes a full study of the changes of the whole study area from the perspective of the differences between different ecological zones. The results showed that over 36 years, areas with vegetation improvements were considerably larger than those with degradations. However, there were still 49.56% of the total area showing no significant vegetation change. There are differences in vegetation change and response to climate between the forest ecological zones and the grassland ecological zones. The vegetation improvement trends of the forest ecological zones were larger and more sensitive to temperature, while the vegetation improvements of the grassland ecological zones were relatively small, and were more sensitive to precipitation. Human activities promote LAI changes in areas close to the forest ecological zones. The change of land use indicates that the decrease of the overall natural vegetation area has not resulted in decreasing LAI. And there is a growing trend of woodland area in the grassland ecological zones. The study provides a theoretical basis for the management of the environment and vegetation in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China.

AB  - Traits are key for understanding the environmental responses and ecological roles of organisms. Trait approaches to functional ecology are well established for plants, whereas consistent frameworks for animal groups are less developed. Here we suggest a framework for the study of the functional ecology of animals from a trait-based response-effect approach, using dung beetles as model system. Dung beetles are a key group of decomposers that are important for many ecosystem processes. The lack of a trait-based framework tailored to this group has limited the use of traits in dung beetle functional ecology. We review which dung beetle traits respond to the environment and affect ecosystem processes, covering the wide range of spatial, temporal and biological scales at which they are involved. Dung beetles show trait-based responses to variation in temperature, water, soil properties, trophic resources, light, vegetation structure, competition, predation and parasitism. Dung beetles' influence on ecosystem processes includes trait-mediated effects on nutrient cycling, bioturbation, plant growth, seed dispersal, other dung-based organisms and parasite transmission, as well as some cases of pollination and predation. We identify 66 dung beetle traits that are either response or effect traits, or both, pertaining to six main categories: morphology, feeding, reproduction, physiology, activity and movement. Several traits pertain to more than one category, in particular dung relocation behaviour during nesting or feeding. We also identify 136 trait-response and 77 trait-effect relationships in dung beetles. No response to environmental stressors nor effect over ecological processes were related with traits of a single category. This highlights the interrelationship between the traits shaping body-plans, the multi-functionality of traits, and their role linking responses to the environment and effects on the ecosystem. Despite current developments in dung beetle functional ecology, many knowledge gaps remain, and there are biases towards certain traits, functions, taxonomic groups and regions. Our framework provides the foundations for the thorough development of trait-based dung beetle ecology. It also serves as an example framework for other taxa.

AB  - Knowledge of the trophic ecology of soil animals is important for understanding their high alpha diversity as well as their functional role in soil food webs and systems. In the last 20 years, the analysis of natural variations in stable isotope ratios (15N/14N, 13C/12C) has revolutionized our view on soil animal trophic ecology. Here, we review the state of the art of the trophic ecology of a highly abundant and diverse soil animal taxon, oribatid mites (Oribatida), investigated by stable isotope analyses. The review is based on 25 papers reporting stable isotope data of 292 oribatid mite taxa from 30 different sites. Four main findings emerged. (1) Oribatid mites cluster into six trophic groups, i.e. moss feeders, lichen feeders, primary decomposers, fungal feeders/secondary decomposers, predators/scavengers and marine algal feeders, plus one additional group, which incorporates CaCO3 in their cuticle for defence but still belongs to the fungal feeders/secondary decomposers group. (2) Of the 292 species studied 43.7% were classified as fungal feeders/secondary decomposers, 27.0% as primary de-composers and 15.7% as predators/scavengers, only few species include CaCO3 into their skeleton (6.1%), feed on lichens (4.9%), mosses (2.1%) or marine algae (0.7%). (3) In about one-third of the species studied the trophic niche was constant or varied little between sites or habitats, but in two-thirds of the species their trophic niche varied between habitats, with some species even shifting trophic levels, indicating trophic plasticity. (4) When aggregated at higher taxonomic level oribatid mite species clustered in only three instead of six trophic groups. This indicates that species within the same high level taxon often belong to different trophic groups, for example because feeding habits evolved convergently. Therefore, to accurately reflect the trophic ecology of oribatid mites their stable isotope signatures need to be analysed at species level. However, stable isotope analyses also have limitations, e.g. feeding on bacteria and fungi cannot be separated, and the same is true for feeding on ectomycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Other methods such as fatty acid, amino acid and molecular gut content analyses as well as microbiome analyses may complement stable isotope studies and resolve oribatid mite trophic niche differentiation at a higher resolution. This will contribute to a better understanding of the local coexistence of large numbers of species in soil. Finally, we provide perspectives on how to integrate microarthropods into soil food webs using stable isotope and other methods allowing deeper insight into their trophic structure.

AB  - In tropical forest ecosystems leaf litter from a large variety of species enters the decomposer system, however, the impact of leaf litter diversity on the abundance and activity of soil organisms during decomposition is little known. We investigated the effect of leaf litter diversity and identity on microbial functions and the abundance of microarthropods in Ecuadorian tropical montane rainforests. We used litterbags filled with leaves of six native tree species (Cecropia andina, Dictyocaryum lamarckianum, Myrcia pubescens, Cavendishia zamorensis, Graffenrieda emarginata, and Clusia spp.) and incubated monocultures and all possible two- and four-species combinations in the field for 6 and 12 months. Mass loss, microbial biomass, basal respiration, metabolic quotient, and the slope of microbial growth after glucose addition, as well as the abundance of microarthropods (Acari and Collembola), were measured at both sampling dates. Leaf litter diversity significantly increased mass loss after 6 months of exposure, but reduced microbial biomass after 12 months of exposure. Leaf litter species identity significantly changed both microbial activity and microarthropod abundance with species of high quality (low C-to-N ratio), such as C. andina, improving resource quality as indicated by lower metabolic quotient and higher abundance of microarthropods. Nonetheless, species of low quality, such as Clusia spp., also increased the abundance of Oribatida suggesting that leaf litter chemical composition alone is insufficient to explain variation in the abundances of soil microarthropods. Overall, the results provide evidence that decomposition and microbial biomass in litter respond to leaf litter diversity as well as litter identity (chemical and physical characteristics), while microarthropods respond only to litter identity but not litter diversity.

AB  - Forest canopies can buffer the understory against temperature extremes, often creating cooler microclimates during warm summer days compared to temperatures outside the forest. The buffering of maximum temperatures in the understory results from a combination of canopy shading and air cooling through soil water evaporation and plant transpiration. Therefore, buffering capacity of forests depends on canopy cover and soil moisture content, which are increasingly affected by more frequent and severe canopy disturbances and soil droughts. The extent to which this buffering will be maintained in future conditions is unclear due to the lack of understanding about the relationship between soil moisture and air temperature buffering in interaction with canopy cover and topographic settings. We explored how soil moisture variability affects temperature offsets between outside and inside the forest on a daily basis, using temperature and soil moisture data from 54 sites in temperate broadleaf forests in Central Europe over four climatically different summer seasons. Daily maximum temperatures in forest understories were on average 2 degrees C cooler than outside temperatures. The buffering of understory temperatures was more effective when soil moisture was higher, and the offsets were more sensitive to soil moisture on sites with drier soils and on sun-exposed slopes with high topographic heat load. Based on these results, the soil-water limitation to forest temperature buffering will become more prevalent under future warmer conditions and will likely lead to changes in understory communities. Thus, our results highlight the urgent need to include soil moisture in models and predictions of forest microclimate, understory biodiversity and tree regeneration, to provide a more precise estimate of the effects of climate change.

AB  - Mixed forests are expected to be more productive and resilient against disturbances than pure forests. However, tree to tree interactions are complex and vary depending on tree characteristics and multiple site features including soil properties. Such complexity is not normally accounted for in studies of mixing effects on tree response to drought. Here, we evaluate if neighbourhood tree identity influence soil biotic and abiotic characteristics in three mature, mixed Silver fir (Abies alba) forests. Further, we investigate the relationships between radial growth response to drought, tree characteristics (growth rate, size and competition pressure), tree neighbourhood, and soil physico-chemical and biological properties. Patterns of covariation between tree size, competition pressure, soil microbial composition, and growth recovery after drought were observed among different neighbourhood types. Slow-growing, small Silver fir trees experiencing high competitive pressure were associated with higher proportions of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in the neighbourhood, high soil C:N ratios, and showed a faster growth recovery after drought. A neighbourhood dominated by broadleaf species (mainly European beech, Fagus sylvatica) was associated with high biomass of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and low biomass of Gram-positive bacteria and Eukaryote, together with lower tree growth recovery. Therefore, coexistence with other Silver fir, Scots pine or European beech trees is associated to different covariation patterns of tree, soil and drought performance variables of the target Silver fir trees. Finally, our study remarks that combining tree, soil and neighbour variables at individual level helps to understand patterns of tree growth and growth response to drought under different stand mixtures.

AB  - Background and Aims: Anthropogenic or natural disturbances can be so strong that intervention is required to recover degraded sites. One way to facilitate the recovery is the use of native species adapted to the local environment; however, there is lack of knowledge about their performance. Additionally, the establishment of interactions with mycorrhizal fungi would contribute to greater success in survival and growth of plant species used in restoration efforts. Tecoma stans is a native shrub with potential for restoration as it is considered to be stress resistant. Therefore, in the present study we explored if the species sustained interactions with mycorrhizal fungi and a bacterium and if this impacts its growth. Methods: We established an experiment in a semi-controlled environment, seeds were germinated and the seedlings were inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi (Rhizophagus intraradices , Pisolithus arhizus and Scleroderma verrucosum) and a bacterium (Azospirillum brasilense). After six months of growth in the inoculum treatments we measured the seedling relative growth rate, we quantified root and leaf morphofunctional traits and we explored the degree of infection in the roots. Key results: We detected that all fungi infected the plants and each one had different effects in the seedling growth and in its morpho-functional traits. The inoculation with S. verrucosum had positive effects on growth, and the seedlings had larger leaves and a larger canopy, a root system of greater volume and roots of larger diameter. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the use of mycorrhizal fungi would contribute to the success of the establishment of T. stans in restoration plans, since they promote growth and characteristics that potentially allow the species to realize a greater resource capture.

AB  - Microplastic (<5 mm plastic pieces) pollution is a worldwide serious problem, particularly in terrestrial ecosystems. The presence and abundance of such contaminants in tropical areas are unknown, despite their potentially harmful effects on human health and biodiversity. Tropical lowland areas often are densely populated by humans. However, the level of microplastic contamination in human-modified tropical ecosystems remains unknown. In the tropical lowland coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico, we compared the concentration and particle size distribution of soil microplastics in five contiguous ecosystems: a neotmpical rainforest, a native savanna, two pine plantations, one with the understory removed and the other with the understory left intact, and a human-induced grassland used for cattle grazing. Micmplastic extraction was performed using the density separation and filtration method. Microplastics (only fibers and fragments) were present in the soils of all the studied ecosystems. We do not detect the presence of films and pellets. We found between 1.53 and 1.49 (g(-1)dry soil) particles of fibers and fragments. Microplastics from 150 to 500 tan were the most common, whereas those from 40 to 60 mu m were the rarest. The concentration of fibers and fragments was significantly different among the studied ecosystems, being higher in the pasture than in the tropical rainforest, the pine plantations, and the savanna, which displayed similar concentrations. Micmplastics (fibers and fragments) appear to increase as the levels of clay and sand increased. The observed high abundance of micmplastic in tropical lowland areas warrants further studies on their abundance and ecosystem impact.

AB  - This review organizes the existing and current knowledge of the ecophysiology of tropical trees, related to the processes of response to global climate change, with emphasis on water relations, due to the increase in temperature and droughts. The intertropical zone is characterized by a strip with an exuberant biodiversity. Given the current scenario of climate change, the conservation of tropical forests is of vital importance for its intervention in the global carbon cycle, in addition to providing guidelines for carrying out the necessary restoration actions in areas degraded by deforestation, being a source of carbon capture and, in turn, one of the components that will help in mitigating climate change. The methodology of information search was made because of the relevance of the topic, in pertinence with previous and current researches, which contributed solid arguments to the basic understanding of tropical trees ecophysiology. This is a very complex subject and, although there are advances, it is necessary to know the answers and adaptations that trees have developed throughout time. It was inquired to possess in context, the panorama of some species of the tropic, with respect to the mechanisms of survival and the capacity to support drastic changes in its area of distribution. From the review analysis, it can conclude that the knowledge and importance of these studies in the tropical zone is not null. However, more research are needed to know and to understand the behavior of some tropical trees of economic and ecological importance for the society and that, they will be affected by own environmental factors of their geographic region bordering on the extinction.

AB  - Soil microbes play a crucial role in a forest ecosystem. However, whether the distribution of bacteria and fungi in different forest succession stages is random or following ecological specialization remains to be further studied. In the present study, we characterized soil bacterial and fungal communities to determine their distribution preference, with different succession communities in a temperate mountain forest. The Kruskal-Wallis method was used to analyze structural differences between bacterial and fungal communities in different succession processes. The specificity of soil microbial distribution in a secondary forest was studied by network analysis. The torus-translation test was used to analyze the species distribution preference of soil microbes in different succession stages. Results showed that the species composition of soil bacteria and fungi differed significantly in different succession processes. The modularity index of fungi (0.227) was higher than that of bacteria (0.080). Fungi (54.47%) had specific preferences than bacteria (49.95%) with regard to forests in different succession stages. Our work suggests that the distribution pattern of most soil microbes in a temperate mountain forest was not random but specialized in temperate mountain forests. Different microbes showed different distribution preferences. Fungi were more sensitive than bacteria during secondary succession in a temperate mountain forest. In addition, microbc environment relations varied during secondary succession. Our results provided new insight into the mechanism through which complex soil microbial communities responded to changes in forest community succession.

AB  - An exponential rise in the atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is among the most consequential impacts of climate change in terrestrial ecosystems. Rising VPD has negative and cascading effects on nearly all aspects of plant function including photosynthesis, water status, growth and survival. These responses are exacerbated by land-atmosphere interactions that couple VPD to soil water and govern the evolution of drought, affecting a range of ecosystem services including carbon uptake, biodiversity, the provisioning of water resources and crop yields. However, despite the global nature of this phenomenon, research on how to incorporate these impacts into resilient management regimes is largely in its infancy, due in part to the entanglement of VPD trends with those of other co-evolving climate drivers. Here, we review the mechanistic bases of VPD impacts at a range of spatial scales, paying particular attention to the independent and interactive influence of VPD in the context of other environmental changes. We then evaluate the consequences of these impacts within key management contexts, including water resources, croplands, wildfire risk mitigation and management of natural grasslands and forests. We conclude with recommendations describing how management regimes could be altered to mitigate the otherwise highly deleterious consequences of rising VPD.
   Rising atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (or VPD) is one of the most widespread and significant consequences of climate warming for terrestrial ecosystems. This article reviews the mechanistic bases of these usually deleterious impacts and synthesises that information into a set of management recommendations to mitigate them.

AB  - Plant diversity is very important for maintaining the structure and function of ecosystems. Affected by climate change, it is increasingly sensitive to abiotic stresses, especially in ecologically fragile arid areas. Moreover, human activities have accelerated this process, resulting in a reduction in plant diversity. Revealing the spatial pattern and effecting mechanisms of plant diversity at the watershed level is beneficial to biodiversity conservation. Here, we analyze changes in plant diversity and its influencing factors in the desert riparian forest in the lower reaches of the Kashgar River using niche theory, interspecific association analysis, geographic information system (GIS) mapping, redundancy analysis (RDA), and structural equation modelling (SEM). We show that the niche breadth of plants varies from 0.174 to 0.451, and niche overlap ranges from 0.059 to 0.995, and Populus euphratica and Tamarix chinensis are the dominant species for improving the desert environment and maintaining the stable and ecological balance of communities. Plant diversity has spatial heterogeneity that woody plants are higher than herbaceous plants, which decreases with increasing groundwater depth and salt content. Groundwater depth was the key factor to stress plant diversity. In fact, it works by influencing soil moisture and salt content. LULC change significantly reduced plant diversity (P < 0.05) and destroyed ecosystem balance. Plant diversity and NDVI were significantly positively correlated (P < 0.01). It is useful for understanding and predicting changes in plant diversity. Therefore, the effective implementation of ecological water conveyance can promote groundwater rise, alleviate soil water shortage, reduce salt content, and promote the increase in plant diversity. In addition, reasonable control of LULC changes and improvement of vegetation cover will help maintain higher plant diversity.

AB  - The presented study focuses on the impact of deadwood on surface water run-off, which was examined under laboratory conditions. In total we performed 600 rainfall simulations with harvest residues (wood with maximum length of 1 m and maximum diameter of 7 cm) that were either fresh (collected immediately after the harvest) or old (3 years and 3 months after harvest). The research analysed the impact of different values of deadwood coverage (15%, 30%), direction of its spatial arrangement (along the contour line, along the slope, random), moisture and decay stage (fresh, old) of deadwood situated on the slope with different inclinations (1% and 25%) under different rainfall intensities (5, 20, 40, 80 and 150 mm/h) on water run-off. The obtained results confirmed the significant impact of terrain slope on water run-off. The run-off from 1% slope represented 32% of the run-off observed from 25% slope. From the point of deadwood coverage, we found the fastest run-off at the smaller coverage of 15%, while in the case of 30% deadwood coverage, the run-off was only 75% of the value for 15% coverage. Decay stage of deadwood had also a significant impact on water run-off, which was by one third lower in the case of old deadwood in comparison to fresh wood. The water run-off was the fastest in the case of the spatial arrangement of deadwood along the contour line, and the slowest in the case of randomly distributed deadwood in all directions.

AB  - The southwestern Amazon Rainforest Ecotone (ARE) is the transitional landscape between the tropical forest and seasonally flooded savannahs of the Bolivian Llanos de Moxos. These heterogeneous landscapes harbour high levels of biodiversity and some of the earliest records of human occupation and plant domestication in Amazonia. While persistent Indigenous legacies have been demonstrated elsewhere in the Amazon, it is unclear how past human-environment interactions may have shaped vegetation composition and structure in the ARE. Here, we examine 6000 years of archaeological and palaeoecological data from Laguna Versalles (LV), Bolivia. LV was dominated by stable rainforest vegetation throughout the Holocene. Maize cultivation and cultural burning are present after ca 5700 cal yr BP. Polyculture cultivation of maize, manioc and leren after ca 3400 cal yr BP predates the formation of Amazonian Dark/Brown Earth (ADE/ABE) soils (approx. 2400 cal yr BP). ADE/ABE formation is associated with agroforestry indicated by increased edible palms, including Mauritia flexuosa and Attalea sp., and record levels of burning, suggesting that fire played an important role in agroforestry practices. The frequent use of fire altered ADE/ABD forest composition and structure by controlling ignitions, decreasing fuel loads and increasing the abundance of plants preferred by humans. Cultural burning and polyculture agroforestry provided a stable subsistence strategy that persisted despite pronounced climate change and cultural transformations and has an enduring legacy in ADE/ABE forests in the ARE. This article is part of the theme issue 'Tropical forests in the deep human past'.

AB  - Kanuka (Kunzea serotina, Myrtaceae) dryland shrubland communities of the lowland plains of South Island (Te Wai Pounamu), New Zealand (Aoteoroa), contain a ground cover largely consisting of mosses, predominantly Hypnum cupressiforme. There has been no previous study of the role of mosses in this threatened habitat which is currently being restored within a contemporary irrigated and intensively farmed landscape that may be incompatible with this component of the ecosystem. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of moss ground cover on hydrology, nitrogen (N) availability and vascular plant interactions, and in relation to nutrient spillover from adjacent farmland. Experimental work was a combination of glasshouse experiments and field-based studies. Extremes of soil temperature and moisture were found to be mediated by the moss carpet, which also influenced N speciation; available N declined with moss depth. The moss layer decreased the amount of germination and establishment of vascular plants but, in some cases, enhanced their growth. Spillover of mineral nitrogen and phosphate from farmland enhanced invasion of exotic grasses which may have benefited from conditions provided by the moss carpet. Synthesis: We found the moss layer to be crucial to ecosystem functioning in these dry habitats with low nutrient substrate. However, when the moss layer is accompanied by nutrient spillover, it has the potential to increase exotic weed encroachment. Our results not only emphasize the importance of non-vascular plant inclusion in restoration schemes but also highlights the importance of mitigating for nutrient spillover.

AB  - The exploitation of nontimber forest products has been proposed as a sustainable way to exploit tropical forests, but such an opportunity remains to be examined case-by-case. We examine the impact of the intensification of the acai palm (Euterpe oleracea) management for fruit production via increments in palm clumps/stems density on the woody plant assemblages (adult and regenerating) in an estuarine forest landscape in the eastern Amazon region, Brazil. Across 30 forest stands acai stem density correlated negatively with stem density and taxonomic diversity considering both adult and regenerating woody plant assemblages, but it posed a positive effect on beta diversity via species turnover. Soil fertility and forest stand accessibility played a complementary role. Moreover, acai clump density affected the abundance of particular woody plant species, including a set of species declining before the 400-acai clump density threshold imposed by current regulation. Accordingly, acai clump density influenced the taxonomic organization of woody plant assemblages at the landscape spatial level. Finally, it is worth mentioning a group of 105 species, which were recorded across the regenerating assemblages but not in the adult assemblages. Among them, a large number of small-statured woody plant species typical from the forest understory (i.e., the shade-tolerant assemblage), such as those from Miconia, Piper, Bactris, Anonna and Geonoma genera. As intensification is still spreading it can be considered a threat to the integrity of the Amazon estuarine forest and thus questions the ecological sustainability through which the current Amazonian "black gold" is now produced.

AB  - The structure of the vegetation has a significant impact on how much runoff and sediment is produced. Choosing the right parameters to evaluate the correlations between vegetation and runoff-sediment yield, however, is fraught with uncertainty. We chose 18 vegetation plots with a range of vegetation types and structural char-acteristics for this study to investigate the applicability of various vegetation structure parameters in identify in the response relationship between vegetation and runoff-sediment yield through field artificial rainfall experi-ments. The vegetation coverage, stratified vegetation cover index (Cs), species diversity and functional diversity were among the criteria of vegetation structure. The findings revealed that: (1) There was a significant difference in the runoff start time and sediment yield differed significantly between vegetation types, with shrub com-munities having a longer start time and the lowest sediment yield; (2) The vegetation coverage of the community had a significant impact on the runoff start time and, when combined with Cs, explained 48% of the runoff start time. (3) Simpson index (D) and functional richness (FRic) significantly influenced the total runoff yield and along with Cs explained 46% of the total runoff yield. Cs, coverage and FRic also positively influenced the runoff end time, with a total explanation of 29%. Functional divergence (FDiv) had a significant negative effect on the total sediment yield. Together with coverage and Cs, FDiv explained 66% of the total sediment yield. These results demonstrated how biodiversity consideration helped to clarify connections between vegetation structure and runoff-sediment yield.

AB  - Ecological restoration projects (ERPs) are an indispensable component of natural climate solutions and have proven to be very important for reversing environmental degradation in vulnerable regions and enhancing ecosystem services. However, the level of enhancement would be inevitably influenced by global drought and rising CO2, which remain less investigated. In this study, we took the Beijing-Tianjin sand source region (which has experienced long-term ERPs), China, as an example and combined the process-based Biome-BGCMuSo model to set multiple scenarios to address this issue. We found ERP-induced carbon sequestration (CS), water retention (WR), soil retention (SR), and sandstorm prevention (SP) increased by 22.21%, 2.87%, 2.35%, and 28.77%, respectively. Moreover, the ecosystem services promotion from afforestation was greater than that from grassland planting. Approximately 91.41%, 98.13%, and 64.51% of the increased CS, SR, and SP were contributed by afforestation. However, afforestation also caused the WR to decline. Although rising CO2 amplified ecosystem services contributed by ERPs, it was almost totally offset by drought. The contribution of ERPs to CS, WR, SR, and SP was reduced by 5.74%, 32.62%, 11.74%, and 14.86%, respectively, under combined drought and rising CO2. Our results confirmed the importance of ERPs in strengthening ecosystem services provision. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative way to understand the influence rate of drought and rising CO2 on ERP-induced ecosystem service dynamics. In addition, the considerable negative climate change impact implied that restoration strategies should be optimized to improve ecosystem resilience to better combat negative climate change impacts.

AB  - Pathogen dynamics in agroforestry systems result from several mechanisms and interactions whose independent effects are difficult to delineate. In recent decades, it has been shown that shade, as a structural feature in agroforestry systems, influences the spread of pathogens through its physical and biological effects. In Cameroon, citrus trees are mainly grown in cocoa-based agroforestry systems (CBAS), and are threatened by a variety of pathogens. This study examines how shading modifies the microclimate in the local environment of citrus trees in CBAS, and the resulting effect on citrus foot rot disease (PFRD). The study was conducted in the Cameroon agroecological zone with bimodal rainfall, where a network of 20 CBAS plots was established. Primary cartographic and structural data were used to perform static simulations with cumulative shadow overlay in ShadeMotion software. A soil sensor was used to quantify the microclimate by measuring air temperature and relative humidity above and in the soil, as well as soil pH. Relationships between shade rate, microclimatic variables, and PFRD intensity were investigated. Results showed that the effect of temperature on PFRD was independent of shade rate. A dependency relationship between relative humidity above and in the soil and PFRD according to shade rate was found. Indeed, a positive correlation of PFRD with relative humidity was observed for citrus trees located in full sunlight, while a negative correlation was observed for citrus trees located under dense and light shade. Optimization of structural characteristics of CBAS would allow ecological management of PFRD and reduction in the use of chemical pesticides.

AB  - Dispersal limitation and environmental filtering were recognized as the main dispersal-based and niche-based processes responsible for community assembly. These interactions usually leave more spatial signatures in sapling communities and create detectable spatial patterns in different functional types of species. We investigated saplings of pioneer and non-pioneer species, which facilitated an understanding of species co-existence and biodiversity recovery. Based upon mapped tree data in the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest dynamics plot in Taiwan, we endeavored to: (1) determine the different spatial scales contributing to distribution patterns of pioneer and non-pioneer saplings; (2) understand how dispersal limitation affects distribution of pioneer and non-pioneer saplings; and (3) evaluate the degree to which the different environmental factors explain variation in species composition in pioneer and non-pioneer saplings. We used the principal coordinates of neighbor matrices (PCNM) method, and variation partitioning to disentangle the contributions of these processes. Fine-scale spatial patterns were more important for pioneer than for non-pioneer saplings. Dispersal limitation was the main process influencing the spatial distribution of the non-pioneer saplings. Environmental filtering was also an important process regulating the spatial distribution of saplings for both functional types, especially for pioneer saplings. Disturbance effects contributed to fine-scale spatial variation in pioneer saplings, whereas topographic and soil effects contributed to broad and medium scale spatial variation in non-pioneer saplings. It was evident that different spatial patterns of saplings of different functional types served to facilitate tree regeneration and maintain species co-existence in this subtropical broad-leaved forest.

AB  - The article examines the prospects of Ukraine on the world grain market and ways to increase the efficiency of maize cultivation using environmentally safe technologies in the conditions of the negative impact of climate change and other stress factors. The methodological approach takes into account the peculiarities of agrarian production based on the use of data of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, United States Department of Agriculture, United Nations, Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food of Ukraine and State Statistics Service of Ukraine. The dynamics of world production and export of maize grain, sown areas, production and yield of maize in Ukraine are demonstrated, which directly focuses attention on the competitiveness of Ukrainian maize on the world grain market. These arguments are confirmed by analytical results, which show that in 2022, among the world leaders of maize grain producers, Ukraine took fifth place, and among exporters - fourth. In order to mitigate the impact of climate change and other stress factors on the effective production and export of Ukrainian maize, adaptation measures are proposed, which consist in the application of modern technologies, which include: optimization of the structure of sown areas and scientifically based crop rotations with the effective use of competitive varieties and hybrids of agricultural crops, the introduction of organic and mineral fertilizers and plant protection products, the use of soil protective tillage, sideration and mulching, irrigation systems, and also the productive use of plant residues with the application of modern biodestructors. Their comprehensive implementation will contribute to the development of maize yield, grain quality, preservation of biodiversity and the solution of the grain-food problem in the world.

AB  - Although the Brazilian Atlantic Forest is a hotspot for biodiversity conservation, it is one of the most fragmented biomes in Brazil and also affected by air pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The study aimed at measuring the PAH levels in leaf trees, litter, soil, and atmosphere of two Atlantic Forest remnants impacted by air pollutants during summer and winter periods; identifying emission sources; and investigating the relationship among the PAH concentrations in the soil, litter, leaves, and atmosphere. Site 1 is situated in the largest South American city, with rainy summers and dry winters, and characterized by intense urbanization. Site 2 is situated in a large forest continuum and is characterized by wet climate with no defined dry seasons. It is more distant from the anthropogenic urban sources than site 1, but closer to an industrial complex. No differences were detected for PAH amounts (summer + winter) in the particles and wet deposition fluxes between sites. In site 1, the highest concentrations of PAHs in the particles were measured during the winter while in the leaf trees were measured during the summer. PMF model showed that sites 1 and 2 receive PAHs mainly from vehicle emissions and industrial activities, respectively. The accumulation of heavier compounds in soil and leaves via wet deposition was more evident in site 2. PAHs were mainly stored in the soil of site 1, contrasting with site 2, where they were retained in litter, which were attributed to disturbances of decomposer community and reduced decomposition rates.

AB  - Trema orientale (L.) Blume is an important medicinal plant with multiple applications for treating several disease conditions. This study compiled published data on botanical, traditional uses, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and antimicrobials, coupled with discussing the conservation and domestication potential of T. orientale. Data were sourced from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Elsevier Plants of the World Online (Kew Science), Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and World Flora Online (WFO), using key search terms: Trema orientale or orientalis, phytochemistry pharmacology, taxonomy, and domestication with Boolean operators to include and exclude articles for the review. The review indicated that molecular studies have shown that T. orientale is closely related to a sister group of Cannabis through plastome phylogenetic evidence which accounts for its transfer from Ulmaceae to the Cannabaceae family. T. orientale is distributed across several African countries and has recently been assessed as the Least Concern by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Nevertheless, deforestation continues to pose an extinction risk to their population. Currently, 31 compounds have been isolated from different parts of T. orientale justifying many traditional uses accredited to it. T. orientale is considered a dose-dependent safe remedy for the treatment of infectious diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other disease conditions ascribed to it except for its continuous application. This review underscores the domestication potential of T. orientale including evidence of molecular markers, soil seed banks, and promising outcomes of germination experimentations. This, therefore, presents significant gains toward sustainable utilization of Trema orientale.

AB  - Natural forests and stands subjected to little to moderate human impact are continuously declining worldwide and with these, their biodiversity and ecosystem services. Many Nothofagus forests in the south of the South American continent are in a pristine state or only moderately impacted by humans. Forest grazing by livestock, in the past and still today often practiced in a non-sustainable way is, however, increasingly under discussion to meet current environmental and socio-economic challenges. Accordingly, we investigate the regeneration of Nothofagus dombeyi, a keystone species of the Patagonian Andes, in secondary forests in Argentinian northern Patagonia, particularly addressing the role of disturbance through grazing by livestock at various intensities. We test the hypothesis that the regeneration of this tree species is favored by grazing impact and, thus, disturbance of the herb layer and soil surface. In support of our hypothesis, Nothofagus dombeyi regeneration was significantly higher in terms of individuals and height classes in moderately grazed forests. Multivariate analysis shows significant positive effects of moderate grazing pressure, herb layer cover, and the occurrence of bare soil on the regeneration of Nothofagus dombeyi. Our results show that an integration of livestock grazing and forest regeneration is possible and that agroforestry systems can be an adequate management option for stakeholders in the region. A grazing management can also be part of a forest fire prevention strategy. However, the regeneration success and grazing pressure should be continuously monitored.

AB  - Hotter droughts are becoming a major threat to forest growth in water-limited regions. Species interactions have long been acknowledged as an important component modulating ecosystem functions, including mediating their vulnerability to climate-related stresses. However, quantifying the impact of species interactions on forest growth in response to drought remains a challenge. Using the tree ring data of two species in two pure forests and two coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests with different degrees of mingling in southern Siberia within the period of 1960-2017, we found that mixed forests with higher mingling have a higher ability to withstand the effect of extreme drought events, which is especially beneficial to the resistance and resilience of broad-leaved trees. Larch trees showed a remarkable consistency in their resistance and resilience to extreme drought events in both pure and mixed stands, suggesting their ability to promote the growth of neighboring white birch without reducing their own growth. The growth of white birch trees was enhanced in mixed forests and showed a significant trend of increasing resistance and resilience with increasing mingling. Our results provide further evidence of a decreasing duration of the legacy effect with increasing mingling for both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, which might explain the improved tolerance to drought of trees in mixed forests compared to those in pure forests in water-limited hemiboreal southern Siberia. Our study implies that changes in forest structure might help forests respond to hotter droughts in water-limited regions.

AB  - Drought is a widespread hazard that can tremendously affect the biodiversity, habitat of wild species, and ecosystem functioning and stability, especially in the dry region. Due to its geographic location, the north-western region of Bangladesh has a comparatively arid climate which is very much susceptible to drought occurrence and is marked as a red zone. Despite the growing evidence of the impact of drought on food security and ecosystem functioning, little effort has been paid to mitigate the drought in this region. The present study aimed to assess the drought condition of the north-western region of Bangladesh using earth observation techniques. For this purpose, Landsat data from 1990 to 2020 was used to determine various vegetation indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Water Index (NDWI), Moisture Index (NDMI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), along with Land Surface Temperature (LST). Results show that the depletion of forests (2832 km2) and water bodies (6773 km2) resulted from the expansion of settlement (6563 km2) and agricultural land (1802 km2) for the period 1990-2020. Examination of the temporal changes of vegetation indices and LST showed that the values of all indices decreased while the LST increased. The negative correlation between NDVI value and LST indicates that the vegetation in our study was subject to drought-induced shocks. This study reveals the current situation of the vegetation health in the north-western region of Bangladesh in relation to the drought conditions. The findings of this study have practical implications for the policymakers in implementing necessary measures for agriculture, forests, water development, and economic zone planning.

AB  - China's Sloping Land Conversion Programme (SLCP) improves the vegetation at the expense of a lot of water and aggravates the drought in arid and semi-arid regions. Identifying vegetation restoration types based on their ecological effectiveness is important for alleviating the conflicting demands for water between the ecosystem and humans. This study used the treatment effect model to estimate the marginal contribution of SLCP towards vegetation restoration in the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau. Additionally, we built a relative advantage index (RAI) for identifying vegetation restoration types based on the assessment of SLCP's ecological effectiveness. After implementing the SLCP, land use experienced significant transitions, and the vegetation was extensively improved in the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau. The farmland changed into forestland and grassland extended to over 985.608 km2 and 3021.526 km(2) respectively, and the average normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) increased by 35.818 % from 2000 to 2015. The SLCP has a large positive effect on vegetation, and the marginal contribution of conversion farmland to forest (CFF) is higher than that of conversion farmland to grassland (CFG). Furthermore, the RAI can effectively distinguish vegetation restoration types in forest-grass transition zones. The suitable afforestation areas with a RAI of more than 1 account for 14.101 %, and are mainly distributed in the south of the Northern Shaanxi Plateau while others are more suitable for grass-planting. The government should improve schemes to guide farmers to choose the appropriate vegetation restoration types in different areas for gaining more ecological profits.

AB  - The seasonal rainforests distributed across the tropical karst hills of south China are of high biodiversity conservation value and serve many important ecosystem functions. However, knowledge surrounding distribution patterns of woody plants in tropical karst hills remains limited. In this study, we surveyed the distribution of families, genera and species of woody flora at four slope positions (depression, lower slope, middle slope, and upper slope), and analyzed the influence of topographic and soil variables on the distribution of woody plants in the tropical karst hills of south China. Forty forest plots (each 20 m x 20 m) contained 306 species of woody plants with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 1 cm, representing 187 genera and 66 families. As slope increased, the number of families increased slowly, and the number of genera and species followed a concave-shaped trend, with the lowest number of genera and species in the lower slope position. Differences in species composition were significantly stronger between slope positions than within slope positions. The topographic and soil variables explained 22.4% and 19.6%, respectively, of the distribution of woody plants, with slope position, slope degree, soil potassium and soil water content as the most significant variables. The results of generalized linear mixed model analysis showed that total R2 of fixed effects on variation of woody species richness was 0.498, and rock outcrop rate and soil total phosphorus were the best fitting effects. Our results help to explain the community assembly mechanism and to inform management and protection strategies for species-rich seasonal rainforests in the karst area.

AB  - 1. Current anthropogenic disturbances have changed natural environments, broadly impacting ecosystem services and functions. Here, the authors focused on the secondary dispersal of diaspores by ants, which serve an important ecological function in the natural regeneration of degraded habitats.2. The authors experimentally studied the effects of vegetation suppression and soil disturbance on (i) diaspore removal, (ii) the quality of secondary removal, and (iii) the structure of interaction networks between ants and diaspores. The authors tested whether the disturbance affected the species richness of seed removers, diaspore removal rate, removal distance and time, and removal effectiveness. Additionally, the authors tested whether the structure of ant-diaspore networks, that is, specialisation, modularity and robustness, is altered by soil disturbance. To do that, the authors studied three degraded and three preserved areas in the Brazilian Cerrado.3. The authors observed 25 ant species interacting with the diaspores. Disturbance did not affect ant species richness, removal distance or removal rate, but ants took twice as long to remove the diaspores in the preserved habitat. The frequency of interaction networks was higher in the preserved habitat, and the effectiveness of species in removing the diaspores differed between habitats. Surprisingly, the authors observed that ants considered effective dispersers mostly occurred in degraded habitats, highlighting the potential of myrmecochory in the regeneration of impacted environments.4. The findings point to the potential of ants in acting as secondary seed dispersal, improving the restoration of areas highly impacted by soil disturbance. Moreover, this study contributes to understanding the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on ecological interactions and ecosystem functions.

AB  - Environmental changes caused by edge effects and matrix land use can interfere with plant community resilience and, consequently, alter forest succession. Here, we aimed to (i) investigate whether species composition, density and richness in a forest's regeneration layer vary in its edge-to-interior gradient and (ii) analyze the relationship between regeneration and local abiotic variables. We conducted the study in the lowland rainforest of the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot at the Corrego Grande Biological Reserve, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. We sampled the regeneration layer in two edge environments with different matrices (forest and road) and the fragmented interior to link vegetation structure with environmental variables. In each environment, we set up 12 plots of 5 x 10 m size and recorded, in each plot, the height and stem base diameter of all living individuals above 50 cm of height and below 2.5 cm of diameter at breast height (1.30 m height). We applied different multivariate analyses to assess the influence of environmental data, such as canopy openness and physical-chemical soil variables. The three environments shared 22 out of the 174 morphospecies recorded, and the forest-side edge had the lowest species richness among all environments. The environmental variables that better explained the distribution of species across the three environments were: canopy openness, soil penetration resistance, zinc, and calcium content. Our results revealed significant environmental differences among the forest edges and the forest interior of the study site, highlighting the relevant role of the forest surrounding matrix for the maintenance of protected remnants.

AB  - Tropical forests are some of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world, yet their functioning is threatened by anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. Global actions to conserve tropical forests could be enhanced by having local knowledge on the forests & apos; functional diversity and functional redundancy as proxies for their capacity to respond to global environmental change. Here we create estimates of plant functional diversity and redundancy across the tropics by combining a dataset of 16 morphological, chemical and photosynthetic plant traits sampled from 2,461 individual trees from 74 sites distributed across four continents together with local climate data for the past half century. Our findings suggest a strong link between climate and functional diversity and redundancy with the three trait groups responding similarly across the tropics and climate gradient. We show that drier tropical forests are overall less functionally diverse than wetter forests and that functional redundancy declines with increasing soil water and vapour pressure deficits. Areas with high functional diversity and high functional redundancy tend to better maintain ecosystem functioning, such as aboveground biomass, after extreme weather events. Our predictions suggest that the lower functional diversity and lower functional redundancy of drier tropical forests, in comparison with wetter forests, may leave them more at risk of shifting towards alternative states in face of further declines in water availability across tropical regions.
   A dataset of 16 plant traits sampled from 2,461 individual trees from 74 tropical forest sites around the world is used to show a strong link between climate and plant functional diversity and redundancy, with drier tropical forests likely being less able to respond to declines in water availability.

AB  - Increasing durations and frequencies of droughts under climate change endanger the sustainable functioning of forests worldwide. The admixture of species with complementary resource use may increase the resilience of forests towards drought; however, little is known about modifications of species interactions (i.e. facilitation and competition) by increasing drought severity in mixed forests. In particular, knowledge on the regulation of central ecohydrological processes, such as tree water fluxes, is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a literature review to assess the impact of species interactions on tree resilience (resistance + recovery) under increasing drought severity. The classification of studies into three drought classes suggested that beneficial species interactions, i.e. through improved water relations, were prevalent under mild droughts. However, with increasing drought, negative effects, such as interspecific competition, occurred. These negative interactions were prominent under extreme droughts, where even trees with complementary resource-use strategies competed for water resources. Fewer data are available on recovery of water fluxes. The limited evidence supported the patterns observed for drought resistance, with facilitation and complementarity of species in mixtures enhancing tree recovery after moderate droughts. However, after extreme droughts, competition effects and reduced recovery for some species were observed, which can strongly compromise tree resilience. While we acknowledge the importance of mixed forests for biodiversity, ecosystem services or pest resistance, we caution that beneficial species interactions may shift under extreme droughts. Thus, there is an urgent need to investigate species interaction effects on resilience in more depth to adapt forest trees to increasing drought stress.

AB  - Plant phenology describes the timing of reproductive events including flowering and fruiting, which for many species are affected by fire disturbance. Understanding phenological responses to fire provides insights into how forest demographics and resources may shift alongside increasing fire frequency and intensity driven by climate change. However, isolating the direct effects of fire on a species' phenology and excluding potential confounders (e.g. climate, soil) has been difficult due to the logistical challenges of monitoring species-specific phenological events across myriad fire and environmental conditions. Here, we use CubeSat-derived crown-scale flowering data to estimate the effects of fire history (time since fire and fire severity over a 15-year time span) on flowering of the eucalypt Corymbia calophylla across a Mediterranean-climate forest (814 km2) in southwest Australia. We found that fire reduced the proportion of flowering trees at the landscape-scale, and flowering recovered at a rate of 0.15 % (& PLUSMN;0:11% SE) per year. Further, this negative effect was significant due to high crown scorch fires (>20% canopy scorch), yet there was no significant effect from understory burns. Estimates were obtained using a quasi-experimental design which identifies the effect of time since fire and severity on flowering by comparing proportional flowering within target fire perimeters (treatment) and adjacent past fire perimeters (control). Given the majority of fires studied were managed fuel reduction burns, we applied the estimates to hypothetical fire regimes to compare flowering outcomes under more or less frequent prescribed burning. This research demonstrates the landscape-scale effects of burning on a tree species' reproduction, which could broadly impact forest resiliency and biodiversity.

AB  - Nutrient cycling in cocoa agroforestry systems (cAFS) is complex and poorly understood. To better understand the mass flow of carbon and nutrients into the soil sub-system under various contexts we quantified the mass flow of litterfall, its composition and seasonal variations in different agroforestry systems in Bokito (Central Cameroon). We studied litterfall dynamics and in situ leaf-litter cycling of cAFS established on past forest lands (F-cAFS) and savannah (S-cAFS). We also studied the decomposition of cocoa and associated tree leaf-litter in litterbags. Local secondary semi-deciduous forests were included as control. Annual litterfall in full-grown cAFS (> 15 years old) was high (9.4 Mg ha(-1) y(-1)) and represented ca. 67% of litterfall in control forests. In full-grown cAFS, associated tree leaf-litter contributed to litterfall the most and ranged between 60 and 70% of the total amount recorded (6.3 Mg ha(-1) y(-1)). The quantities and dynamics of the litter components monitored were similar in full-grown S- and F-cAFS. The microclimate was best buffered in forests and least buffered in young S-cAFS but could not be linked to leaf-litter decomposition. Forest leaf litterfall was higher and tended to cycle faster than total leaf-litter of cAFS, whose decomposition appeared limited by cocoa leaf-litter quality. Our study underlines (i) the critical contribution of associated trees to the nutrient cycle of agroecosystems established on poor soils and, (ii) the ability of farmers to channel associated tree communities towards similar functioning despite different past land-uses.

AB  - Shelterbelts proved to be important structures that provide water preservation and wind protection for humans, their activities, and crops but they also promote biodiversity, by providing a diversity of habitats for wildlife, contributing to a natural balance of harmful and useful species, and promoting biological control of pests. Shelterbelts were used since the 17th century, but their extensive use begin in the 19th century, following numerous scientific studies that proved their beneficial effects on soil and environment. As climatic and soil conditions are very specific for different regions, the impact of these factors on plants used to build the shelterbelts must be carefully analyzed prior to shelterbelts installation. The southern and southeastern plains of Romania are the regions most affected by climate change, especially drought. Because the area is outspread, with a very diverse soil cover, classified in different soil classes as cernisols (typical chernozem), luvisols (preluvosol), hydrisols (gleiosol), protisols (alluvial), etc., soil surveys are mandatory. In the present paper we try to highlight the importance of determining the soil suitability for the establishment of shelterbelts, especially for those agricultural lands prone to frequent droughts, as those in steppe areas of the Roman Plain. Soil profiles were opened, and surveys were performed, the soil being characterized morphologically and physico-chemically. For each type of soil, the soils were divided according to the main criteria for grouping the lands according to the forest suitability as: soil volume, soil thickness up to compact rock, skeleton content, texture, compaction, salinization / alkalization, humus content, slope category, surface and depth erosion, landslides, groundwater level, etc. The current study may be a model for the suitability of land in lowland areas frequently affected by drought, with similar physical and geographical conditions.

AB  - This study analyzes the Amazon rainforest in the Brazilian state of Rondonia from the perspective of the forest regeneration observed from 2008 to 2018. The research examines the regeneration's contribution to the landscape's morphological spatial pattern within the state's geographical limits, conservation units, indigenous lands, and the unprotected region. It assesses how the increase of forest regeneration areas influences morphological spatial patterns and evaluates whether the landscape in Rondonia has benefited from these new areas. The GuidosToolbox software was used to extract the morphological spatial pattern and the indices of morphological spatial patterns of forest habitats. The findings showed that Rondonia developed forest regeneration areas for 10 years, but these areas contributed little to improving the landscape morphological spatial patterns. The increase in regeneration areas contributed adequately only in the unprotected region. Therefore, the forest regeneration was not enough to compensate for the observed deforestation. Thus, conservation actions must be complemented with restoration activities focused on reconnecting patches and increasing the size of forest habitat through projects to encourage environmental regularization of exploited areas. Study Implications: The state of Rondonia reflects what is happening in the Brazilian Amazon, with high levels of deforestation and forest regeneration in abandoned areas after anthropic use. The emergence of new forest areas contributes to reducing the effects of anthropization on forest habitat fragments. However, forest regeneration alone is insufficient to ensure that the landscape has substantially recovered. In-depth analyses, such as morphological spatial pattern analysis, can provide a broader view to affirm that regenerated forest areas are growing in a region while enriching forest habitat fragments and resulting in ecological benefits.

AB  - To study the influences of gap size on the variation in soil nutrients, soil microbial carbon (micro-C), soil samples from Pinus massoniana forests were collected in and around different forest gaps with size ranging from 40.38 to 1321.40 m2 in Guizhou Province. The soil nutrients (include SOC, TP, TK, TKN, valid-P, valid-K and hydro-N) and micro-C in soil samples were analyzed, and the artificial neural networks was employed to explore the importance of different soil nutrients and gap size concerning micro-C. The results indicate that the micro-Cgap value of 221.24 mg kg-1, and the micro-Cforest ranged from 110.70 to 685.62 mg kg-1 with a mean value of 356.16 mg kg-1. The micro-Cgap/micro-Cforest values increased with the increase of gap size in the range from 40 to 600 m2, and this trend inversed when gap size was greater than 600 m2. Micro-C was mainly associated with valid-P for both gaps and surrounding forests, large gap may lead to the loss of soil N. The results suggested that: (a) SOC, TK, TKN, hydro-N and valid-P are important factors to microbial in forest soils; (b) TP, valid-K, TKN, TK, valid-P and SOC are important factors to microbial in gap soils. In summary, gaps can increase the heterogeneity of soil nutrients and soil microbial, valid-P is a key factor affecting microbial abundance for Pinus massoniana forest. These promote the preservation of biodiversity and pedodiversity.

AB  - Plant phenology is rarely considered when selecting species used in restoration actions. However, considering the potential flowering and fruiting phenologies of species is a key point to: (1) evaluate the capacity of restoration actions in reestablishing ecological interactions (pollination and seed dispersal) and ecosystem functions (early germination and plant establishment to reduce soil erosion); (2) determine which species are most suitable to the target site, and (3) identify when and where locally adapted seeds can be harvested and purchased. Here, we evaluate the potential reproductive phenology of species occurring in restored and forest fragments in Southeastern Brazil. We asked whether flowering and fruiting phenological patterns differed among type areas. For such, we compared 14 restored areas and 18 nearby forest fragments and compiled phenological data from the literature for 267 species (84% of species sampled). Despite their low floristic similarity, restored and forest fragments showed close similarity of general potential flowering and fruiting periods year-round, peaking in the dry-to-rainy season. There were only slight differences in seasonality of two out of the eight parameters evaluated. Nonzoochorous species' fruiting was seasonal, while zoochorous species fruiting onset occurred year-round but was slightly seasonal in forest fragments. Comparing potential phenological patterns between restored and forest fragments using a compilation from secondary sources are unprecedented in Brazil at this scale. Our results highlight that applying phenological information, even from literature, is essential to improve the science and practice of future restoration actions, enhancing the likelihood of successful restoration of ecosystem functions and species interactions.

AB  - Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L. Moench) is a beneficial vegetable and oil crop that has found valuable use as food, paper, medicine, and oil. However, because of climate change, a lack of better okra cultivars that can resist drought has hampered okra production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and across the world. This study aimed to investigate the economic production of this vegetable in a forest setting. The okra (A. esculentus L.) experiment was conducted underneath three forest trees (i.e. Albizia lebbeck, Melia azedarach, and Leucaena leucocephala) in the agroforestry area. A single-factor Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications was utilised. The sample was then separated into three groups: okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry, okra-M. azedarach agroforestry, and okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The findings of the study revealed that okra production had differed significantly in three agroforestry practices. The fresh okra yield was highest (10.20 ton/ha) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry. The okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry (9.10 ton/ha) came in second, while the lowest yield was in the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry (8.90 ton/ha). Moreover, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry recorded the maximum benefit-cost ratio (3.97) for economic performance. This ratio was 21% and 14% higher compared to the respective performance of the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry and okra-L. leucocephala agroforestry. However, the highest amount of carbon sequestration (238.90 ton/ha/yr) was measured in the okra-M. azedarach agroforestry as well as (229.80 ton/ha/yr) in the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry practice. Finally, the okra-A. lebbeck agroforestry practice would significantly increase production, touching financial benefit and ensuring sound environmental quality using the vacant woodlot space.

AB  - Determining how fully tropical forests regenerating on abandoned land recover characteristics of old-growth forests is increasingly important for understanding their role in conserving rare species and maintaining ecosystem services. Despite this, our understanding of forest structure and community composition recovery throughout succession is incomplete, as many tropical chronosequences do not extend beyond the first 50 years of succession. Here, we examined trajectories of forest recovery across eight 1-hectare plots in middle and later stages of forest succession (40-120 years) and five 1-hectare old-growth plots, in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM), Panama. We first verified that forest age had a greater effect than edaphic or topographic variation on forest structure, diversity and composition and then corroborated results from smaller plots censused 20 years previously. Tree species diversity (but not species richness) and forest structure had fully recovered to old-growth levels by 40 and 90 years, respectively. However, rare species were missing, and old-growth specialists were in low abundance, in the mid- and late secondary forest plots, leading to incomplete recovery of species composition even by 120 years into succession. We also found evidence that dominance early in succession by a long-lived pioneer led to altered forest structure and delayed recovery of species diversity and composition well past a century after land abandonment. Our results illustrate the critical importance of old-growth and old secondary forests for biodiversity conservation, given that recovery of community composition may take several centuries, particularly when a long-lived pioneer dominates in early succession.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Roadkill is one of the principal causes of the loss of biodiversity around the world. The effects of roads on mammals are still poorly understood in regions with a semi-arid climate, where many knowledge gaps persist. The present study provides an inventory of the mammalian species affected on highways in northeastern Brazil, as well as identifying roadkill hotspots and contributing to the understanding of how seasonality and the landscape may influence the roadkill patterns of wild mammals. A total of 6192.52 km of road were sampled in 53 field surveys conducted between 2013 and 2017. Landsat 8 satellite images and data from the MapBiomas platform were used to classify land use and cover for analysis. Buffers of 1 km, 5 km, and 10 km were created around the study roads to identify the landscape variables associated with roadkill events. Ripley's 2D K-Statistics and the 2D HotSpot test were used to identify roadkill aggregations and hotspots; GLMMs were generated for the landscape variables and evaluated using the Akaike Information Criterion. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to investigate the potential effects of seasonality. A total of 527 wild animal carcasses were recorded as a result of vehicular collision. The species with the highest roadkill records were Cerdocyon thous, Euphractus sexcinctus, and Procyon cancrivorus, while two species-Leopardus emiliae and Herpailurus yagouaroundi-are considered to be under threat of extinction. For mammals in general, the best GLMM indicated an increase in roadkills with increasing density of local vegetation areas, and a decrease as urban areas increased. The model also found that the mammals were less impacted in the vicinity of a protected area. In the specific case of C. thous, the roadkill rate was lower when urban infrastructure was more common than dense vegetation; the rate increased as areas of dense vegetation increased. In the case of P. cancrivorus and E. sexcinctus, the best models of roadkill patterns included an area of exposed soil and sparse vegetation, respectively. Roadkill rates were higher in the rainy season for all the mammals, with the exception of C. thous. These results reflect the ecological characteristics of the species with the highest roadkill rates. The findings of the present study raise concerns with regard to the impact of highways on the populations of C. thous, as well as the region's most threatened species. They also indicate the potential functionality of the local protected area, as well as identifying roadkill hotspots, which will support the development of effective mitigation measures.

AB  - Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystems on the Earth. During natural succession, a quite known pattern of changes occur (i.e., the process of a gradual assemblage of plant species and associated organisms best adapted to the current habitat conditions). Much less is known about novel ecosystem establishment's primary spontaneous successional mechanisms due to human agency such as post-coal mine heaps habitats. The post-coal mine heaps are sites of pure mineral substrates and constrain (e.g., temperature, acidity, drought, salinity) habitat conditions. These conditions are variable both in time and space. Regardless of all these constraints, diverse vegetation is soon spontaneously developing on these sites. A characteristic feature of the vegetation successional development on post-coal mine heaps is the emergence of non-analogous species assemblages when comparing to the natural and seminatural vegetation communities and ecosystems. This study aimed to compare the forest spontaneously developed on the mineral novel material habitat of the post-coal mining heap, with forests in the surrounding, on non-industrial habitats (located in Silesian Upland (South Poland)) in taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity at alpha (within-site) and beta (among sites) levels. The functional traits values of the recorded species composition were calculated to assess, e.g., the taxonomic alpha diversity Shannon's diversity and evenness index, Simpson index, functional richness (FRic), functional dispersion (FDis), functional divergence (FDA), and functional evenness (FEve). Rao's entropy has standardized the Biotic Novelty Index (BNI) to reflect the proportion of functional diversity contributed by novel species composition. The results revealed higher functional richness and dispersion in coniferous forests than in forests on heaps. The plots from coniferous forests and heaps were distinctly differentiated in terms of species composition. No difference occurred in functional evenness and divergence. Vegetation patches of coniferous forests had 19% higher species richness and twice higher Faith's phylogenetic diversity, while no differences in species diversity described by Shannon's diversity index have been recorded. An almost thirty times higher biological novelty index in forests on heaps than in coniferous forests patches has been recorded. The RLQ - analysis of relationships between plant traits, species composition and environmental variables revealed significant associations between EIVs and type of habitat and plant traits. The plant traits such as SLA and SM seem indifferent and do not differentiate the two studied habitats. The results showed that both understanding mechanisms by which these habitats are shaped and recognizing their biological potential and values are essential for nature conservation and management and challenge future studies.

AB  - The motherland of the olive is considered as east of the Mediterranean Basin. Turkey is partly located within this basin having a rich source of biodiversity. Olive growing in Turkey is carried out in the Aegean, Marmara, Mediterranean, Southeastern Anatolia and Black Sea Regions. Climatic factors determine the cultivation limits of olive which is not very selective in terms of soil demand. In regions where olives are grown, the Mediterranean climate prevails. Winters are warm and rainy in the region, while summers are hot and dry. On the other hand, severe cold damage in some years can cause significant damage especially in the inner parts of Aegean, Marmara and Black Sea Regions. As a matter of fact, it is known that 31.8% of olive plantations in Turkey are exposed to occasional frost damage. This situation has revealed the necessity of determining the varieties with high frost tolerance and determining the suitable varieties for the regions where cold damage may occur. In the study, 40 registered olive cultivars in "Kemalpasa Olive Germplasm Bank" in Bornova Olive Research Institute, in Izmir were screened in terms of frost tolerance. To evaluate the frost tolerance (LT50) of cultivars, as estimated by ion leakage (electrical conductivity), leaf samples taken in six different periods over two years were exposed to temperatures at +4 degrees C (control),-2 degrees C,-5 degrees C,-8 degrees C,-11 degrees C,-14 degrees C,-17 degrees C and-20 degrees C. In conclusion; it has been determined that frost tolerance of olive varieties revealed significant variability both genetically and seasonally. Butko, Memeli, Otur, Gemlik, Sinop No 5, Yun celebi, Kara Yaprak, Sati and Sari Ulak were determined as cultivars that were more tolerant of frost. Sinop No 1, Marantelli, Ayvalik, Gorvele, cakir, Samsun Tuzlamalik, Erkence, Saurani, Esek Zeytini (Tekirdag), Kan celebi, Izmir Sofralik, cilli, Samsun Yaglik, Domat, Esek Zeytini (odemis), Sacakli Otur, Sinop No 4, Memecik, Nizip Yaglik, Tekirdag cizmelik and Patos were found to be moderately tolerant cultivars while Edincik, Sinop No 6, cekiste, Mavi, Kiraz, Kilis Yaglik, celebi (Iznik), Trabzon Yaglik, Uslu and Girit olive cultivars were grouped as cultivars having low tolerance to frost. In addition, data showed that cold acclimation in the olive is quite important, and exposure to low temperatures for a certain period of time has significantly increased the frost tolerance. However, this condition was not stable and could rapidly become reversed when temperature reached to the point at which adapdation did not ensure.

AB  - Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) involves utilizing observations of a given species and its surrounding environment to produce a sound approximation of the species' potential distribution. The intricate relationships between organisms and their surroundings, coupled with the profusion of data, have captured the attention of ecologists and statisticians alike. Consequently, they have directed their efforts towards exploring the potential of machine learning techniques. Our study employs an ensemble machine learning approach to simulate the global ecological niche modelling of Ganoderma lucidum fungus. This involves the utilization of various environmental predictors and the averaging of multiple algorithms to achieve a comprehensive analysis. 563 spatially thinned presence points of G. lucidum were projected with three bio-climatic time frames, namely current, 2050, and 2070, and four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), namely 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5, as well as non-climatic variables (surface soil features, land use, rooting depth and water storage capacity at rooting zone). We observed excellent model qualities as the Area Under the receiver operating Curve (AUC) approached 0.90. Random Forest was identified as the best individual algorithm, while the Maxent entropy was identified as the least effective for Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) of G. lucidum. Globally, under the current bio-climatic and non-bioclimatic projection, optimum habitat for this fungus covers 12510876.3 km2 area while, maximum area (13248546.9 Sq. km.) under this habitat class with future projections was recorded with RCP of 8.5 in 2070. The primary determinants of its current global distribution were ecosystem rooting depth, water storage capacity, and precipitation seasonality. While, with two future bioclimatic time frames and RCPs, Isothermality was identified as the most influential predictor. Based on our assessment, it has been determined that this particular fungus is exhibiting a persistent pattern of proliferation across the regions of Europe, America, and certain areas of India. The present investigation sought to underscore the importance of discerning the native habitats of this species, taking into account both current and anticipated climatic shifts. This knowledge is essential for effectively coordinating the artificial cultivation and natural harvesting of G. lucidum, which is necessary to meet the ever-increasing industrial demands.

AB  - Subarctic lakes are getting warmer and more productive due to the joint effects of climate change and intensive land-use practices (e.g. forest clear-cutting and peatland ditching), processes that potentially increase leaching of peat- and soil-stored mercury into lake ecosystems. We sampled biotic communities from primary producers (algae) to top consumers (piscivorous fish), in 19 subarctic lakes situated on a latitudinal (69.0-66.5 degrees N), climatic (+3.2 degrees C temperature and +30% precipitation from north to south) and catchment land-use (pristine to intensive forestry areas) gradient. We first tested how the joint effects of climate and productivity influence mercury biomagnification in food webs focusing on the trophic magnification slope (TMS) and mercury baseline (THg baseline) level, both derived from linear regression between total mercury (log10THg) and organism trophic level (TL). We examined a suite of environmental and biotic variables thought to explain THg baseline and TMS with stepwise generalized multiple regression models. Finally, we assessed how climate and lake productivity affect the THg content of top predators in subarctic lakes. We found biomagnification of mercury in all studied lakes, but with variable TMS and THg baseline values. In stepwise multiple regression models, TMS was best explained by negative relationships with food chain length, climate-productivity gradient, catchment properties, and elemental C:N ratio of the top predator (full model R2 = 0.90, p < 0.001). The model examining variation in THg baseline values included the same variables with positive relationships (R2 = 0.69, p = 0.014). Mass standardized THg content of a common top predator (1 kg northern pike, Esox lucius) increased towards warmer and more productive lakes. Results indicate that increasing eutrophication via forestry-related land-use activities increase the THg levels at the base of the food web and in top predators, suggesting that the sources of nutrients and mercury should be considered in future bioaccumulation and biomagnification studies.

AB  - Fertilization is a common practice to increase forest productivity; however, the responses of soil respiration (R-S) components to the application of inorganic and organic fertilizers and the associated mechanisms are not clear in subtropical forest ecosystems. In this field trial conducted within an intensively-managed Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) forest, we aimed to compare the effects of inorganic and organic fertilizers, and their combination on seasonal variations in R-S components, i.e., heterotrophic (R-H) and autotrophic (R-A) respiration, and to establish the relations of R-S components with soil properties. Fertilizer additions increased R-H (P < 0.05), with the increase being greater with organic than with inorganic fertilizer. Fertilization also increased R-A, but the effect was greater with inorganic fertilizer. Furthermore, fertilizer additions increased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of water-soluble organic C (WSOC) and microbial biomass C, invertase and beta-glucosidase activities, as well as the biomass and N concentration of fine roots. Irrespective of fertilizer treatment, strong seasonal patterns were observed in both R-S and R-H, and an exponential relation (P < 0.01) was found between R-S components (R-H and R-A) and soil temperature. Additionally, the Q10 for RH was higher (P < 0.05) in the inorganic than the organic fertilizer treatment. Although R-S and R-H showed no correlation with soil moisture content in any treatment, each of them was positively correlated with WSOC concentration and activities of invertase and beta-glucosidase (P < 0.05). In the fertilized treatments, RA was positively related to beta-glucosidase activities (P < 0.05) but not to the concentrations of WSOC or microbial biomass C. In conclusion, soil R-A and R-H in the sub-tropical Moso bamboo forest responded differently to the application of inorganic and organic fertilizers, indicating that separation of total RS into soil RH and RA is critically necessary to predict R-S in subtropical forests under different fertilizer regimes.

AB  - Severe drought and insect outbreaks have caused widespread mortality and dieback of trees in semiarid woodlands. Despite the extent and severity of these dieback events, little is known about how the woodland understory vegetation responds to severe drought and whether that response is mediated by changes to the tree layer. We sampled understory vegetation of 98 plots in 25 pinyon-juniper woodland sites in central Nevada with varying amounts of dieback, during the third yr of a severe regional drought. Twenty-five of these plots had predrought baseline data. We related covers of perennial grasses, perennial forbs, shrubs, and the exotic invasive cheatgrass to gradients of aridity, tree cover, soil water capacity, and tree dieback. Between 2005 and 2015, the covers of perennial grasses and forbs declined, while shrub cover remained mostly unchanged. We found that the greatest understory cover was associated with lower tree cover and greater tree dieback. We did not find evidence for rapid colonization of microhabitats created by tree mortality. The site-level response of vegetation to tree dieback depended on aridity: For both perennial grasses and cheatgrass, tree mortality had a positive effect only on dry sites. Cheatgrass abundance increased the most at dry sites with tree dieback, and almost every site with substantial dieback also had cheatgrass present. Our results show differential effects of drought and tree dieback on understory functional types, which may affect the postdrought successional trajectory of drought-impacted pinyon-juniper stands. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms by which tree mortality affects the understory, whether through altering the litter layer, light levels, or soil water, and whether these effects persist over longer timescales.

AB  - This paper provides the first description of the nesting biology of Ancistrocerus flavomarginatus (Br & egrave;thes) (Hymenoptera, Vespidae, Eumeninae), the only species of the genus found in Brazil. Our trap-nest experiments were conducted in two Mixed Ombrophilous Forest fragments and two adjacent matrices in Guarapuava (Paran & aacute; state, Brazil) from August 2017 to July 2018. In each area, we set 192 trap nests divided into six groups of 32 units, totalling 768 trap nests. We obtained a total of 47 nests of A. flavomarginatus, the vast majority of them (43, 91.5%) founded in the forest fragments. Most nests were built in wooden traps with a bore diameter of either 5 or 7 mm (19 nests in each type, 80.8%). Nests comprised 1-12 subcylindrical brood cells arranged linearly and separated from one another by transverse partitions of soil mastic. Larvae consumed 6-10 lepidopteran caterpillars before spinning the cocoon. Ancistrocerus flavomarginatus produced up to 6 annual generations (multivoltinism) and its immature forms were parasitized by chrysidid and ichneumonid wasps. The calculated sex ratio (1.78:1) was statistically biased towards males, but since they (21.3 +/- 2.0 mg) were significantly lighter than females (50.9 +/- 4.0 mg), the resulting investment ratio (1.34:1) was female biased. Males emerged from more external cells and developed significantly faster (27.2 +/- 0.46 days) than females (30.1 +/- 0.66 days), hence a case of protandry. We demonstrated that A. flavomarginatus is largely dependent on the Atlantic Rainforest and thus that deforestation poses a critical threat to this important species.

AB  - Yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) is a minor annual legume crop valued for its productivity in highly infertile, acidic soils and for its very high protein seeds. Yellow lupin belongs to the 'Old World' group of lupin species and is closely related to narrow-leafed lupin. Yellow lupin shares similar climatic adaptation to narrow-leafed lupin over which it offers some additional advantages such as greater water-logging tolerance and disease resistance. Despite its promise, yellow lupin is grown only as a niche crop in Australia, Europe and South America, and has attracted very limited breeding attention to date. Major constraints to the wider uptake of yellow lupin as a crop include lack of diversity in the domesticated gene pool and a historic focus on adaptation to a limited range of environments. Current varieties are also sensitive to some abiotic stresses (notably drought, extreme temperatures, salinity and alkalinity) and to sap-sucking insects such as aphids. Good genetic resources are available for yellow lupin including extensive seed collections that capture much of the species-wide diversity and three recombinant inbred line populations. Until recently, yellow lupin has lagged behind its well-resourced sister species narrow-leafed lupin in terms of genomic resources but is now catching up. Transcriptomic datasets have been used to generate molecular markers and to investigate the causes of flower and pod abortion. The first genetic map for yellow lupin was recently released, which is being used to investigate phenology, domestication traits and productivity under water-limiting conditions. Transgenesis methods have been developed for yellow lupin, a key enabling technology for future genome editing activities. Efforts are underway to develop a high-quality reference genome sequence for yellow lupin. These developing resources will help researchers acquire knowledge and molecular tools to equip lupin breeders to overcome the restraints on broader adoption of this promising legume crop.

AB  - We carried out studies on water deficiency of Sambucus nigra L. (black elderberry) plant leaves extract and fruit juice, relative turgi-dity, sucrose content in fruits, chlorophyll content in the leaves, as well as gas exchange rates in the leaves, inparticular, the changes in the concentrations of oxygen released during photosynthesis by leaves and carbon dioxide released during leaf respiration depending on habitat conditions (altitude of the habitat, position of slopes, average annual precipitation). Taking into account the difference in climatic conditions and the generality of some indicators, Vanadzor (1326-1600 m above sea level) and Stepanavan (1400-1830 m above sea level) regions of Lori Province,"Dilijan" National Park, Lake Parz, and the forest areas adjacent to the city of Dilijan (1240-1612 m above sea level) in Tavush Province in Armenia were chosen as the research sites. The test samples were taken from eight different test sites in Lori and Tavush provinces. Tavush Province is more humid than Lori Provino The highest rate of water deficiency in the leaves ofthe studied plants was recorded in S. nigra f. laciniata (L.) Zabel., and the lowest in S. nigra in Vanadzorforest. It can be assumed that the index ofwater deficiency in the leaves may depend on the position ofthe slopes ofthe test sites and the value ofthe filtration coefficient of the soil types. On the north-facing slope at the height of 1341 mabove sea level and on the south-facing slope at the height of 1830 m above sea level, the values of water deficiency ofthe leaves are almost the same. Such data allows us to assume that the degree of water deficiency in the leaves is also affected by the filtration coefficient of habitat soil types. In two points that have north-facing positions, the water deficiency of leaves at the height of 1341 mabove sea level is 2.14 times more than at the height of 1328 mabove sea level. At 1328 mabove sea level the filtration coefficient is small and the plant absorbs a lot of water. Basedon the data we receivedwe obtained rankings ofplants according to the different criteria ofthe experimental plants: water deficiency in leaves tissues, relative turgidity, the sum of chlorophylls in the leaves, the sucrose content in the fruits, percentage of oxygen released as a result of photosynthesis, percentage of carbon dioxide released as a result of respiration. We found a certain dependence betweentheindicators of the water regime and the height above sea level ofthe researchedhabitats. We also found out that the waterregime is influencedby certain microclimatic conditions such as the position of the slopes, whether they are north or south facing, as well as the average annual precipitation. Knowing the physio-logical processes taking place in the vegetative and generative organs ofthe S. nigra plant is important from the point ofview ofevaluating the intensity ofgrowth and development ofthe generative organs. We considerthat the results ofthe studywillbe applicable in the process ofplant selection based on the indicators ofthe physiological processes takingplace in the plant organism.

AB  - Tropical forests play a crucial role in climate regulation due to their high carbon sequestration capacity. However, degradation and disturbances in these forests may result in significant carbon losses. This study focuses on the impact of various biophysical, anthropogenic, and landscape factors on aboveground biomass (AGB) in heavily disturbed landscapes of Cote d'Ivoire (West Africa), a typical low-forest and high-deforestation country. AGB estimates from a National Forest Inventory dataset have been linked to five categories of variables (Climate, Soil, Topography, Landscape, and Human-related) through a random forest modeling approach that addressed collinearity among variables, selected key variables from each category, and used spatial cross-validation to evaluate model performance. The comprehensive model, combining landscape composition, physical soil properties, and climate variables, demonstrated strong performance with an R-squared of 0.62. Notably, the percentage of landscape occupied by forest within a radius of 1000 m (PLAND1000) had a highly significant impact on AGB, exhibiting a notable increase when PLAND1000 exceeded 80 % and a decrease when it felt below 25 %. Soil properties, both physical (Bulk Density and Coarse Fraction) and chemical (soil pH), significantly influenced AGB, too. Interestingly, climatic, topographic, and other anthropogenic variables had minimal relevance in predicting AGB, suggesting that their effects may have been captured by landscape and soil integrative variables. In order to enhance forest preservation and restoration initiatives in the face of deforestation and fragmentation challenges in the West African region, we recommend (i) evaluating the appropriate landscape scale of effect (a 1000 m radius circle being the most significant in this study); (ii) prioritizing the preservation or restoration of dense forest landscapes; and (iii) integrating landscape composition into forest management policies.

AB  - Aims This study was designed to determine if planting the leguminous tree Inga punctata in previously cleared former tropical premontane wet forests changed the Nitrogen (N)-fixer and Lignin Degrader community compositions resulting in increased accumulation of soil carbon (C) and N components. Methods Soils were collected near the base of old growth (> 50 years old), 4, 8 and 11-year-old I. punctata trees, and assessed for differences in various soil C and N metrics, and the mean proportion of sequences (MPS, as "relative abundance " via 16S rRNA V3, V4 sequencing), composition, stability and evenness of the N-fixer and Lignin Degrader community genera. Results The N-fixer MPS decreased, and Lignin Degraders increased, while evenness and stability of both increased in soils along the tree age gradient. The Lignin Degrader MPS were positively correlated with TN, NO3-, TOC, and Biomass C, and negatively correlated with N-fixer MPS and NH4+. The N-fixer MPS were negatively correlated with TN, NO3-, TOC, Biomass-C and Lignin Degrader MPS, and positively correlated with NH4+. Evenness, stability, and dissimilarity increased for both groups in soils along the tree age gradient. Conclusions This is the first evidence that I. punctata facilitates changes in tree-soil N-fixer and Lignin Degrader communities over time by increasing the dissimilarity, evenness and stability of both groups, and increases the accumulation of tree soil C and N. This suggests I. punctata facilitates soil recovery such that it can serve as C and N sinks and support its future use in reforestation management strategy.

AB  - Forests affect regional climates, livelihoods and global cycles of water, carbon and nitrogen. Anthropogenic activities and climatic change affect forest health and national growth. Therefore, developing effective forest management plans requires understanding of the drivers of forest growth. The primary objective of this study was to understand the long-term effect of abiotic factors on the growth of forests in the region. This study used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for vegetation indices like NDVI and EVI and NASA's Land Assimilation datasets (wind speed, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and temperature) to understand their role on forest growth through statistical techniques such as Pearson's correlation and Multiple Linear Regression. The study examined the relationship between standard monthly vegetation indices and abiotic variables (i.e., moisture and temperature at different soil profiles up to 2 m depth, land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, relative humidity, wind velocity, and air temperature at 2 m height) in selected forests of the Eastern Himalayas for two decades (2001-2020, n = 240). Rainfall, temperature, and other associated factors significantly affected forest growth in the region. It was observed that rainfall alone affected forest growth in the region. However, its impact was maximum after two months of the rain events, reflecting a significant lag effect. Soil moisture at different depths affected vegetation growth in all forest types. Reduced soil moisture had a more significant effect on old-growth forests than younger forests. Multiple Linear Regression models developed with the abiotic factors explained higher variability in forest growth. In conclusion, this study reveals that rainfall, temperature, and their associated variables significantly affected forest growth in the study area. The study has significant implications for forest management in the region for formulating better strategies to mitigate climate change effects on forests in the region in future.

AB  - Changes in vegetation cover due to increasing frequencies of extreme climate events and anthropogenic pressure are already underway; so, predicting the impacts of the near-future climate will be essential for developing mitigation strategies. We modelled the responses of Brazilian biomes to a future scenario (2070) of steady increases in atmospheric CO2 levels, adding soil data to better represent the multidimensional space of the environmental suitability of each biome. We also assessed the effects of changes in environmental suitability on the Brazilian network of protected areas and projected those effects on 1 km resolution maps. The area predicted to be affected by future climate change in Brazil and the consequent loss of suitable habitat surface is 2.59 Mkm(2) - larger than the combined areas of Central America and Mexico - leading the current vegetation to a progressive replacement. We project major changes in the vegetation of the Amazon basin, with the replacement of rainforest by dryer vegetation in the southern and eastern regions of that basin, and the opening of a dry corridor in Para State. We also project an expansion of 41% of the current caatinga cover in the Brazilian semiarid region, with large losses of suitable habitat surface of the current deciduous forest. Approximately, 37% of the coverage of protected areas in Brazil will be affected - with greater damage to indigenous lands. The speed of current environmental change is now unprecedented for the post-glacial era, and will almost certainly lead to increased rates of extinction and the collapse of transition ecosystems. We propose the urgent creation of protected areas in regions designed without significant impacts, but contiguous to those that will be more seriously affected by climate change. Those areas will act as refugia preserving biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the cultural heritages of traditional populations.

AB  - The milpa is a millennial agroecosystem commonly practiced in the Mesoamerica mountains. For soil recovery, the milpa depends on the fallows that develop in lands left unsown after the cultivation stage, but their successional dynamics are little known. We studied the successional dynamics of post-milpa fallows in the mountains of Mixteca Baja, north-western Oaxaca, Mexico, where this cropping system is common. We use the chronosequence approach in fallows ranging from approximate to 20 to 100 years old of three nearby watersheds that differ in their degree of exposure to Pacific Ocean winds, the leading source of rain and moisture. We analyzed information from field plots and unmanned aerial vehicle imagery to detect successional trends in milpa fallows. We find that around two decades after cultivation, the fallows are forests dominated by pines or alders. Plant density, vegetation cover, and diameter at breast height show little change afterward, suggesting that the forests reach a saturating point very early during succession. Subsequently, the main changes are in composition and diversity. Shade-tolerant species may replace pioneer species, species composition is moisture-related, and diversity shows contrasting patterns depending on the watershed. Old-growth vegetation is typically an oak forest in the driest watershed and a tropical montane cloud forest in the most humid. Species dominance tends to decrease with succession. beta-diversity is significant and can be ascribed to microclimate and successional processes associated with orography and the milpa practice. Older stands within the same watershed, tend to diverge in composition relative to younger stands, suggesting a lack of convergence towards a climax community. Combining young and old-growth forests might positively impact biodiversity and landscape resilience and helps explain the millennial persistence of milpas in Mesoamerica.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) community and the Glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) they produce plays important roles in maintaining soil ecosystem functions, promoting ecological restoration, and are important for monitoring changes in soil health from land use change. This research addressed the subtle modifications of AMF and GRSP in different land use types and their association with soil properties. Our objectives were: 1) to assess land use effects on AMF spore density, diversity, and composition besides glomalin fractions (EEG, easily extracted GRSP; TG, total GRSP), and 2) to quantify the relationships between glomalin, AMF community metrics, soil organic carbon (SOC), and key soil quality parameters. Soils were collected in the dry and rainy seasons of 2018 under five land uses, including: three types of agroforestry systems (AS1, A52 and A53), an unmanaged pasture and a secondary forest in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Linear mixed-effects model and multivariate analyses showed that land uses had influenced the AMF community, meanly at the family level. On the other hand, seasonality has not proved to be an essential factor that modulates the changes of the AMF community and glomalin production. The management practices had influenced AMF sporulation and the number of total species in agroforestry systems. Glomalin is a potential contributor for SOC, mainly in agroforestry systems and pasture plots. Moreover, we found a correlation between the AMF community and key soil parameters. For example, most of the AMF families and spore density were positively correlated with the stability of soil aggregates and SOC. Our findings shed light on that land-use change can shift the AMF community, glomalin and their relationship to key soil quality parameters. Moreover, the adoption of agroforestry systems indicates maintenance of biodiversity and other soil quality parameters with future implications for their use to recover degraded areas.

AB  - It is a great concept to let nature do the work of revegetation, however in semi-arid and arid regions the process of natural succession, if it occurs at all, typically requires many years of undisturbed development until an increase in biomass becomes measurable, hence it rather is applied to remote, sparsely populated regions and may be underrated as a measure to restore native vegetation, particularly in inhabited arid areas. What are the factors that make arid successional processes successful, how to expedite, and how to enable their use for the ecological revegetation of densely populated drylands? We review restoration methods that combine the planting of shelterbelt compartments with successional revegetation of the internal area, protected from wind and drought. Various measures of assisted natural succession can be applied to greatly accelerate the revegetation, including soil tillage, amendment with organic matter and the inoculation with cyanobacteria or lichens to form biocrusts. The aim is to initiate the development of native, water-saving savanna with biodiversity, resilience and adaptability to climate change. A narrow twin shelterbelt module could facilitate the use of natural succession within inhabited and peri-urban areas, also serving as protective greenbelt for cities. A pilot is planned in a peri-urban area of Northern Iraq, with a successional area of 125-150 m between shelterbelts. Land-use of agriculture, gardening and recreation can be integrated within the successional area, which also generates engagement of residents in the maintenance work. Planting of shelterbelts is required on 10-25% (not 100%) of the restoration area, therefore the use of assisted succession within protective compartments is expected to have both, ecological and economic advantages over large-scale afforestation.

AB  - Although microbial community and function patterns have been extensively studied, little is known about whether the patterns are consistent in different ecosystems and how they are influenced by seasonality or other environmental factors. To test the driving factors of microbial communities and potential functions, we collected soil samples from five forests (mixed broadleaved-Korean pine forest, mixed pine and oak forest, deciduous broadleaved mixed forest, subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest and tropical rainforest) and three grassland ecosystems (meadow steppe, semi-arid grassland and arid grassland) across China in three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). Microbial diversity based on the sequencing of 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes for fungi were measured, and potential functions represented by soil extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs) were analyzed. The results found that soil EEAs were significantly higher in summer than in spring and autumn, and both bacterial and fungal richness indices showed greater seasonal fluctuations than the diversity. Fungal richness indices were highest in summer in both forest and grassland ecosystems, while the lowest were observed in spring for forest and in autumn for grassland, respectively. In addition, fungal communities were closely related to ecosystem types, while bacterial communities were not significantly different across ecosystems and exhibited a broader habitat niche breadth, but the relative abundance of dominant bacterial phyla showed stronger correlations with environmental variables (including climate, soil properties and nutrients) in grassland than in forest ecosystems. The decoupling of microbial community and EEAs was observed in both forest and grassland ecosystems, indicating the function redundancy of soil microorganisms. The present study provided crucial information about the effects of ecosystem types, seasonality and edaphic factors on soil microbial communities and EEAs, and could advance the understanding of soil potential function responses to environmental changes.

AB  - Forest dynamics are driven by a myriad of factors and link directly to ecosystem services. The dynamics of the highly degraded Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) hotspot is mostly driven by its anthropogenic context. Currently, most of the AF region is composed of small disturbed secondary forest fragments that have received partial or full environmental protection with recent environmental norms. Such protection prevents further disturbances and consequently shifts the course of forest dynamics and ecosystem services in AF. Here, we assess long-term forest dynamics trends of a small secondary AF fragment to test the hypothesis that disturbed AF fragments are reaching advanced successional stages. We used a unique dataset of 126 permanent subplots (totaling 5.04 ha) monitored for 30 years (8 inventories between 1987 and 2017) of a disturbed secondary AF fragment (6.35 ha) that has been fully protected since 1986. In each inventory, we measured all living trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ? 5 cm and counted survivors, recruits and dead individuals between intervals. We monitored the temporal trends of (i) structural variables (biomass, tree density and species richness), (ii) functional composition (wood density and maximum potential size), (iii) and species dominance. Our results indicate that, now under full protection, the fragment is shifting towards a late successional stage: we observed increasing biomass, decreasing tree density (self-thinning) and increasing abundance of late-successional species with conservative strategies. Species richness and dominant species composition were stable throughout the monitoring period, suggesting an absence of substantial changes in community assembly. These results underscore the role played by small secondary AF fragments in ecosystem service provision (e.g., carbon uptake and shelter for biodiversity) and point to their forest dynamics trends.

AB  - The distribution of canopy heights in tropical rain forests directly affects carbon storage and the maintenance of biodiversity. We report results from a unique 20-yr record of annual monitoring of canopy-height distributions across an old-growth tropical rain forest landscape at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Canopy heights to 15 m were measured annually in 18 0.50-ha plots at 231 points on a 5 x 5 m grid from 1999-2018 (nine plots in 1999), and heights >15 m were classified as "high canopy." During the study two major disturbance events (one immediately prior to the study) dominated the landscape-scale distribution of canopy heights. Height recovery from the 1997-1998 strong El Nino disturbance took approximately 15 yr. Frequency of canopy gaps varied an order of magnitude among years and 96% disappeared in <= 2 yr. High-canopy coverage and gap frequency varied substantially across the local gradients of soil nutrients and topography, and plot-level conditions and trends frequently differed from the landscape-level patterns. In contrast to the two major landscape-level disturbances, significant plot-level disturbances were common throughout two decades. Including a similar data set taken in 1992, canopy-height distributions for the last three decades over this old-growth tropical rain forest landscape are most parsimoniously interpreted as showing local disturbance and recovery and no unidirectional trends over time. Together these results suggest that understanding the landscape- and plot-level dynamics of tropical rain forest canopy-height distributions will require repeat sampling for multiple decades, while accurately measuring gap frequency and recovery will require sample intervals of <= 2 yr.

AB  - Establishing modern pollen analogues under various vegetation types in a location is necessary without which it is difficult to accurately interpret fossil pollen assemblages in any region in terms of the past environment and palaeoclimate. We have analysed the modern pollen dataset of 30 surface soil and sediment samples from the forested, cropland, wetland and river sites of the Karimganj District in south Assam, to comprehend the connection between the recent pollen assemblage and the vegetation patterns in the Barak Valley. The overall pollen data reflect the tropical moist deciduous and semi-evergreen forest comprising Syzygium, Schleichera, Terminalia, Lagerstroemia, Duabanga, Sapotaceae, Ilex, Mesua and Schima under a warm and humid climate in response to rainfall variations in the region. The presence of Euphorbiaceae and Convolvulaceae inferred high monsoonal activity in and around the region. A robust relationship between local herbaceous vegetation and pollen was observed. The steady occurrence of cereal pollen (average 18.67%) along with other cultural pollen taxa like Brassicaceae, Coriandrum and Solanaceae illustrate intense agricultural activity around the valley areas. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) and box plot were applied to the quantified data obtained from pollen frequency analyses of the surface samples which clearly revealed a significant variation and similarity in vegetation types. Thus, an attempt has been commenced to precisely observe the behavioural pattern of modern pollen deposition in a varied depositional setting, which could, in turn, help in assessing the expanse of agricultural practices and the depth of deterioration of pristine forests and surrounding areas. This modern training dataset could also help in the precise reconstruction of past climate and vegetation shifts in the Barak Valley region. A correlation of regional palynodata with other regions of the Indian subcontinent and Indo-Burma will also be assessed for better interpretation.

AB  - The Amazon rainforest and the biodiversity hotspot of the Atlantic Forest are home to fruit trees that produce functional foods, which are still underutilized. The present study aimed to select potential functional nut donor trees from two Brazilian chestnuts, by evaluating the nutritional and antioxidant composition of the nuts and the fatty acid profile of the oil. The nutritional characteristics, antioxidants, oil fatty acid profile, and X-ray densitometry of the nuts were evaluated, as well as the characterization of leaf and soil nutrients for each parent tree. The nut oil was evaluated through Brix (%), mass (g), yield (%), and the fatty acid profile. For L. pisonis, the most nutritious nuts were produced by L. pisonis tree 4 (N > P > K > Mg > Ca > Zn > Fe) and L. pisonis tree 6 (P > Ca > Mg > Mn > Zn > Cu > Fe), and for the species L. lanceolata, L. lanceolata tree 6 (N > P > Ca > Mg > Zn > Fe > Cu) and L. lanceolata tree 2 (P > K > Mg > Zn > Cu). In L. pisonis, the highest production of anthocyanins, DPPH, total phenolics, and flavonoids was obtained from the nuts of L. pisonis tree 4 as well as for L. lanceolata, from L. lanceolata tree 1, except for flavonoids. The Brix of the oil from the nuts of both species showed no difference between the trees and the fatty acid profile with a similar amount between saturated (48-65%) and unsaturated (34-57%) fatty acids. Both species have nuts rich in nutrients and antioxidant compounds and can be considered unconventional functional foods. The data collected in the present study confirm that the nuts of these species can replace other foods as a source of selenium.

AB  - Determination of reclamation status of secondary forests is particularly urgent in human impacted landscapes for conservation of biodiversity and other ecosystem services. However, there is a lack of a quantitative method to estimate the recovery status of secondary forest globally. In the present work, the authors have attempted to estimate the recovery status of a dry secondary forest of Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR), India quantitatively with a nearby primary forest. We have formulated an equation (measure of climax stage) to estimate the secondary forest for its possible climax stage (early climax stage/mid climax stage/stable climax stage/non climax stage) based on species richness. For this study, the value of "measure of climax stage " between 0 and 0.2 is considered as stable climax stage, 0.2-0.6 as mid climax stage and 0.6-1 as early climax stage. On the other hand, the value > 1 was considered as a non-climax stage of the forest. Accordingly, the studied secondary forest was estimated as to be in mid climax stage (measure of climax stage = 0.4230) even after c. 25 years of successional stage. We have also estimated the recovery stage of a secondary dry forest in SBR by fitting it with a suitable equation and found that the time frame for the stable climax stage is more than 50 years. ANOVA analysis indicates that there is no significant difference observed in the case of soil nutrient contents (except Electrical Conductivity) between primary and secondary forest sites. This developed equation may be implicated in the evaluation of reclamation status of secondary and degraded forest lands globally. Further, in-depth study is encouraged for the development of a modern climax concept to understand the ecological restoration process in a better way.

AB  - The Rosaceae family plays a leading role in the dendroflora of Armenia. The Pyrus, Sorbus, Crataegus, Cotoneaster, Rubus and Rosa genera representing the family are of great importance in Armenia in the formation of various plant coexistences. With its species composition and taxonomic diversity, Crataegus is one of the largest genera in the Rosaceae family. Growing in Armenia in low, medium and high mountain zones, Crataegus has a great role in the formation of dendroflora: they are an important element of a number of forest coexistences, form a sub-forest with other representatives of dendroflora, grow in arid sparse forests, scrub, shoreline areas of mountain rivers. Crataegus is a valuable plant resource. Some species produce tasty and nutritious fruits that are rich in sugars, organic acids, mineral salts and vitamins. Since ancient times, the people of Armenia have used it in food and folk medicine, for example there is a decoction of hawthorn root and bark dyed threads. Currently, Crataegus has great economic importance. Drought-resistant and frost-resistant species are used as grafts for obtaining high-value varieties of apple, pear, and quince, decorative species are suitable for greening cities and settlements, creating living fences. Furniture and carpentry tools are made from its hard and strong natural wood. Due to their hardiness, some species of Crataegus are promising for the creation of arid arboretums in the lower and middle mountain zones of Armenia. In Armenia the genus Crataegus is represented by 23 species belonging to three sections: Crataegus, Pentagynae C. K. Schneid. and Azaroli Loud. Species C. ulotricha Pojark. ex Gladkova, C. razdanica Pojark. ex Sargsyan, C. gabrielianae Pojark. ex Sargsyan, C. susanykleinae Gabrieljan et Sargsyan and C. gregorianii Gabrielian et Sargsyan are endemic to Armenia. An updated key is provided to identify species based on new data. Altitudinal and geographical distribution of species, habitat, flowering and fruiting time are given.

AB  - The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Forest Reserve is a secondary rainforest that has been protected since 1965. It serves as a refuge for many species that were once common but have declined, due to urbanisation and population pressure. The study was conducted to assess the natural regeneration status and soil seed bank composition of the Forest Reserve. Two transects of 500 m were laid out using systematic line transect sampling technique. Ten sample plots of 25 m x 25 m (625 m2) on each line transect were used to identify tree species. Subplots of 5 m x 5 m for shrub and climber species, as well as 1 m x 1 m for herb species were demarcated at the corners and centre of the main plots for identification. Quadrats (15 x 15 cm) were laid out at the corners of the plots and at the centre for soil collection at depths of 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-15 cm. The regeneration status of species was determined based on sample size of seedlings, saplings and mature trees. Floristic compositions in the Forest Reserve included 58 tree, 26 shrub, 19 climber and 6 herb species. The natural regeneration status of the Forest Reserve was good with high numbers of seedlings (465/ha; 37.05%) and saplings (431/ha; 34.34%) compared with mature trees (359/ha; 28.61%). The families observed to be most abundant in the regeneration were Malvaceae, Moraceae and Apocynaceae. A total of 21 species was recorded using the seedling emergence technique. There were 11 herbs, six climbers, one shrub and three tree species. Similarity between standing vegetation and seed bank was low (0.067). The study revealed a poor soil seed bank composition, suggesting that regeneration of woody species from the persistent seed bank would be hampered if the standing vegetation is degraded.

AB  - Desert riparian vegetation forms an ecological corridor in extremely arid environments, and ecological water conveyance is an important measure of vegetation restoration and biodiversity conservation in desert riparian zones. Studying the responses of vegetation to ecological water conveyance and changes in this process in arid desert riparian zones and assessing the comprehensive benefits of ecological water conveyance are highly significant for ecological conservation and restoration in addition to the formulation of water transfer policies. Previous studies mainly used a single indicator to evaluate the ecological restoration of the mainstream Tarim River in Northwest China; thus, systematic and comprehensive assessments based on multiple indicators have not been conducted. In the present study, remote sensing data and field surveys were used to analyze the ecological restoration status of the Tarim River during 2015-2021 in terms of hydrological responses, vegetation responses, and ecological water conveyance benefits. The results showed that groundwater levels and soil moisture in the mainstream area of the Tarim River increased significantly from 2015 to 2021. The amount of groundwater storage also increased. Ecological water conveyance has created good hydrological conditions for groundwater recharge and ecological restoration on both sides of the mainstream area of the Tarim River. Desert forest ecosystems, mainly comprising Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima, have been saved and rejuvenated in water conveyance areas. After ecological water conveyance, the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indices increased significantly, but the diversity level began to decline and then stabilize with the increase in water conveyance frequency. The overall habitat status improved and the quality of the ecological environment below the Wusiman section of the middle reaches of the Tarim River improved significantly.

AB  - This study was conducted in the Kilombero Valley Ramsar Site (KVRS), the largest low-altitude freshwater wetland in East Africa to: 1) determine pesticide contamination of soil, water, and sediment at different seasonal weather conditions 2) critically analyze the seasonal and spatial ecological impacts of pesticide contaminations under tropical weather conditions 3) estimate the potential environmental risks from pesticide exposure based on analytical data. Surface sediments, soil and water samples were collected from sugarcane, teak and rice plantations of the KVRS during the dry (January 2012) and the rainy (March-April 2013) seasons. Samples were screened for 97 different types of pesticide residues using and LC-MS and HPLC-MS. Physical-chemical properties of the sediment and soil samples and meteorological data were analyzed. 92% of soil and sediment samples had relatively low OM content (<5%) while 60% of samples had high clay content, indicating high cation exchange capacity that can bind pesticides to the soils. Field soil and air temperature ranging 28-35 degrees C, total sunshine hours-208 h/month, photo radiation -764 MJ/m(2), average precipitation 300 mm/month, wind speed >60 km/h, humidity >80% were recorded. Frequency of detection and concentration of pesticides residues depended on seasons. For the dry season sampling, glyphosate/AMPA (0.01-0.55 mu g/g), and diuron (0.026-1.7 mu g/g) were mostly detected in the sediment and soils. Monuron (1.28-3.9 mu g/L) and propoxur (0.05-0.6 mu g/L) were mostly detected in the rainy seasons (water and sediments). Glyphosate was above limit of detection in the dry season water samples indicating that its emission into the water system may have been directly through application. Maximum diuron concentrations in water were >30 times higher than the estimated predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) value (0.054 mu g/L) indicating a risk to aquatic community. Calculated pore water concentrations (0.992-0.081 mu g/L), exceeded the estimated PNEC values during the dry season, indicating a risk to benthic organisms. Detection of pesticide is influenced by application, environmental factors and the timing of sampling. Further research is recommended to increase our knowledge on soil-water-sediment interactions in the tropics with regard to pesticides.

AB  - Rock outcrops are islands in the landscape that usually harbor a xeric saxicolous flora with endemic and en-dangered species. They are abundant in the Neotropical region, but floristic and ecological studies are centered on quartzite and granite-gneissic lithologies, leaving a knowledge gap regarding those of calcareous origin. It is expected that outcrops of carbonate rocks, like other rock outcrops, harbor a peculiar saxicolous flora tolerant to drought, and share communities of species associated with the distinct microhabitats. To test these assumptions, we carried out a floristic survey of the saxicolous vascular vegetation of two calcareous outcrops at Lagoa Santa region, Minas Gerais, Brazil, the historical site studied in the XIX Century by Eugen Warming - one of the fathers of Ecology. We also analysed the floristic similarity between the outcrops, among the five recognized micro -habitats, crevices, exposed rock, fissures, soil islands, and epiphytic, as well as the life form spectra. Our results registered 45 families, 92 genera and 124 species, standing out Orchidaceae (14 species), Bromeliaceae (11 species), Piperaceae (10 species) and Asteraceae (8 species). There was a low similarity between the outcrops (Ij = 0.45), but the cluster analysis revealed three floristic groups inhabiting the microhabitats (exposed rock, crevices-soil islands, and fissure-epiphytic), each one sharing a similar subset of species. The distribution of the life forms into the microhabitats was homogeneous in the two outcrops, meaning that there is a correspondence between them. Three saxicolous species are threatened, but most of the inventoried species (73%) were never assessed and may be under extinction risk. Our results highlight that the saxicolous flora on outcrops of car-bonate rocks deserve more attention on conservation once they have high biological importance, share com-munities of saxicolous plants inhabiting particular microhabitats, and face strong pressures of anthropic activities, especially mining.

AB  - A decrease in the ground surface height of coastal wetlands is of worldwide concern because of its relationship to peat loss, coastal carbon, and biodiversity in freshwater wetlands. We asked if it is possible to determine in-dicators of impending transitions of freshwater swamps to other coastal types by examining long-term changes in the environment and vegetation. In a tidal Taxodium distichum swamp in Hickory Point State Forest, Maryland, the topographic surface height (ground surface height) decreased by as much as 25.6 +/- 2.2 to 50.8 +/- 3.8 cm at two Surface Elevation Tables from 2015 to 2021 following salinity intrusion events related to hurricanes and offshore storms (e.g., Hurricane Melissa). In 2019, rooting zone salinity exceeded 5 ppt for >24.9 % of the time, with a maximum salinity level of 12.5 ppt. Tree growth of T. distichum trees declined and 60 % of these trees died along a 4 m wide x 125 m transect in 2014-2016. Root biomass and ground surface height decreased roughly in conjunction with a salinity pulse in the rooting zone during Hurricane Melissa in 2019. Saplings survived but T. distichum seedlings were uncommon and did not survive in the study area. Typha x glauca increased in cover (0.2 to 5.6 % cover plot-1) from 2014 to 2016 so a vegetation shift toward T. x glauca was apparent by 2021. This work captures a multi-year trend of decreasing ground surface height, tree growth and health, and fresh-water status in the rooting zone that may be an indicator of impending vegetation transition.

This study integrated hydrochemistry, multi-isotope tracers (delta N-15-NO3-, delta O-18-NO3-, delta B-11) and a Bayesian mixing model (mixSIAR) to improve on the apportionment of multiple NO3- sources in the Nyando River basin of Lake Victoria, Kenya. River water was monitored spatially in the basin for hydro-chemical and isotopic parameters from July 2016 to May 2018. The data shows that NO3- concentrations in the basin are governed by the predominant land use. Mixed agriculture (MA) land use recorded significantly higher NO3- concentrations (8.8 +/- 10.6 mg L-1), compared to other land use zones: residential & industrial (RI) 3.4 +/- 2.2 mg L-1, sugarcane (S) 3.2 +/- 1.5 mg L-1 and tea & forest areas (TF) 3.0 +/- 1.1 mg L-1. Stable isotope data and hydrochemistry complemented each other in identifying the potential NO3- sources and their spatial-temporal variation in the basin. Boron isotope (delta B-11) data was categorically helpful in overcoming the limitations of delta N-15-, delta O-18-NO3- to discriminate between manure and sewage sources. delta B-11 specifically identified manure as the dominant source of river NO3- input in the MA, RI and S land use zones and also indicated soil N as the main river NO3- source in the TF land use. These findings were substantiated via nitrate source apportionment using a Bayesian isotopic mixing model which showed manure and/or sewage were the leading sources of river NO3- input in the basin, contributing 70% (MA), 65% (RI), 60% (S) and 46% (TF). Soil N ranked second with its highest proportional river NO3- contribution of 41%, recorded for the TF land use, followed by 29% (S), 24% (RI) and 18% (MA). Ammonium in fertilizers and/or rain was third contributing about 10% NO3- for all land uses, while NO3- fertilizers showed 1-2% contribution across the basin. Nitrate in precipitation was the least NO3- source, contributing <1% across the basin. In order to control excess NO3- discharge in the basin, better guidelines for animal manure use, land conservation measures and improvement of sanitation systems should be prioritized.

AB  - Simple Summary The Montado is a characteristic ecosystem of the Mediterranean region, where agricultural activities, animal production and forestry coexist alongside tourism, hunting and leisure activities. Animal grazing is fundamental for the conservation of the Montado, and it is imperative to clearly understand its interactions with the pasture floristic composition (PFC) of the Montado. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sheep grazing, stocking rates and dolomitic limestone application on the floristic composition of permanent dryland pastures, in the Montado agroforestry system of Southern Portugal. The type of grazing influences the PFC, which may be positively or negatively impacted, depending on the adopted system. Deferred grazing seems to benefit the disappearance of undesirable plants and the appearance of desired plants. The results of this study allow for more informed management decisions and a potential increase in animal production but also improve the knowledge of conservation strategies in the Montado. The Montado is a complex agroforestry-pastoral ecosystem due to the interactions between soil-pasture-trees-animals and climate. The typical Montado soil has an acidic pH and manganese toxicity, which affect the pasture's productivity and pasture floristic composition (PFC). The PFC, on the other hand, can also be influenced by the type and intensity of grazing, which can lead to significant decreases in the amount of biomass produced and the biodiversity of species in the pasture. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of grazing type, by sheep, and different stocking rates on the PFC throughout the vegetative pasture cycle in areas with and without dolomitic limestone application. Thus, four treatments (P1UC to P4TC) were constituted: P1UC-without limestone application (U) and continuous grazing (CG); P2UD-U and deferred grazing (DG); P3TD-with the application of limestone (T) and DG; P4TC-T and CG. In DG plots, the placement and removal of the animals were carried out as a function of the average height of the pasture (placement-10 cm; removal-3 to 5 cm). The PFC was characterized in winter, at the peak of spring and in late spring. The PFC data were subjected to a multilevel pattern analysis (ISA). The combination of rainfall and temperature influenced the pasture growth rates and consequently the height of the pasture at different times of the year. Therefore, with the different growth rates of the pasture throughout the year, the sheep remain for different periods of time in the deferred grazing treatments. In the four treatments, 103 plant species were identified. The most representative botanical families in the four treatments were Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. ISA identified 14 bioindicator species: eight for the winter period, three for the late spring vegetative period and three for the TC treatment.

AB  - Understanding patterns in forest communities and its driving factors play a critical role in ecological studies. In view of this, present study attempts to understand the role of environmental and anthropogenic factors towards shaping species diversity and composition along the altitudinal gradient (700-3800 m asl) in Indian western Himalaya. A total of 51 tree species (28 families) were recorded; Pinaceae (5) and Fagaceae (5) were the species rich families. alpha-diversity indices i.e., Margalef's richness index (R), Shannon index (HMODIFIER LETTER PRIME) and Simpson index showed a humped shaped distribution, whereas Evenness index (E) showed an inverted humped shaped distribution along the altitude range. Based on non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS), four different community types were identified. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed a strong relationship of tree species composition with environmental (41.73% variation) and anthropogenic factors (17.35% variation). RDA further indicated that the bulk density (BD), disturbance index (DI), mean diurnal temperature range (Bio2) and solar radiation (SR) are significantly associated with sub-tropical (below 1200 m) and lower temperate forest (1200-1700 m) types. Likewise, soil organic carbon (SOC), precipitation of the driest quarter (Bio17) and pH were significantly associated with upper temperate (1700-2900 m), and subalpine forest composition (>2900 m). Both NMDS classification and RDA ordination clearly demonstrate spatial variability in composition of tree community and environmental properties.

AB  - Sound management of native forests used for cattle grazing requires understanding the dynamics of forage productivity in the openings. Despite their importance, forage productivity drivers in highly heterogeneous forested landscapes, or their variability over the year, are still unclear. The aim of this work is to find predictors of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variation in the openings of native temperate forests and to evaluate how these predictors change within the growing season. We used high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery from NW Patagonia to separate forest openings from tree dense canopy. We obtained data of each opening related with herbaceous and shrub forage productivity and calculated landscape metrics. We estimated a multiple linear regression model for predicting NDVI in each season. Beyond known variables related with forage productivity (altitude, precipitation, etc.), the shape of forest' openings appeared as relevant in predicting NDVI. Higher values of forest opening perimeters were related with a decrease in NDVI in spring when soil water content is not limiting and conversely with an increase in NDVI in summer when water is limiting growth. These results suggest that environmental drivers such as temperature and soil moisture inside the opening, and competition or facilitation process between trees and grasses are mediated by the shape of the opening. Management of heterogeneous native forests for cattle raising requires considering the shape of the openings to maximize forage productivity.

AB  - The genus Quercus (oak), family Fagaceae, comprises around 500 species, being one of the most important and dominant woody angiosperms in the Northern Hemisphere. Nowadays, it is threatened by environmental cues, which are either of biotic or abiotic origin. This causes tree decline, dieback, and deforestation, which can worsen in a climate change scenario. In the 21st century, biotechnology should take a pivotal role in facing this problem and proposing sustainable management and conservation strategies for forests. As a non-domesticated, long-lived species, the only plausible approach for tree breeding is exploiting the natural diversity present in this species and the selection of elite, more resilient genotypes, based on molecular markers. In this direction, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms of the tolerance or resistance to stresses, and the identification of genes, gene products, and metabolites related to this phenotype. This research is being performed by using classical biochemistry or the most recent omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) approaches, which should be integrated with other physiological and morphological techniques in the Systems Biology direction. This review is focused on the current state-of-the-art of such approaches for describing and integrating the latest knowledge on biotic and abiotic stress responses in Quercus spp., with special reference to Quercus ilex, the system on which the authors have been working for the last 15 years. While biotic stress factors mainly include fungi and insects such as Phytophthora cinnamomi, Cerambyx welensii, and Operophtera brumata, abiotic stress factors include salinity, drought, waterlogging, soil pollutants, cold, heat, carbon dioxide, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation. The review is structured following the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and the omic cascade, from DNA (genomics, epigenomics, and DNA-based markers) to metabolites (metabolomics), through mRNA (transcriptomics) and proteins (proteomics). An integrated view of the different approaches, challenges, and future directions is critically discussed.

AB  - Nematodes occupy vital positions in soil food webs and are sensitive to environmental disturbances. Although soil nematode ecological indices are useful indicators of soil environmental conditions and processes, the overall effects of nitrogen addition and warming on nematode ecological indices are unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis to understand how nematode ecological indices are affected by experimental treatments: nitrogen addition and warming. The results showed that nitrogen addition significantly reduced the maturity index (MI) by 7% and the structure index (SI) by 11% but significantly increased the plant-parasitic index (PPI) by 1%. Warming reduced the channel index (CI) by 35% but did not significantly affect the other ecological indices. The effects of nitrogen addition and warming on ecological indices depended on the experimental system (ecosystem, duration, and methods) and environmental factors (mean annual temperature, precipitation, and latitude). The ecological indices were affected more by long-term than by short-term experiments. The MI consistently decreased when NH4+ or urea was added. The addition of NH4NO3 significantly increased the PPI by 1%. The response of ecological indices to nitrogen addition and warming varied among ecosystems. For example, the decrease in SI was significant only in cropland under N addition. The PPI was significantly decreased in forests under warming conditions. In addition, a high level of warming (>= 2 ?) increased the MI by 10%. This synthesis increases our understanding of the effects of climate change on the soil environment and ecosystem functions.

AB  - Background and Aims In fragmented forests, proximity to forest edges can favour the establishment of resource-acquisitive species over more resource-conservative species. During seedling recruitment, resource-acquisitive species may benefit from either higher light availability or weaker top-down effects of natural enemies. The relative importance of light and enemies for recruitment has seldom been examined with respect to edge effects.
   Methods In a human-modified wet tropical forest in India, we first examined how functional traits indicative of resource-acquisitive vs. resource-conservative strategies, i.e. specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content, wood density and seed size, explained interspecific differences in densities of seedling recruits with distance to the forest edge. Then, we checked whether fungicide and insecticide treatments and canopy openness (proxy for light availability) explained edge effects on trait-mediated changes in seedling density. Finally, we examined whether light availability and natural enemy activity explained edge effects on functional diversity of seedling recruits.
   Key Results Up to 60 m from edges, recruit densities increased with decreasing seed size, but not at 90-100 m, where recruit densities increased with higher SLA. Trait-mediated variation in recruit densities changed with pesticides only at 90-100 m: compared with control plots, fungicide increased recruit densities for low SLA species and insecticide increased smaller seeded species. For SLA, wood density and seed size, functional diversity of recruits was higher at 90-100 m than at 0-5 m. At 90-100 m, fungicide decreased functional diversity for SLA and insecticide reduced seed size diversity compared with control plots. Canopy openness explained neither variation in recruit density in relation to traits nor functional diversity.
   Conclusions Altered biotic interactions can mediate local changes to trait composition and functional diversity during seedling recruitment in forest fragments, hinting at downstream effects on the structure and function of human-modified forests.

AB  - Simple Summary Oaks (Quercus spp.) are a major component of subtropical and temperate forests in the Northern Hemisphere. There are approximately 464 species, and they are dominant tree species in ecosystems. Oaks have a long history of cultivation in Europe, North America, and other continents. They are also cultivated and distributed in most provinces of China. In this paper, Quercus germplasm resource distribution, ecological adaptability, and utilization are explored. All evidence indicates that oaks have been widely distributed since ancient times and have greater functional value than other species in the Fagaceae family. This review will provide a deeper understanding of oak conservation, development, and utilization in China. Oaks exhibit unique biological characteristics and high adaptability to complex climatic and soil conditions. They are widely distributed across various regions, spanning 40 degrees latitude and 75 degrees longitude. The total area of oak forest in China is 16.72 million hm(2). There are 60 lineages of Quercus in China, including 49 species, seven varieties, and four subgenera. Archaeological data indicate that oaks were already widely distributed in ancient times, and they are dominant trees in vast regions of China's forests. In addition, the acorn was an important food for ancestral humans, and it has accompanied human civilization since the early Paleolithic. Diverse oak species are widely distributed and have great functional value, such as for greening, carbon sequestration, industrial and medicinal uses, and insect rearing. Long-term deforestation, fire, diseases, and pests have led to a continuous decline in oak resources. This study discusses the Quercus species and their distribution in China, ecological adaptation, and the threats facing the propagation and growth of oaks in a changing world. This will give us a better understanding of Quercus resources, and provide guidance on how to protect and better utilize germplasm resources in China. The breeding of new varieties, pest control, and chemical and molecular research also need to be strengthened in future studies.

AB  - The fluctuation of streamflow in snowmelt-dominated watersheds may be an indicator of climate change. However, the relationship between the start of growing season (SOS) and the streamflow in snowmelt-dominated watersheds is not clear. In this study, we update the Coupled Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (CHESS) model by incorporating the Growing Season Index (GSI) module to estimate the start of the growing season. The updated CHESS model is then used to calculate the streamflow in the Cleve Creek, Incline Creek and Twin River watersheds located in Nevada in the United States from 1981 to 2017. This updated CHESS can be applied in any regions that are suitable for deciduous vegetation. The streamflow in the static and dynamic scheme in the three watersheds have been simulated between 1981 and 2017 with the NS of 0.52 and 0.80 in the Cleve Creek, 0.46 and 0.75 in the Incline Creek, and 0.42 and 0.70 in the Twin River watersheds, respectively. The results illustrate that the SOS have come around 3-5 weeks earlier during the last 37 years. The results illustrate a high correlation between the temperature and the timing of the SOS. Early SOS leads to a substantial increase in total annual transpiration. An increase in annual transpiration can reduce aquifer recharge and increase cumulative growing season soil moisture deficit. Comparing to the streamflow without vegetation, the streamflow with vegetation is smaller due to transpiration. As the SOS comes earlier, the peaks of the streamflow with vegetation also come earlier. If the shifts in SOS continue, the effects on annual rates of transpiration can be significant, which may reduce the risk of flooding during snowmelt. On the other hand, earlier SOS may cause soil moisture to decline during summer, which would increase the drought stress in trees and the risk of wildfires and insect infestation.

AB  - In south-central Chile, the dynamics of southern beech (Nothofagaceae) stands vary predictably along climatic gradients. Beeches form persistent stands at high elevations, but their establishment on lowland sites depends mainly on catastrophic disturbances. In New Zealand, nearly all studies of beech forest dynamics to date have reported all-sized, persistent populations. However, previous work has focused largely on the South Island or on North Island mountains, where beeches are widespread and often dominant. Little is known about beech dynamics in the warm North Island lowlands, where beeches are less common. We aimed to clarify the circumstances that enable beeches to establish on lowland sites in the North Island. We measured population structures of beeches and associated species on 11 plots distributed across a range of climate, lithology and topography. On sites where the most shade-tolerant broadleaved trees were absent or uncommon, all-sized populations showed that beech regeneration did not depend on major disturbances. These stands were located mostly on steep faces or ridges with soil carbon:nitrogen ratios > 18, usually with ericaceous understoreys. On sites with higher N availability, where shade-tolerant broadleaved trees were abundant, beech populations were generally sparser, with restricted age ranges. One of these +/- even-aged beech stands appeared to have established after windthrow, the other four after fires. Recent dieback of Weinmannia racemosa associated with insect attack had resulted in another wave of beech regeneration in one of the post-fire stands. Establishment on landslides appears to only rarely enable beeches to capture new sites in the lowland North Island. We conclude that beeches form stable self-replacing stands on lowland North Island sites with low nitrogen availability, but that exogenous disturbances occasionally enable beeches to establish as pioneers on sites with higher nitrogen availability. The early successionalrole commonly seen in lowland south-central Chile thus appears less widespread in New Zealand.

AB  - Simple Summary Global climate change has a significant impact on soil decomposition processes through the alteration of temperature and precipitation and, in connection with them, through changes in the quantity and quality of biomass production in ecosystems. The role of soil organic matter (SOM) is particularly important, as the consequences might rapidly affect soil carbon stocks. These processes have a global impact on the CO2 content of the atmosphere and a local impact on the fertility of soils. In our research, which is based on a transcontinental litter manipulation, detritus input, and removal treatment (DIRT) project, we investigated how quantitative and qualitative changes in litter inputs can affect decomposition processes and carbon storage capacity of soils in relation to SOM content. The main question of the study is how various litter treatment sites respond to additional and/or removed organic matters through assessed soil-biological parameters. The changes were monitored with some potential soil-biological indicators, such as through examining enzyme activity, CO2 emissions, and labile carbon stocks (POXC) used by organisms in performing decomposition processes. The model experiment provided a great background highlighting organic matter's importance in soil-biological processes and soil ecosystem functioning. Soil organic matter is a biological system that functions as an integrated whole. These assemblies have different properties, functions, and decomposition times. SOM is one of the main determinants of soil productivity. Our studies were carried out in a temperate deciduous oak forest on Luvisols soil. In the DIRT Project (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments), the following treatments were applied: Double Litter, Double Wood, Control, No Litter, No Root and No Input. Our objective was to compare the effect of withdrawal or doubling of organic matter on the protein pattern of the soil and the biological activity and changes in labile C (permanganate-oxidizable carbon) content in a long-term organic matter manipulation experiment. Patterns of thermostable proteins, soil dehydrogenase enzyme activity, CO2 emission, and POXC content were measured at the most biologically active soil depth of 0-5 cm after 23 years of treatment. Our results show that the enzyme activities of the litter removal treatments were significantly reduced compared to the doubling treatments, as were the values of soil respiration. The same significant difference was also detected in the C content of the soils of the treatments. Based on cluster analysis of the protein profile of the soil samples, the No Litter and No Input treatments were significantly different from the other treatments. This shows that specific organic matter is needed to enhance soil biological activity and the associated POXC content.

AB  - Aim: Efforts to predict the responses of soil fungal communities to climate change are hindered by limited information on how fungal niches are distributed across environmental hyperspace. We predict the climate sensitivity of North American soil fungal assemblage composition by modelling the ecological niches of several thousand fungal species.Location: One hundred and thirteen sites in the United States and Canada spanning all biomes except tropical rain forest.Major Taxa Studied: Fungi.Time Period: 2011-2018.Methods: We combine internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences from two continental-scale sampling networks in North America and cluster them into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity. Using climate and soil data, we fit ecological niche models (ENMs) based on logistic ridge regression for all OTUs present in at least 10 sites (n = 8597). To describe the compositional turnover of soil fungal assemblages over climatic gradients, we introduce a novel niche-based metric of climate sensitivity, the Sorensen climate sensitivity index. Finally, we map climate sensitivity across North America.Results: ENMs have a mean out-of-sample predictive accuracy of 73.8%, with temperature variables being strong predictors of fungal distributions. Soil fungal climate niches clump together across environmental space, which suggests common physiological limits and predicts abrupt changes in composition with respect to changes in climate. Soil fungi in North American climates are more likely to be limited by cold and dry conditions than by warm and wet conditions, and ectomycorrhizal fungi generally tolerate colder temperatures than saprotrophic fungi. Sorensen climate sensitivity exhibits a multimodal distribution across environmental space, with a peak in climates corresponding to boreal forests.Main Conclusions: The boreal forest occupies an especially precarious region of environmental space for the composition of soil fungal assemblages in North America, as even small degrees of warming could trigger large compositional changes characterized mainly by an influx of warm-adapted species.

AB  - Plant invasion has been considered as one of the most influential forces that change the soil physico-chemical and biological properties of forest ecosystems. We have investigated the impact of two invasive alien plants, Lantana camara and Ageratina adenophora on soil physico-chemical and microbial properties in three different pine forests (Chanfi, Matial and Mehra) in the central Himalaya. Three subsites viz., non-invaded (NI), L. camara invaded (LI) and A. adenophora invaded (AI), were identified in each forest. Soil samples were collected seasonally in triplicate from the surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-20 and 20-30 cm) depths and processed in the laboratory. PCA and correlation analysis were conducted to explore the relationship between soil properties, status (invaded and non-invaded) and soil depths. The soil variables were further compared between status and depth using linear mixed-effect model (LMM) and Tukey's HSD test. It was found that in LI and AI sites, soil properties such as moisture (Mo), porosity (Po), organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), potassium (K), microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) were significantly (p < 0.05) higher and bulk density (BD) was lower in the surface soil (0-10 cm) than NI site but the difference was less prominent in subsurface (10-20 and 20-30 cm) depths. The MBC and MBN showed similar seasonal variations among LI, AI and NI sites following the trend of rainy > summer > winter. The results indicated that L. camara and A. adenophora invasion alter the soil properties and develop nutrient-rich substratum which may further promote the invasiveness in chir pine forest. The present findings would be helpful to develop appropriate management strategies for minimizing the impact of these invasive species on the soil characteristics including nutrient cycling processes of chir pine forests in the central Himalaya.

AB  - The mycobiome, comprising fungi inhabiting plants, potentially plays a crucial role in tree health and survival amidst environmental stressors like climate change and pathogenic fungi. Understanding the intricate relationships between trees and their microbial communities is essential for developing effective strategies to bolster the resilience and well-being of forest ecosystems as we adopt more sustainable forest management practices. The mycobiome can be considered an integral aspect of a tree's biology, closely linked to its genotype. To explore the influence of host genetics and environmental factors on fungal composition, we examined the mycobiome associated with phloem and roots of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) cuttings under varying watering conditions. To test the "mycobiome-associated-fitness" hypothesis, we compared seedlings artificially inoculated with Heterobasidion parviporum and control plants to evaluate mycobiome interaction on necrosis development. We aimed to 1) identify specific mycobiome species for the Norway spruce genotypes/families within the phloem and root tissues and their interactions with H. parviporum and 2) assess stability in the mycobiome species composition under abiotic disturbances (reduced water availability). The mycobiome was analyzed by sequencing the ribosomal ITS2 region. Our results revealed significant variations in the diversity and prevalence of the phloem mycobiome among different Norway spruce genotypes, highlighting the considerable impact of genetic variation on the composition and diversity of the phloem mycobiome. Additionally, specific mycobiome genera in the phloem showed variations in response to water availability, indicating the influence of environmental conditions on the relative proportion of certain fungal genera in Norway spruce trees. In the root mycobiome, key fungi such as Phialocephala fortinii and Paraphaeosphaeria neglecta were identified as conferring inhibitory effects against H. parviporum growth in Norway spruce genotypes. Furthermore, certain endophytes demonstrated greater stability in root ecosystems under low water conditions than ectomycorrhizal fungi. This knowledge can contribute to developing sustainable forest management practices that enhance the well-being of trees and their ecosystems, ultimately bolstering forest resilience.

AB  - In tropical forests, several studies have explored the effects of environmental factors and tree species diversity as well as functional trait diversity and trait composition on aboveground biomass (AGB) stock. However, these abiotic and biotic effects on individual biomass variability (BioVar) are still largely unexplored, which limits our understanding of the plant-plant interactions for species coexistence. Here, we used the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Models (PLS-SEMs), and other complementary analyses, on data from 189 tropical forest plots in Sri Lanka, to test the linkages amongst climate (a latent variable of solar radiation and potential evapotranspiration), soil (pH and cation exchange capacity), plot (plot size and stand density) conditions, big sized trees, species-functional diversity, and BioVar. The PLS-SEMs showed that climate conditions decreased BioVar directly but increased indirectly via integrative promoting direct effects on soil conditions, species functional diversity and big-sized trees. In contrast, soil conditions increased BioVar directly but decreased indirectly via integrative suppressing direct effects on species-functional diversity and big-sized trees. Interestingly, we found that the divergent indirect effects of climate and soil conditions on BioVar via big-sized trees mattered when the direct effect of big-sized trees on species-functional diversity was considered as compared to the reverse effect in PLS-SEMs. Also, the indirect positive effect of plot properties on BioVar was nearly equal to the direct effect because plot properties affected big-sized trees as similar as or lower than species-functional diversity. The positive effect of species-functional diversity on BioVar was mediated by the structural attributes of big-sized trees, indicating increased plant species co-existence. This study suggests that individual tree biomass variability (i.e., BioVar) should be considered for managing natural tropical forests in the context of the plant-plant interactions for species coexistence.

AB  - Canopy gaps play a crucial role in forest dynamic processes and help preserve biodiversity, influence nutrient cycles, and maintain the complex structure of the forests. This study aimed to quantify the gap dynamics, regeneration establishment, and gap closure in a natural old-growth Hyrcanian forest in the north of Iran. We used a repeated inventory of gap size-frequency and fraction in beech (Fagus orientalis) dominant forest over a 9-year interval (2010-2019). The total gap area documented in 2010, 2016, and 2019 was 2,487, 6,890, and 8,864 m(2), respectively. The gap area ranged from the smallest sizes of 139, 83, and 153 m(2) to the largest sizes 906, 1,668, and 871 m(2) in 2010, 2016, and 2019, respectively. Gap fraction significantly increased from 0.52%, 1.93%, and 3.7% in 2010, 2016, and 2019, respectively. The size distribution of gaps was strongly skewed to the medium class (200-500 m(2)), with approximately 60% of the gaps. Results revealed that total regenerations are not in correlation with gap size. Small gaps were closed within a few years through rapid horizontal canopy expansion of neighboring beech trees. The gap closure rate decreased by increasing the gap size (70% in 71 m(2) to 10% in 1,600 m(2)). The highest density and greatest regeneration growth occurred mostly along the eastern part of gaps. The spatial distributions of regeneration density demonstrated differences in different gap size classes, which probably resulted from heterogeneity in the microenvironment within the gap and the differences in the regeneration responses to these variations. This investigation provided useful data for managing natural regenerations based on forest sustainability. The changes in gap patterns observed between 2010 and 2019 highlight the high value of repeated gap inventories for better comprehending the disturbance regeneration and dynamics of natural gaps.

AB  - Allometric models which are used to describe the structure of trees in agroforestry systems are usually extrapolated from models developed for trees in forest ecosystems. This makes quantitative assessment of the functions of shade trees in agroforestry systems challenging since increased availability of light and space in these systems may induce structural differences from those growing under forest conditions. We addressed this issue by providing species-specific allometric information on the structural characteristics of associated shade trees on cocoa agroforestry systems and assessed if allometries conformed to theoretical predictions. At the plot level, stand and soil characteristics affecting tree structural characteristics were assessed. The study was conducted in cocoa agroforestry systems at Suhum, Ghana. The height-diameter at breast height (H-DBH) allometry had the best fits (R-2 = 53-89%), followed by the crown area (CA)-DBH allometry (R-2 = 27-87%) and then the CA-H allometry (R-2 = 22-73%). In general, the scaling exponents of the CA-DBH, H-CA and H-DBH allometries conformed to the metabolic scaling theory (MST). However, both the CA-DBH and H-DBH allometries diverged from the geometric similarity model. Though forest tree species had similar crown areas as fruit trees, they were slenderer than fruit trees. Tree slenderness coefficients were positively correlated with soil P, Ca, Cu and the ratios (Ca + Mg):K, (Ca + Mg):(K + Na) and Ca:Mg, but not C:N while DBH and H were correlated with soil P and C:N ratio. Our results show that critical soil nutrients and their ratios affects shade tree structural attributes (e.g. slenderness and CA), which possibly restrict variations in species-specific allometries to a narrow range on cocoa systems. Furthermore, shade tree species richness and density are better predictors of relative canopy projection area (a proxy for shade intensity) than tree species diversity. In conclusion, the results have implications for shade tree species selection, monitoring of woody biomass and maintenance of biodiversity.

AB  - High frequency burned area (BA) images provide an opportunity to monitor rangeland fire frequency (FF). This study related grass aboveground biomass (AGB) to FF in a 4800 ha biodiversity conservation savannah-grassland rangeland. Archived (2000-2021), 500 m resolution MODIS burned area monthly images were used. Following Boolean coding (fire event pixel = 1, no-fire pixel = 0), addition GIS overlay analysis yielded total fires per pixel location. Fire detection accuracy was assessed using 2018-2021 management fire event records. Sample grass AGB data were obtained at the end of the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons from widely dispersed sampling sites with wide grass cover uniformity, where a 1 m quadrat was tossed randomly in a 20 m x 20 m plot up to three times. The quadrat-enclosed grass was harvested to soil level, air-dried, and weighed to generate site average AGB values, which were correlated with vegetation index (VI) values from sampling near-concurrent surface reflectance (L2SP) Landsat-8 OLI images. Four biomass-sensitive VIs utilising Landsat sensor spectral ranges were tested. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) yielded the strongest relationship (r = 0.410, p < 0.01). A linear model predicting grass AGB from EVI values was developed using 58% of sample data for training (R (2) = 0.3062, p < 0.01) and 42% for validation (R (2) = 0.5225, p < 0.001). Using the model, sampling site historical grass AGB values were predicted on same season, L2SP Landsat (TM, ETM+, OLI) images from 2000, 2002, 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016, whose dates were selected by comparing rainfall. The MODIS images detected 73% of fires larger than 25 ha (one pixel). Most sites experienced long-term AGB gains, at faster rates in high FF (4-5 fires), low grazing sites. Most fires occurred as ecologically undesired late burns, indicating the utility of archived high-frequency BA images for rangeland management

AB  - Forest loss in the tropics affects large areas, but whereas full forest conversions are routinely assessed, forest degradation patters remain often unclear. This is particularly so for the world's tropical dry forests, where remote sensing of forest disturbances is challenging due to high canopy complexity, strong phenology and climate variability, and diverse degradation drivers. Here, we used the full depth of the Landsat archive and devised an approach to detect disturbances related to forest degradation across the entire Argentine Dry Chaco (about 489,000 km(2)) over a 30-year timespan. We used annual time series of different spectral indices, summarized for three seasonal windows, and applied LandTrendr to temporally segment each time series. The resulting pixellevel forest disturbance metrics then served as input for a Random Forests classification which we used to produce an area-wide disturbance map, and associated yearly area estimates of disturbed forest. Finally, we evaluated disturbance trends in relation to climate and soil conditions. Our best model produced a disturbance map with an overall accuracy of 79%, with a balanced error distribution. A total of 8% (24,877 +/- 860 km(2)) of the remaining forest in the Argentine Dry Chaco have been affected by forest disturbances between 1990 and 2017. Diverse spatial patterns of forest disturbances indicate a variety of agents driving disturbances. We also found the disturbed area to vary strongly between years, with larger areas being disturbed during drought years. Our approach shows that it is possible to robustly map forest disturbances in tropical dry forests using Landsat time series, and demonstrates the value of ensemble approaches to capture spectrally-complex and heterogeneous land-change processes. For the Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot, our analyses provide the first Landsat-based assessment of forest disturbance in remaining forests, highlighting the need to better consider such disturbances in assessments of carbon budgets and biodiversity change.

AB  - Episodes of forest mortality attributed to extreme climate variability (e.g. droughts, heatwaves) associated with climate change are increasingly reported in most biomes. The severity and extent of the mortality are also modulated by soils and topography characteristics and the presence of other disturbances such as pests, pathogens, wildfires, windthrow, and past management. Palaeoecological and historical information show that drought-induced forests shifts have occurred in the past in many regions. However, anthropogenic causes are key determinants in current drought-induced transformations of forests to non-forested ecosystems.
   The role of forest mortality leading to forest collapse is poorly understood, especially given the lack of long-term ecological surveys. In the short term, we find that an alternate set of species usually takes over the previously dominant tree species in temperate and boreal forests, through gap dynamics.
   In our global review, trees are replaced by shrubs in 34% of the cases studied and by grasses in 10% of the cases, pointing to characteristics of forest collapse in the latter more extreme case. Overall these episodes promote a wide array of changes framed in a successional context, usually towards more xeric and herbaceous vegetation. The eventual forest dynamics are largely defined by the historical context and particularly by human management, in which to a large extent determines the species pool, forest structure, and regeneration patterns.
   Early warning signals of ecosystem shifts based on long-term monitoring and statistics appear essential to anticipate forest collapse. Remote sensing tools constitute a powerful tool for the assessment of changes in forest functional properties. However, when analysing forest dynamics and processes based on biodiversity, the information provided by remote sensing merits further research. We find limited evidence of widespread forest collapse at the global scale, but ongoing mortality events represent a "window to the future" to understand forest resilience in light of increased frequency of climatic extremes.

AB  - Old-growth tropical forests provide an essential climate regulation service to humans, functioning as carbon (C) sink due to the high productivity, species diversity, and variety of life forms, such as bamboos. Bamboos growth fast and display plastic functional traits, which favor the occupation of environments under different conditions, making them efficient C stockers in addition to providing raw material for local human populations. Asian bamboos are known to sequester considerable amounts of C in a short time, and although is likely that New World bamboo species have the same capacity, this perspective is rarely addressed. To evaluate the impact of a native bamboo on biomass and carbon stocks of an Atlantic Forest Protected Area, we first developed an allometric equation to estimate its live aboveground biomass (AGB) based on the destructive sampling method. We then compare our results to the AGB of forest components previously estimated for the same area, as well as to Asian and other Neotropical bamboo species to place our case study in a global scenario. In four 1-ha permanent plots in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, we made a census of all live culms and collected 20 healthy ones for equations purposes. The Merostachys neesii Rupr. (Poaceae) studied species has 343 clumps ha(-1), 3663 culms ha(-1), and 12.1 Mg ha(-1) of biomass (5.2 Mg C ha(-1)) or 4% of total AGB and C stocks of the studied area. M. neesii's contributes as much as palms solely, but more than lianas and tree ferns together for the total AGB in the old-growth Montane Atlantic Forest we studied. These results show that the non-inclusion of bamboos may underestimate the role of terrestrial ecosystems in buffering anthropogenic CO2. The comprehension of bamboo ecology is crucial for conservation and management purposes, and it is relevant since, with global warming, the C stored may be released turning these ecosystems into source instead of a sink of C.

AB  - Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world, with 17,000 islands of varying sizes and elevations, from lowlands to very high mountains, stretching more than 5000 km eastward from Sabang in Aceh to Merauke in Papua. Although occupying only 1.3% of the world's land area, Indonesia possesses the third-largest rainforest and the second-highest level of biodiversity, with very high species diversity and endemism. However, during the last two decades, Indonesia has been known as a country with a high level of deforestation, a producer of smoke from burning forests and land, and a producer of carbon emissions. The aim of this paper is to review the environmental history and the long process of Indonesian forest management towards achieving environmental sustainability and community welfare. To do this, we analyze the milestones of Indonesian forest management history, present and future challenges, and provide strategic recommendations toward a viable Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) system. Our review showed that the history of forestry management in Indonesia has evolved through a long process, especially related to contestation over the control of natural resources and supporting policies and regulations. During the process, many efforts have been applied to reduce the deforestation rate, such as a moratorium on permitting primary natural forest and peat land, land rehabilitation and soil conservation, environmental protection, and other significant regulations. Therefore, these efforts should be maintained and improved continuously in the future due to their significant positive impacts on a variety of forest areas toward the achievement of viable SFM. Finally, we conclude that the Indonesian government has struggled to formulate sustainable forest management policies that balance economic, ecological, and social needs, among others, through developing and implementing social forestry instruments, developing and implementing human resource capacity, increasing community literacy, strengthening forest governance by eliminating ambiguity and overlapping regulations, simplification of bureaucracy, revitalization of traditional wisdom, and fair law enforcement.

AB  - The post-fire hydrological processes depend on both land use and soil condition (burned or not). This study aims at understanding the variability of the water infiltration, surface runoff and erosion in burned soils under different land uses (forestland and cropland) in comparison to unburned sitesTo this aim, infiltration, runoff and soil losses after a wildfire in two pine and oak forests, and a cropland are evaluated in Zagros forests (Western Iran) using a portable rainfall simulator. This area represents one of the lands with the highest biodiversity and naturalistic value of the entire Middle East, but no similar hydrological evaluations have been conducted so far. The difference in infiltration between the burned and unburned sites under the three land uses was not significant (on the average less than 10%). The runoff and erosion due to the wildfire noticeably increased in the forestland (+95% and 60%, respectively) and slightly decreased in the cropland (-16% and -20%) in comparison to the unburned sites. In the burned croplands erosion requires much attention, because the soil loss is on an average 30-fold compared to the values measured in the forestland. This increase may be even higher, since the rainsplash erosion could be underestimated and the rill or gully erosion was not considered due to the use of a portable rainfall simulator. Therefore, the study suggests the adoption of suitable strategies in croplands of the Zagros forests, in order to limit the negative impacts of high-intensity fires and hydrogeological events. Overall, the study has provided an insight to improve the knowledge on soil hydrology under different land uses and soil conditions. This evaluation helps landscape planners to select the most suitable anti-erosive actions against erosion in fire-affected areas without any needs of long monitoring field campaigns or model implementation.

AB  - The concept of microbial functional genes has added a new dimension to microbial ecology research by improving the model of microbial community-ecosystem functions relationship. However, our knowledge vis-a-vis fine-scale spatial distribution pattern of functional genes and their probable impact on plant community in the hyper-diverse tropical forest ecosystem is very limited. Here, we investigated the spatial pattern of functional genes abundance (NirK, AOA, AOB, and PhoD), identified key influencing factors, and distinguished the key functional group supporting the plant community in a tropical rainforest located in Xishuangbanna. In total, 200 soil samples and vegetation data of similar to 4800 individuals of plants across a 1 ha study area were collected. Our results detected higher spatial variability with a maximum magnitude of abundance for PhoD gene (4.53 x 10(7) copies) followed by NirK (2.71 x 10(6) copies), AOA (1.97 x 10(6) copies), and AOB (7.38 x 10(4) copies). A strong spatial dependence was observed for PhoD and NirK over the distance of 17 and 18 m, respectively. Interestingly, the N:P stoichiometry played a critical role in structuring the spatial pattern of the most abundant PhoD gene. The significant positive and negative relationship of PhoD with N: P ratio and available phosphorus, respectively, indicated that the P-limiting environment was a driving factor for recruitment of PhoD gene community. The structural equation modeling ascertained the direct positive impact of PhoD on plant biomass and high demand of available P by plants suggesting that the organic phosphorus mineralization process is essential to maintain plant productivity by re-establishing the availability of the most limiting P nutrient. Our preliminary study improves our understanding of how microbial functional genes-environment associations could be used for monitoring soil health and its overall impact on ecosystem multifunctionality. Finally, we intend to conduct the study at a large spatial scale for achieving a holistic view.

AB  - Background: In Cerrado humid areas, veredas are considered as hygrophilous communities, marked by the presence of the Mauritia flexuosa palm tree emerging in the wetter zones. Changes in veredas ecosystems due to drought and changes in the water table, which represent important areas for biodiversity maintenance in the Brazilian cerrado, can lead to the emergence of new landscapes and ecosystems. Assuming that the veredas are changed in species composition due to anthropogenic factors, in this study, we evaluated the flora composition and described the current vegetation profile of two veredas under different disturbances levels that are located in the north of Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Results: Altogether, 2,268 individuals of 91 species belonging to 36 families were recorded. Our results demonstrated that the studied veredas were floristically different in terms of the arboreous-shrubby species composition, richness, and diversity. Despite the hygrophilous forest formations and open areas in the two veredas present typical species from these environments (same species with high importance values), the drought in the water table caused an expansion of Cerrado species in the open areas and in the hygrophilous forest. Furthermore, in the hygrophilous forest there was an increase in the abundance of species that occur in less saturated soils. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that the studied veredas are changing in species composition due to anthropogenic factors which leads to the drought of these formations (water balance effect). These anthropogenic effects cause a modification with the expansion and increase in the abundance of typical species of other areas of Cerrado and resistant to less saturated soils, leading to the veredas collapse. Finally, future studies should investigate other veredas on a broader scale to detect changes in the water table that lead to a consequent change in vegetation structure. In this way, we will have support for the conscientious management and conservation of these areas that represent equilibrium places for the Cerrado biome.

AB  - Brazil has become the world leader in soy production, leading to an increase in the conversion of the Amazon rainforest into cropland. These actions had consequences for Forest's biodiversity, including the soil. In this sense, a better understanding of how long-term land use affects soil microbial communities, and their functions is urgent. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term land-use effects over bacterial and archaeal communities in soil and soybean rhizosphere in the Amazon region. For this, mesocosms experiments were carried out with Amazon soils with a history of 2-, 8-, and 20-years of agricultural use. We then assessed the bacterial and archaeal communities based on the 16S rRNA sequencing and real-time PCR. Our results showed a distinct bacterial community structure in soils with 20-years of land use. For both, bulk soil and soybean rhizosphere with 20-years of use, there was an increase in the abundance of Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes. Interestingly, the niche occupancy analysis revealed an increase of specialist microbes in these soils. Also, these soils with 20-years of use showed a more complex network for both bulk and rhizosphere samples, highlighting the importance of Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi phyla to soil network structure. Our analysis also revealed an increased abundance of total bacteria, N-fixers, and ammonia-oxidizers bacteria in rhizosphere soil with 20-years of use. In addition, based on the potential functional analysis, nitrification processes increased in those soils. However, we noticed a homogenization in the abundance of the genes between rhizosphere and bulk soil with 20-years of use. In general, the differences were associated with changes in soil chemical characteristics such as pH, Ca2+, Mg2+, and organic matter, which are a consequence of liming and no till practices over time. Our findings demonstrate that long-term agriculture in Amazon soils affects microbial community composition and functions, bringing new insights to better understand anthropogenic actions over the soil microbiome.

AB  - Identifying how past human actions have influenced their environment is essential for understanding the ecological factors that structure contemporary ecosystems. Intertidal resource use by Indigenous Peoples for thousands of years has led to habitation sites containing vast shell midden deposits and facilitating long-term impacts on soil chemistry and drainage. Here we examine how these shell middens have impacted various forest metrics, such as species diversity, community composition, canopy height, and regeneration recruitment to determine if forests on habitation sites differ from the surrounding matrix. We surveyed known habitation sites with archeological evidence indicating past year-round human occupation, within the Hakai Luxvbalis Conservancy on Calvert and Hecate Islands within the Great Bear Rainforest along British Columbia's Central Coast. Our results demonstrate that habitation sites exhibit lower tree species richness, less relative species abundances, as such, displayed lower Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson values. The composition of tree communities on habitation sites was statistically different, with western hemlock and western redcedar densities increasing on non-habitation sites. Conversely, regeneration diversity at habitation sites was more even and exhibited elevated Shannon diversity and inverse Simpson values. The community composition of regeneration was more consistent among habitation and non-habitation sites; however, western redcedar, western hemlock and Sitka spruce were more abundant at habitation sites. For all tree species, maximum height was higher within the habitation sites; however, this trend was the most notable in western redcedar and Sitka spruce, which increased by an average of 4.8 m relative to non-habitation sites. Collectively, our findings suggest that long-term habitation alters forest community compositions. The landscape alterations within habitation sites promote conditions needed to support diverse, even, and abundant regeneration communities and consequently increase the height of the dominant coastal tree species. Thus, our results offer evidence that long-term influence by Indigenous communities have a persistent influence on coastal forests.

AB  - The most spread groundwater-dependent ecosystems in the River Po valley are semi-natural lowland springs called "fontanili". They provide specific habitats and support high biodiversity, but are often strongly impaired by agricultural pollution. In the present study we seasonally monitored the discharge and nitrogen concentration of 48 fontanili from the Adda and the Ticino river basins. We observed a wide spatial variability of both NO3-N concentrations and flows. The annual NO3-N loads ranged from <1 to 75 t y(-1) and < 1 to 29 t y(-1) in the Adda and Ticino basins respectively. In the springs characterized by variable discharge the N loads were exported mostly during the summer season when water table level was elevated mainly due to irrigation. Upscaling the mean NO3- N load to each river catchment based on the total number of springs, we obtained an aerial export of 33.2 +/- 6.0 and 12.5 +/- 3.2 kg y(-1) ha(-1). Such loads accounted for the 30.4 and 21.5% of the N surplus estimated for the Adda and Ticino basins respectively.
   Random Forest analysis was performed to identify the most important environmental variables influencing the nitrate contamination in the spring waters. A total of 22 explanatory variables related to N sources, land uses, intrinsic hydrogeologic and soil proprieties, in "situ" and remotely sensed variables were considered. The percent of soil cultivated with maize in a 500 m radius buffer area surrounding the sampling site, the N from manure and the distance of each spring from the main river were the most effective factors in controlling the NO3-N concentration in the fontanili water. The outcomes of this work open up to achievable management prospects for the protection and recovery of fontanili waters, and can be particularly useful for water managers in identifying areas and sites where restoration plans should be a priority.

AB  - Introduction of drought-tolerant exotic tree species is seen as an important adaptation measure of forest management to climate change in Central Europe. Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is particularly favored in this context, because it is adapted to summer droughts due to the climate in its natural distribution range in temperate western North America and it is also fast-growing and the wood is readily marketable. In Germany, there are plans to grow Douglas fir on a large scale in mixed forests with other tree species on acidic soils. Potential ecological consequences have not yet been sufficiently scrutinized. Here, we analyze effects of Douglas fir introduction into forests of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), which would naturally predominate Central Europe's forests. We analyzed vascular plant diversity and species composition of the ground vegetation in a gradient with increasing Douglas fir canopy fraction that ranged from pure beech (0% Douglas fir) via mixed stands (25%, 50%, 75% Douglas fir) to pure (100%) Douglas fir forest. Species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity increased with increasing Douglas fir canopy fraction. However, this increase was primarily driven by an increase of nitrogen-tolerant disturbance indicators, whereas the share of forest species that were predominant in pure beech forests decreased. Beech forest species declined gradually with increasing Douglas fir canopy fraction, but these declining species were fewer than the number of species increasing due to Douglas fir introduction. Cover of similar to 30% of species remained constant when Douglas fir was introduced. Strong changes in the ground vegetation were observed at Douglas fir canopy fractions > 40 - 50% and the original character of the ground vegetation was completely lost beyond a threshold of 75%. Therefore, we discourage from high Douglas fir proportions beyond these thresholds in production forests and from any introduction of Douglas fir where nature conservation is a priority.

AB  - Aim: The soil seed bank is a key component of the biodiversity of plant communities, but various aspects of its functioning in temperate forest ecosystems are still unknown. We here adopted a trait-based approach to investigate the effects of macro-and microclimatic gradients on the juvenile plant communities from the realized seed bank of two types of European temperate forest.
   Location: Oak-dominated forests in Italy and Belgium.
   Methods: We analysed the variation of key functional traits (plant height, leaf area, leaf dry weight, specific leaf area and leaf number) of juvenile plants from the realised soil seed bank in relation to elevation (from 0 to 800 m a. s.l.), forest type (thinned and unthinned forest) and distance to the forest edge. We translocated soil samples from the forest core to the edge (and vice versa) and from high-to low-elevation forests to test the effects of edge and warming respectively.
   Results: Taller communities developed at the forest edge due to higher light availability and warmer temperatures. The translocation from the core to the edge did not significantly modify mean trait values. Instead, the shadier and cooler microclimate of the forest core reduced the mean leaf area, mean dry weight, height and leaf number in the communities realised from the edge soil. The translocation from high-to lowland forests led to increased values for all traits (except specific leaf area). Edge vs core trait variation was more driven by intraspecific variability, whereas the translocation from high-to low-elevation forests caused trait changes mostly due to species turnover.
   Conclusions: Global warming might result in a functional shift of the understorey due to both an early filtering effect on the seedlings from soil seed banks and their adaptive trait adjustments to temperature increase. Furthermore, our study underpins the importance of edge vs core microclimate in driving the functional composition of the realised soil seed bank.

AB  - The future climate of northern temperate forests is projected to be drier and warmer by the end of this century. As a result, more drought-induced forest dieback events are anticipated in northeastern North America, and assessing the vulnerability of dominant tree species to drought is critical for understanding the future compo-sition of these forests. In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed two-year-old seedlings of Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P. and Pinus strobus L. to three future climate treatments for southern Quebec, Canada, and evaluated their mortality, growth, and foliage water status responses to soil water availability and atmospheric drought. Using a unique approach, climate treatments emulated droughts of different frequencies, durations, and intensities. Treatments closely simulated one growing season, with changes in air temperature and relative humidity every six hours and daily adjustment in the amount of water delivered to the seedlings. The three species experienced high mortality (75%) in all water-limited treatments compared to a control treatment that provided non-limiting soil moisture (0% mortality). The biomass of the seedlings that survived was 40% lower than that of control seedlings. Our results confirmed that the hydraulic safety margins, defined as the difference between seasonal minimum water potential and xylem water potential leading to 12, 50 and 88% of hydraulic conductivity loss, were good predictors of probability of tree mortality. Therefore, hydraulic safety margins are useful functional traits that can be used to compare the vulnerability of various species to drought and then provide crucial information to practitioners and policymakers to adjust forest management to climate change. We showed that three dominant conifer species of northern temperate forests were highly vulnerable to drought in future climates. Because drought is projected to be a significant threat to forests, understanding potentially adaptive physiological responses to drought, such as hydraulic safety margins of tree seedlings, is important for predicting the response of forest regeneration and composition in warmer and drier climates.

AB  - Once fire-resistant rainforests are becoming fire prone. Uncontrolled fires reflect new ecologies of the Anthropocene, driven by interactions of multiple actors and sectors across scales. They threaten the ecological integrity of tropical forests, impact global climate regimes and importantly cause considerable social and economic burdens. Numerous smallholder farming communities throughout the forested tropics experience the immediate place-based damages of uncontrolled fires and increasingly flammable landscapes. However, these burdens remain largely 'invisible' as leading narratives concentrate on losses accrued at aggregate scales, including to climate and biodiversity. Rather, smallholder farmers are often cast as culprits of contagion rooted in colonial condemnation of their customary fire-based agricultural practices. We use an environmental justice lens, notably the dimensions of recognition and distribution, to reveal the distributional burdens of uncontrolled fires for these land managers. We use empirical data from four case studies in three countries: Brazil, Madagascar and the Philippines, to explore the i) burdens of uncontrolled fire, ii) changing risks, iii) drivers and iv) responses to uncontrolled fire, and finally, the v) level of smallholder dependence on intentional fire. We show that place-based burdens of uncontrolled landscape fire are significant, including in landscapes where fire frequency is low. Burdens are both material and non-material and include infringements on food security, health, livelihoods, social relations and the burden of prohibitive fire policy itself. Equitable responses to uncontrolled fires must be sensitive to the distinctions between fire types. Further, we suggest that through bringing visibility to the place-based burdens of uncontrolled fires, we can begin to co-design resilient responses that avoid placing the final burden of risk reduction on to marginalized smallholder farming communities.

AB  - Brazilian mangroves cover about 11,100 km(2) and provide a wide range of ecosystem services. Despite their importance, they are one of the most impacted ecosystems because of combined influences of climate change, pollution, and direct conversion and loss. A major driver of environmental impacts is shrimp farming and this is particularly acute in the semi-arid northeast of Brazil, where mangroves are constrained in a narrow band along ephemeral estuaries that are often impacted by multi-year droughts. Recent changes to Brazilian law, in particular the Forest Code, have weakened protection for mangroves and associated "apicum" (salt pan) ecosystems. In NE Brazil, most shrimp ponds are converted from mangrove-adjacent "apicuns" rather than the mangroves themselves with periodic hydrological connectivity through dammed channels, allowing the flushing of effluents. As a result, the main impacts on mangroves are typically indirect, because of pollution inputs from shrimp pond effluents and associated loss of ecosystem services including reductions in primary productivity, carbon storage capacity, resilience to other environmental stressors, their efficiency as estuarine filters, and biodiversity and abundance of subsistence use of marine species. Soil damage and infrastructure remaining after shrimp pond deactivation impairs mangrove recovery. This extends the duration of the damage and allows the occupation of degraded areas by other activities that can permanently impair ecosystem function. In this review, we address several aspects of the shrimp culture boom in NE Brazilian, their features and consequences, and the future of mangroves in the region considering climate change and rising poverty. Our conclusions on the practices and outcomes of shrimp farming in mangroves are likely to apply to areas with similar environmental settings, e.g., semiarid regions worldwide, and particularly in the Latin America and Caribbean region, and our findings can be taken into account to improve conservation and management of these forests at the least to a regional scale.

AB  - Questions How is community functional composition associated with environmental and historical factors and how is this relationship mediated by spatial and phylogenetic autocorrelation? Location Atlantic Forest of South America. Methods We compiled abundance data of 2,122 species (most trees) distributed across 281 communities, seven functional traits, and 29 environmental and historical predictors. We mapped traits using community-weighted means, and related traits to predictors by combining the fourth-corner and the extended RLQ approaches. Results We found that decreases in rainfall, soil nutrition, biome stability in the last 120 kyr, and the increase in thermal variability were associated with high specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf N content, and reduced leaf thickness. In addition, increased temperature and soil sand content, and low biome stability in the last 21 kyr were associated with high wood density and leaf dry matter content, and reduced maximum plant height. Tree communities rich in taxa with N-rich thin leaves and high SLA were mostly located in semideciduous and deciduous forests (e.g., Fabaceae), while communities rich in taxa with N-poor thick leaves and low SLA were mostly found in rain forests (e.g., Myrtaceae and Lauraceae). Species with short stature, high wood density and heavy leaves were particularly abundant in the northern part of the Atlantic Forest (e.g., Myrtaceae), whereas tall species with light wood and leaves were abundant in the south (e.g., Lauraceae). There was not a particular direction in which seed dry mass increased most in response to predictors. Conclusions Our study reinforces the view that the multifaceted nature of community assembly needs analytical approaches that integrate abundance, functional, phylogenetic, and spatial data to properly understand how environmental and historical factors determine the dominance of functional traits. The observed patterns suggest that different regions of a given biome function in different ways, and probably provide different ecosystem services.

AB  - The urban environment is stressful and trees experience multiple stresses, including drought, flooding, and extreme heat, all of which are likely to increase under future climate warming and increasing urbanisation. In the selection of tree species to maximise ecosystem services, tolerance to site characteristics such as flooding and severe drought is of critical importance. This study evaluated the suitability of a rare species, Mims subcordata C.A. Mey (Caucasian alder) from the Hyrcanian forests of southern Azerbai-jan, for its functionality as an urban tree.
   A total of 48 pot-grown, two-year-old saplings of A. subcordata were tested in a greenhouse experiment using a complete randomised block design. Each block contained four replicates of three treatments (waterlogging, drought, control), with 16 plants per treatment. Height differences between treatments were measured, and water status was estimated by determination of midday leaf water potential (psi(L)) and stomatal conductance (g(s)). To estimate drought tolerance reaction in the treatments, leaf water potential at turgor loss (psi(P0)) was used together with broken-stick modelling of water status over time.
   A. subcordata plants showed no height increase, while plants in both the waterlogged and control treatments increased in height during the nine-week experiment. Over 63 days of flooding, plant water status was slightly more negative in the waterlogging treatment, but did not deviate essentially from the control. In the drought treatment, plant water status rapidly deviated from the control. There was a significant difference in psi(P0) between treatments, with drought-treated plants showing the lowest value (-2.31 MPa).
   This study demonstrated that A. subcordata has limited tolerance to drought and seems to rely more on water loss-avoiding strategies. However, the species may be usable at periodically waterlogged sites, due to its high tolerance to flooding. It could therefore be recommended for wet urban environments and stormwater management facilities, for which reliable guidance on suitable trees is currently lacking.

AB  - Research Highlights: Rare, or sparsely distributed, species drive the floristic diversity of upland, terra firme and seasonally flooded forests in the central Jurua-a remote and hitherto floristically poorly known area in the Brazilian Amazon. Background and Objectives: Floristic inventories are critical for modelling and understanding the role of Amazonian forests in climate regulation, for sustainable management of forest resources and efficient conservation planning. Yet, detailed information about the often complex spatial distributions of many Amazonian woody plants is limited. Here, we provide information about forest structure and species composition from a remote terra firme forest and an adjacent floodplain forest in the western Brazilian Amazon. More specifically, we ask (1) how floristically different are the terra firme and floodplain forests? and (2) how variable is species composition within the same forest type? Materials and Methods: Between September 2016 and October 2017, we inventoried 97 plots (each 0.1 ha; 100 x 10 m) placed at least 800 m apart, with 46 plots in terra firme forest and 51 in seasonally flooded forest. We included all trees, hemi-epiphytes and palms with diameter at breast height (dbh) > 10 cm and woody lianas > 5 cm dbh. We examine forest structure, family- and species-level floristic composition and species diversity within and between forest types using family and species importance values, rarefaction curves and dissimilarity matrices. Results: Terra firme forest and seasonally flooded forest woody plant communities differ both in structure and species composition, which was highly variable within forest types. Many species were shared between terra firme and seasonally flooded forests, but most species were forest type-specific. Whereas species richness was greatest in the terra firme forest, floodplain species richness was among the highest regionally. Conclusions: Floodplain forests are a crucial complement to terra firme forests in terms of Amazonian woody plant diversity.

AB  - In Europe, forest area is increasing. These recently established forests can be classified into regenerating after disturbances or expanding into agricultural areas after abandonment. We used European Space Agency land cover maps and MODIS data to investigate which socioenvironmental drivers influenced recent forest expansion and regeneration in Europe from 1992 to 2015 and to compare their productivity by means of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). Our results showed that forest area increased in Europe by 1.4% from 1992 to 2015. The 66% of this forest area increase corresponded to forest expansion mostly in Mediterranean and temperate regions, while regeneration (34%) dominated in boreal areas. Forest area and land cover diversity in 1992 were the main drivers of local forest area increase from 1992 to 2015. Forest expansion occurred on the warmer zones far from urban areas in the boreal region while it was the opposite in temperate and Mediterranean areas. On the other hand, forest regeneration showed mostly a positive relation with the distance to urban areas and water availability but no relation with temperature. The EVI values in 2015 were higher in expanding than in regenerating forests except in the warmer and drier bioclimates of Europe. These EVI trends suggest a higher productivity of expanding forests, except in areas where they cannot benefit from biological and physicochemical legacies of abandoned agricultural soils for tree growth, owing to water shortage. In sum, our results highlight that recent forest area increase in Europe is mostly caused by forest expansion into former agricultural areas but this is mostly occurring in less productive (warmer and drought-prone) bioclimates where advantages of agricultural legacies may not occur. Ultimately, this casts doubts whether there may be a limit for the role of forest expansion into agricultural areas for carbon sequestration in the long term.

AB  - Translocating topsoil from an appropriate donor forest is a promising strategy to restore seriously degraded sites. However, some dominant or constructive species did not survive due to plant stress in the seedling stage, which ultimately led to a poor community structure and low similarity between new communities and donor forest. In this study, we replaced the topsoil of karst rocky desertification with forest topsoil and imposed different shading and watering treatments following quadratic saturation D-optimum design. Richness, abundance, height and base diameter of woody species (trees + shrubs) were measured yearly to construct mathematical equation between them and shade degrees (SD) and water quantity (WQ) by using multiple stepwise regression. Results displayed a positive linear relationship between richness of woody species and SD at the second year of topsoil translocation, which changed to a parabolic relationship at the fifth year with a maximum 30.8 species when SD was 37.5 %. The positive linear relationship between density of woody species, shrubs and trees and SD at the second year transformed into a parabolic relationship at the fifth year, and density reached maximum 6.3, 3.7 and 3.8 seedlings/m(2) when SD were 41.7, 38.9 and 45.0%, respectively. In contrast, the density of Paliurus orientalis and Sophora viciifolia turned into a negative linear relationship with SD at the fifth year. Moreover, although the effect of SD and WQ on height of woody species increased over time, shading inhibited base diameter of shrubs and height of Quercus cocciferoides, Sapium sebiferum and Fraxinus malacophylla at the fifth year. We concluded that no-shading and heavy shading reduced species diversity, and light to moderate shading should be recommended in first 2-3 years after topsoil translocation to enhance woody species survival and accelerate similar forest community establishment providing guidance for the management, regeneration and restoration of native forest in semi-arid areas.

AB  - Acer amplum subsp. catalpifolium is a native deciduous broad-leaved tree species mainly distributed in the rainy zone of west China classified as critically endangered. Acid rain is a frequent phenomenon in this region and its impact on regional forests, especially for susceptible species have major implications on community stability and biodiversity conservation. To understand the basic physiological responses of A. amplum subsp. catalpifolium, an acid rain simulation experiment spanning 18 months was conducted. The aim is to determine the effects of acidity levels (pH 2.5, 3.5, and 4.5), chemical composition (H2SO4: HNO3 ratio of 7.5:1 and 5:4.1, respectively), and deposition patterns (soil addition and leaf spraying modes) on photosynthetic performance and stress status of A. amplum subsp. catalpifolium The results showed that simulated acid rain can enhance the peak photosynthetic rate (Pn) and stomatal conductance (Cs) in the diurnal variation of A. amplum subsp. catalpifolium under soil addition mode, and it is attributed to the increased net photosynthetic rate at the light saturation point (Amax), net photosynthetic rate at saturating CO2 concentration (Pmax) and various chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (phi PSII, Fv/Fm, Fv/ F0, and qP). On the contrary, the photosynthetic performance of A. amplum subsp. catalpifolium was significantly inhibited by acid rain under leaf spraying mode, with increased dark respiration rate (Rd) and photorespiration rate (Rp). The reduction levels in Amax and Pmax was higher in the nitric based acid rain compared to sulfuric acid dominant acid rain. In general, improved nutrient availability brought about by acid rain on soil promoted the photosynthetic performance of A. amplum subsp. catalpifolium. Meanwhile, acid rain in direct contact with the leaves negatively affects leaf performance and chemical makeup. Therefore, acid rain patterns (such as fog or snow) in direct contact with leaves should be accounted for in the protection of A. amplum subsp. catalpifolium.

AB  - As emerging pollutants, microplastics (MPs) are widely distributed in water, soil and atmosphere, and have become a popularly concerned environmental and social issue. The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs' potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m(-2) d(-1) or 0 to 1583 n m(-3). The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs' shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What's noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs' transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs' environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts.
   It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution.

AB  - Land use conflicts induced by human activities cause accelerated soil erosion. The response of soil erosion to spatial conflict in production-living-ecological space (PLES) is not clearly understood. In this research, models such as PLES spatial conflict, revised universal soil loss equation, bivariate spatial autocorrelation, and an optimal parameter-based geographical detector were used to explore the characteristics and drivers of soil erosion in response to spatial conflict in the PLES of the Dongting Lake watershed. Results show that spatial changes of the PLES first increased and then decreased. Approximately 45% of the area was consistently in moderate or higher conflict levels throughout the study period. The average soil erosion rate showed a decreasing trend for each year except in the period 2000-2005, when moderate erosion increased. The spatial correlation between spatial conflict and soil erosion was found to be in the form of an inverted "U" for the high-high and low-high agglomeration patterns, and a decreasing trend for the high-low ones. Approximately 27% of the area must be traded off between the spatial conflict of the PLES and soil erosion. The influence of GDP and population density was significant. DEM interacted strongly with GDP, NDVI, precipitation, population density, and "return of farmland to forest" policy. Different patterns were formed among the factors through actions such as amplification, mitigation, catalysis, and dependence effects. We propose policy recommendations based on the differences in the driving mechanisms of the respective models.

AB  - Context Accurately predicting microclimate is considered a high priority for understanding organismal responses to climate change at biologically relevant scales. However, approaches to developing robust microclimate datasets and understanding of the biophysical processes altering microclimatic regimes are limited. Objectives We developed and evaluated an approach for predicting microclimatic temperatures in montane forests that incorporates the influence of complex vegetation structure and landscape physiography. Additionally, we determined spatiotemporal mismatches between free-air and microclimatic temperatures to highlight the location, phenology, and magnitude of differences in predicted temperature. Methods We combined temperature datalogger measurements with LiDAR-derived vegetation and GIS-derived landscape physiographic characteristics to downscale free-air temperatures to microclimatic (3 m(2) spatial resolution) temperatures in the Great Smoky Mountains. We assessed the contribution of forest vegetation layers in altering microclimatic temperatures and model accuracy, and compared coarse-grain temperature maps with microclimatic temperature maps. Results Understory vegetation structure contributes to microclimatic buffering of near-surface, forest temperatures and enhances the accuracy of maximum temperature predictions during the growing season by altering the effects of solar insolation and topographic convergence index on microclimatic temperatures. Elevation and solar insolation covaried with spatiotemporal mismatches between free-air and microclimatic temperatures, suggesting that these landscape physiographic characteristics may contribute to deviations between macro- and micro-scale temperature. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the importance of including complex vegetation characteristics and biophysical interactions as climate forcing factors in microclimate modeling. We also demonstrate the plausibility of accurately predicting microclimatic temperatures over broad extents, an important step in predicting potential organismal responses to climate change.

AB  - Lona-term animal grazing and agricultural practices in the Central Anatolian Region have disturbed the vegetation cover and rendered the sites prone to erosion. Plantation practices have been carried out for about six decades in the region. However, tree-oriented plantation practices have not shown promising results. Thus, experimental data gathered in the region using new approaches with different plant species are urgently needed. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the potential usage of some of the ground-cover species for ecosystem restoration in the region. The seeds of 16 local species were collected during extensive field surveys in the summer and early fall of 2012 and 2013. Five sites scattered on the basin were chosen as experimental blocks. The area covers the driest part of the region, with less than 300 mm annual precipitation and 11 degrees C average temperature. Soil texture for the first 20 cm of soil depth in the experimental units ranges from clay to sandy clay loam, with a high lime content. In October 2012, April 2013, October 2013, and April 2014 seeds of these 16 species were sown on three 40 cm x 600 cm beds. In the spring and summer of 2013 and 2011, sites were visited, and field emergence rates and seedling growth were recorded. Based on the results of the experiment, Atriplex hortensis. Glaucium corniculatum, Marrubium pawiflorum, Onobrychis tournefortii, Peganum harmaia. Reseda lutea. Stachys cretica. Teucrium odium and Vicia cappadocica appear to be the most promising ground-cover spedes for ecosystem restoration in the region.

AB  - Seedling stage has long been recognized as the bottleneck of forest regeneration, and the biotic and abiotic processes that dominate at seedling stage largely affect the dynamics of forest. Seedlings might be particularly vulnerable to climate stress, so elucidating the role of interannual climate variation in fostering community dynamics is crucial to understanding the response of forest to climate change. Using seedling survival data of 69 woody species collected for five consecutive years from a 25-ha permanent plot in a temperate deciduous forest, we identified the effects of biotic interactions and habitat factors on seedling survival, and examined how those effects changed over time. We found that interannual climate variations, followed by biotic interactions and habitat conditions, were the most significant predictors of seedling survival. Understory light showed a positive impact on seedling mortality, and seedling survival responded differently to soil and air temperature. Effects of conspecific neighbor density were significantly strengthened with the increase of maximum air temperature and vapor pressure deficits in the growing season, but were weakened by increased maximum soil temperature and precipitation in the non-growing season. Surprisingly, seedling survival was strongly correlated with interannual climate variability at all life stages, and the strength of the correlation increased with seedling age. In addition, the importance of biotic and abiotic factors on seedling survival differed significantly among species-trait groups. Thus, the neighborhood-mediated effects on mortality might be significantly contributing or even inverting the direct effects of varying abiotic conditions on seedling survival, and density-dependent effects could not be the only important factor influencing seedling survival at an early stage.

AB  - The use of biomass from forests by humans has been practiced since the dawn of time. Such practices have resulted in severe watershed degradation historically and in today's world. As modern society seeks alternative energy sources, they are once again turning to forests, but now use mechanized harvesting systems to remove the biomass and transport it to processing or utilization sites. This study investigated the impacts of different mechanized biomass operations on sediment displacement, soil hydraulic conductivity, and canopy interception to determine if severe watershed impacts associated with biomass utilization in the northwest U.S.A. may occur as seen elsewhere. Three field sites were selected that used different biomass operation methods: the Payette National Forest (NF) in Idaho using a forwarder system, the Colville NF in Washington State using a tractor-skidder system, and the Flathead NF in Montana using a skyline system. A total of 47 silt fences (5 m x 10 m) were installed to monitor soil movement from biomass operations: 28 silt fences on disturbed plots and 19 on control plots. No soil loss was observed except on the forwarder trails in the Payette NF where animal disturbances were responsible for some soil movement into the silt fences. Infiltration rates measured using a constant head permeameter showed that the saturated hydraulic conductivity on the disturbed plots for the ground-based operations was lower than the control plots, but unlikely to cause significant changes in runoff on any of the plots except the Payette forwarder trails, where the saturated hydraulic conductivity values averaged only 5.3 mm h(-1), compared to greater than 20 mm h(-1) on all other observations. Ground cover increased on the disturbed plots to levels observed on undisturbed plots within two years. The only significant increase in bulk density was observed on the forwarder trails at the Payette NF site where the density averaged 1.41 on the trails, compared to the densities of 1.0 elsewhere. The loss of canopy observed on the three biomass studies led to a complementary study on the effects of canopy loss on snow accumulation and melt on the Priest River Experimental Forest in Northern Idaho. The study found that the canopy only intercepted an average of 7 mm of snow water equivalent during three winter months, but average annual interception of precipitation was 114 mm, indicating that interception of rainfall is greater than snow. Overall, these results suggest that there were no direct detrimental hydrologic impacts due to biomass operations except on the compacted, and sometimes pulverized forwarder trail conditions observed in the Payette NF. The impact of the canopy on rainfall interception is less than the water yield differences due to clear cutting on nearby forested watersheds that were attributed to differences in evapotranspiration.

AB  - In the past two decades, the Amazon-exposed, tropical montane rain forests in south Ecuador experienced increasing deposition of reactive N mainly from Amazonian forest fires, episodic Ca and Mg inputs from Saharan dust, and a low but constant P deposition from unknown sources. To explore the response of this tropical, perhumid ecosystem to nutrient inputs, we established in 2007 a Nutrient Manipulation Experiment (NUMEX). Since 2008, we have applied 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N as urea, 10 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of P as NaH2PO4 center dot H2O, 50 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N + 10 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of P and 10 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of Ca as CaCl2 center dot H2O in a randomized block design at 2000 m a.s.l. in a natural forest of the south Ecuadorian Andes. Previous studies have shown that alkali and alkaline earth metals had beneficial effects on the functioning of N and P co-limited tropical forests occurring on acidic soils. Therefore, we determined the response of all major aqueous ecosystem fluxes of K, Ca, Mg and Na to nutrient amendments, to understand how increasing atmospheric deposition would affect their cycling in the future. Additions of N and P decreased K leaching from the organic layer and in the mineral soil, thus tightening K cycling. This suggests that increasing future N and P availability may result in K limitation in the long term. The leaching of Ca and Mg from the canopy increased in response to amendments of N and P and we observed an enhanced uptake of these nutrients also if Ca was amended alone. Although N was applied as urea, acidity of soil solutions and leaching of K, Ca, Mg and Na did not increase following separate N amendments. In spite of the acid soils and of its low cation-exchange competitivity, Na included in the P fertilizer was only partly leached from the organic layer. We suggest that it was probably required to cover an unmet Na demand of the soil fauna. Our results demonstrate the major role in the functioning of the tropical montane forests played by K, Ca and Mg as potential future growth-limiting elements and increasingly required nutrients in response to rising N and P availability, while they also support the importance of Na as a functional element in these ecosystems.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewHarsher abiotic conditions are projected for many woodland areas, especially in already arid and semi-arid climates such as the Southwestern USA. Stomatal regulation of their aperture is one of the ways plants cope with drought. Interestingly, the dominant species in the Southwest USA, like in many other ecosystems, have different stomatal behaviors to regulate water loss ranging from isohydric (e.g., pinon pine) to anisohydric (e.g., juniper) conditions suggesting a possible niche separation or different but comparable strategies of coping with stress. The relatively isohydric pinon pine is usually presumed to be more sensitive to drought or less desiccation tolerant compared to the anisohydric juniper although both species close their stomata under drought to avoid hydraulic failure, and the mortality of one species (mostly pinon) over the other in the recent droughts can be attributed to insect outbreaks rather than drought sensitivity alone. Furthermore, no clear evidence exists demonstrating that iso- or anisohydric strategy increases water use efficiency over the other consistently. How these different stomatal regulatory tactics enable woody species to withstand harsh abiotic conditions remains a subject of inquiry to be covered in this review.Recent FindingsThis contribution reviews and explores the use of simplified stomatal optimization theories to assess how photosynthesis and transpiration respond to warming (H), drought (D), and combined warming and drought (H+D) for isohydric and anisohydric woody plants experiencing the same abiotic stressors. It sheds light on how simplified stomatal optimization theories can separate between photosynthetic and hydraulic acclimation due to abiotic stressors and how the interactive effects of H+D versus H or D alone can be incorporated into future climate models.SummaryThe work here demonstrates how field data can be bridged to simplified optimality principles so as to explore the effect of future changes in temperature and in soil water content on the acclimation of tree species with distinct water use strategies. The results show that the deviations between measurements and predictions from the simplified optimality principle can explain different species' acclimation behaviors.

AB  - Understanding the magnitude and cause of variation in tree growth and forest productivity is central to sustainable forest management. Measurements of annual growth rings allow assessments of individual-tree, tree population, and forest ecosystem vulnerabilities to drought stress or other changing forest disturbance regimes (insects, diseases, fire), which can be used to identify areas at greatest risk of forest losses. Given a heightened demand for tree-ring data, we consolidated and synthesized tree-ring studies and datasets gathered over the past 30 years in Canada by scientists with the Canadian Forest Service and research partners. We incorporated these datasets into a data repository that currently contains tree-ring measurements from 40 206 tree samples from 4594 sites and 62 tree species from all Canadian provinces and territories. Through our synthesis, we demonstrate the value of such large ensembles of tree-ring data for identifying patterns in tree growth over large spatial scales by mapping pan-Canadian drought sensitivity. Overall, we found high coherence in the samples analyzed; low coherence was generally limited to data-poor regions and species. Drought sensitivity was widespread across species and regions: 34% of sampled trees displayed a significant positive relationship between annual growth increment and summer soil moisture index. Dependence upon water availability in species Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP, Pinus banksiana Lamb., Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon, and Pseudotsuga menziesti (Mirb.) Franco was more strongly expressed in the warmest regions of the species' range; for species Picea glottal (Moench) Voss and Populus tremuloides Michx., drought sensitivity was stronger in the driest regions. This unprecedented consolidation and synthesis of tree-ring data will enable new research initiatives (e.g., meta-analyses) aimed at improved understanding of the drivers, patterns, and implications of changes in tree growth, as well as facilitating new research collaborations in earth and environmental sciences. Among other things, there is a need for expanding the spatial distribution of sites across Canada's northern regions, increasing the number of samples collected from older stands and angiosperm species, and integrating datasets from studies that evaluate the effects of silvicultural experiments, including provenance and progeny trials, on tree growth.

AB  - A major challenge remains to understand the relative contributions of history, dispersal, and environmental filtering to the assembly of hyperdiverse communities across spatial scales. Here, we examine the extent to which biogeographical history and habitat specialization have generated turnover among and within lineages of Amazonian trees across broad geographic and environmental gradients. We replicated standardized tree inventories in 102 0.1-ha plots located in two distant regions-the western Amazon and the eastern Guiana shield. Within each region, we used a nested design to replicate plots on contrasted habitats: white-sand, terra firme, and seasonally flooded forests. Our plot network encompassed 26,386 trees that together represented 2,745 distinct taxa, which we standardized across all plots and regions. We combined taxonomic and phylogenetic data with detailed soil measurements and climatic data to: (1) test whether patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic composition are consistent with recent or historical processes, (2) disentangle the relative effects of habitat, environment, and geographic distance on taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover among plots, and (3) contrast the proportion of habitat specialists among species from each region. We found substantial species turnover between Peru and French Guiana, with only 8.8% of species shared across regions; genus composition remained differentiated across habitats and regions, whereas turnover at higher taxonomic levels (family, order) was much lower. Species turnover across plots was explained primarily by regions, but also substantially by habitat differences and to a lesser extent by spatial distance within regions. Conversely, the composition of higher taxonomic levels was better explained by habitats (especially comparing white-sand forests to other habitats) than spatial distance. White-sand forests harbored most of the habitat specialists in both regions, with stronger habitat specialization in Peru than in French Guiana. Our results suggest that recent diversification events have resulted in extremely high turnover in species and genus composition with relatively little change in the composition of higher lineages. Our results also emphasize the contributions of rare habitats, such as white-sand forests, to the extraordinary diversity of the Amazon and underline their importance as conservation priorities.

AB  - Exploring natural regeneration facilitates a better understanding of the mechanisms of community assembly and biodiversity formation. However, convincing data on tree regeneration in threatened tropical plant communities are lacking. Dacrydium pectinatum is a constructive and endangered species in tropical montane forests of Hainan Island. This study aims to identify the seedling regeneration patterns of D. pectinatum formation and their key drivers. A total of 204 seedling plots were investigated in the northwest (Bawangling, 90 plots), southwest (Jianfengling, 90 plots) and southeast (Diaoluoshan, 24 plots) of Hainan Island. We examined the variations in the seedling/adult composition, density and richness along local scales and elevation gradients and analyzed the relationships between biotic/abiotic variables and seedling regeneration. The seedling distribution pattern changed with environmental gradients, and the seedling density and richness decreased from low to high latitudes and from low to high elevations. Additionally, the adult density and total base area also showed consistent trends. At the community and species levels, the biotic neighborhood variables had a primary impact on the seedling density and richness. Multiple environmental factors (such as the canopy density, elevation, slope, soil organic matter, and soil total nitrogen) also showed significant correlations with the seedling density and richness. Our study supports conspecific negative density dependence and niche filtering as the general mechanisms of natural regeneration of D. pectinatum formations. Both biotic and abiotic factors might affect the survival and growth of seedlings, and their relative importance varies with environmental gradients and species. We conclude that enclosing forests with moderate stand densities in low-elevation areas to reduce human interference will help optimize the community structure. However, for high-elevation areas and high-density forests, appropriate thinning, manual regeneration and open gaps are needed to improve the light environment and soil nutrients, thereby promoting the natural regeneration of D. pectinatum formations.

AB  - Plant competition may intensify with climate warming, but whether this will occur equally for conspecific and heterospecific competition remains unknown. Competitive shifts have the potential to instigate community change because the relative strengths of conspecific and heterospecific negative density dependence mediate the stabilizing mechanisms underpinning species coexistence. We examined a mature temperate forest to assess both direct and indirect climate effects at multiple scales: individual species, interspecies relationships, and community stability mechanisms. Our coupled approach (1) quantified tree mortality risk dependence on the interactive effects of competition, climatic water deficit, snowpack, and soil moisture for 28,913 trees over 8 years (3149 mortalities), then (2) used a climate-projection ensemble to forecast changes in conspecific and heterospecific competition from 2020 to 2100. We predict that projected climate warming will destabilize the foundational forest community by increasing the strength of heterospecific competition at a greater rate and to a greater degree than conspecific competition for four of five abundant tree species, particularly on dry microsites. Modeling showed that these findings were most pronounced after the year 2038, at which point snowpacks were projected to be too small to ameliorate the effects of drought on competitive interactions. Our finding that heterospecific competition is more sensitive than conspecific competition to climate warming may indicate the impending loss of ecosystem functioning. We join the growing body of work showing a predominance of indirect drought effects, yet coupled climate models still fail to consider how changing community dynamics may impact forest cover and, in turn, disrupt forest-climate carbon feedbacks. Ecosystems sharing characteristics with our example forest-those with low species richness and therefore a limited biodiversity insurance effect-may be similarly vulnerable to climate-mediated destabilization. In such communities, increased heterospecific competition among even a small number of species can more easily destabilize communities without recourse from redundant species. This study of an overlooked but vital mechanism of community change can be adapted by research in a range of ecosystems to improve the understanding of climate change consequences.

AB  - Understanding the evolution of land use/land cover change (LULCC) and how it shapes current and future ecosystem services (ES) supply potential remains critical in sustainable natural resource management. Community perception of historic LULCC was reconciled with previous study via remote sensing/geographical information systems using recall data in the Budongo-Bugoma landscape in Uganda. Then, a CA-Markovian prediction model of a LULC situation in 2040 under business as usual (BAU) and forest restoration scenarios was constructed. Additionally, we assessed the perceived proximate and underlying drivers of LULCC, and how LULCC shapes ecosystem services potential using household surveys. The perceived LULCC trend for the past three decades (1990-2020) corresponded with previous studies showing grassland, bushland, tropical high forest, and wetland cover declined greatly, while subsistence farmland, commercial farmland, and built-up areas had a great increment. The predicted LULC under (i) the business as usual scenario showed a continued decline of natural LULC while anthropogenic LULC increased greatly, tending to cover half of the landscape area; (ii) forest restoration under different levels showed an improvement of forest cover and other native LULC classes with a decline in mostly subsistence farmland. The proximate drivers were in three principal components (soil infertility, subsistence farming, drought; infrastructural development, commercial farming, overstocking of livestock, pest and disease challenges; tree planting), while underlying drivers were in two principal components (technology adoption, corruption of environment stewards, policy implementation gaps; cultural gaps). Food and cash crops were perceived to be the most important ecosystem services in the landscape. Generally, the landscape ES supply potential was dwindling and predicted to continue with a similar trend under BAU, despite the increment in ES contribution of subsistence and commercial farmland. Forest restoration would slightly improve the landscape ES potential but would cause a decline in subsistence farmland, which would result in either a threat to food/livelihood security or a livelihood shift. We recommend combined interventions that seek to achieve a progressive frontier that achieves development needs and priorities based on national need such as food security through local level production with recognition for sustainable availability of ecosystem services.

AB  - Tropical forests are being destroyed to make space for agricultural activities with the assumption that they are required to feed the growing global population. Consequently, more sustainable practices are needed to guarantee food security and environmental protection of highly threatened natural biodiversity hotspots like the Amazon rainforest. Cattle ranching and soybean cultivation are by far the greater drivers of land use change and deforestation in the Amazon region. We performed a systematic review of papers related to these two main drivers and a meta-analysis on the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. The results of the review highlight a large concern about the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops on the ecosystem dynamics and functionality of the Amazon biome, in addition to the clear relationship with deforestation. Another relevant finding is the large gap in empirical research concerning the effects of sustainable practices on different ecosystem services. Such a gap is evident since only 13 studies from the initial database met the requirements for a meta-analysis. Of the 171 comparisons between the ecosystem services provided in conventional land-uses and those adopting sustainable practices, the overall model indicated a non-significant effect, although the results were heterogeneous. Crop yield and herbage biomass were negatively affected, while livestock productivity, soil organic carbon, soil fertility and woody biomass were positively affected. Also, the six sustainable practices evaluated showed different outcomes, from a predominance of positive effects in silvopastoral systems, to a predominance of negative effects on agrosilvicultural systems. Our systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that cattle ranching and soybean cultivation can indeed be conducted in a more sustainable way, enhancing the provision of ecosystem services while avoiding deforestation. In turn, our results also highlight the lack of empirical data and the need to standardize the methodologies used to deeply assess the effects of such practices. In conclusion, we suggest a way to advance research into the real effects of sustainable practices aimed at reducing the negative impacts of cattle ranching and soybean crops in the Amazon.

Based on relevant knowledge gap, the study area of district Jhelum, Pakistan lying in an arid-tropical zone was selected to explore the vegetation types and their driving environmental factors by using latest multivariate statistical approaches. For this, the entire district was ecologically explored to collect the natural wild vegetation and environmental data from January 2018 to December 2020. The study area was partitioned into 171 grids (5 x 5 km2). In each grid, three sites were randomly selected (i.e. 513 samples), and subsequently-nine plots were laid at each sampling site (i.e. 1539 plots). Different statistical tests including Monte Carlo permutation test, Indicator Species Analysis (ISA), hierarchical classification, ordination, and variation partitioning were applied to seek the potential number of vegetation types, plant species composition, classification of the studied samples, order of importance of the considered predictors and groups of environmental variables respectively. The findings of this study indicated that all the documented 291 plant species belong to five statistically significant (p < 0.05) plant commu-nities. Out of thirty (30) considered environmental variables, canonical correspondence analysis suggested the sig-nificant role of distance from the river, altitude, latitude, slope, temperature, rainfall, distance from the cropland, grazing and deforestation pressure, and soil pollutants including chromium, arsenic and nickel concentrations. Similarly, plant diversity patterns were found strongly associated with the selected local environmental conditions. This study concluded that distance from the river (a potential leading proxy of ground water table depth) is relatively more important than the rainfall variability in this tropical arid area. Hence, the relative proportion of xerophytic plant species was found higher in the western parts compared to eastern parts adjoining the river Jhelum. Anthropogenic disturbances and potentially toxic metals were found disrupting the normal ecosystem functioning at the local scale in this arid tropical region, and need immediate attention to save the valuable local biodiversity.

AB  - Alteration of land-use land cover pattern causes severe consequences on the hydrological system by modifying the rainfall-runoff pattern in a region. The study aimed to investigate the impact of land-use land-cover dynamics on runoff generation in different geomorphic divisions of Panchnoi River basin. The study used the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number method to estimate runoff generation in the Panchnoi River basin in a GIS platform. This study observed that the conversion of the land-use pattern in the geomorphic zones significantly enhances runoff. The Piedmont experience highest land-use change, where 64.17 km2 forest cover lost to cropland and built-up lands, leads to a notable increase in runoff generation, i.e. from 1 076 mm (52.82% of rainfall) in 1990 to 1 467 mm (70.46% of rainfall) in 2015. The Flood plain and New alluvial plain generates high runoff in the basin as it mostly occupied by human-induced land-uses, i.e. 1 444 mm (72.72% of rainfall) and 1 360 mm (71.70% of rainfall) respectively in 1990, which increase to 1588 mm (79.20%) and 1507 mm (78.69%) runoff respectively in 2015, due to alteration of cropland to built-up lands. In the Old alluvial plain, a marginal land-use change observed resulted in moderate growth in runoff from 1 272 mm (62.35%) to 1 404 mm (66.79%). The study indicates land-use land-cover change invokes to increase runoff generation can give rise severe environmental and economic problems in the river basin, through the occurrence of flashflood and soil erosion.
   Highlights for public administration, management and planning:
   center dot Evaluation of the impact of land-use land cover dynamics on runoff is essential for containing flash flood and water resource management on a basin scale.
   center dot Alteration of natural land covers has severe implications in the form of flood, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity.
   center dot Enhanced runoff due to land-use dynamics reduces groundwater recharge rate that may cause drinking water scarcity in the dry season shortly.

AB  - In the context of climate change and biodiversity loss, rehabilitation of degraded urban soils is a means of limiting artificialization of terrestrial ecosystems and preventing further degradation of soils. Ecological rehabilitation approaches are available to reinitiate soil functions and enhance plant development. However, little is known about the long-term stability of rehabilitated soils in terms of soil functions when further natural or anthropogenic perturbations occur. Based on rehabilitated urban soils, the present study sought to evaluate the resistance and resilience of soil functions linked to carbon cycling and phosphate dynamics in addition to nitrogen cycling and related microbial communities after a heat and drought stress. A laboratory experiment was conducted in microcosms under controlled temperature conditions, with four contrasted soils collected from a rehabilitated urban brownfield; an initial, non-rehabilitated soil (IS), a technosol with a high organic matter level (HO), and two technosols with less organic matter (LO1 and LO2), together with their respective controls (no stress). Changes in potential denitrification (PDR), nitrification (PNR) rates, and their interactive relationships with soil microbial activities and soil physicochemical properties were determined following a combined heat (40 degrees C) and drought stress period of 21 days. Measurements were carried out immediately after the stress (resistance), and then also 5, 30, and 92 days after soil rewetting at 60% water holding capacity (resilience). Microbial activities involved in soil functions such as carbon cycling and phosphate dynamics proved to be of low resistance in all soils except for IS; however, they were resilient and recovered rapidly after rewetting. On the other hand, the microbial activities and gene abundances that were measured in relation to nitrogen cycling processes showed that for denitrification, activities were more rapidly resilient than gene abundances whereas for nitrification the activities and gene abundances were resilient in the same way. Results suggest that, unless the soils contain high amounts of organic matter, microbial communities in imported soils can be more vulnerable to environmental pressures such as drought and heat than communities already present. This should be considered when rehabilitating degraded soils.

AB  - The severe deforestation of Brazil's Atlantic Forest and the increasing effects of climate change underscore the need to understand how tree species respond to climate and edaphic factors. To identify the most important environmental drivers of coastal Atlantic Forest diversity and functional composition, we studied 42 plots of coastal Atlantic Forest (restinga), which has a high diversity of plant communities and spans strong environmental gradients. We examined how forest physiognomy and functional composition respond to changes in the environment, hydraulic, and soil properties. We tested different hypotheses relating the roles of nutrients and soil water availability in driving shifts in tropical forest diversity and functioning. We collected wood samples and leaves from similar to 85% of the plant species identified in the forest inventory and estimated the community-weighted tree height, aboveground biomass, basal area of individual plants, specific leaf area, wood density, and the total tree biomass per community by the sum of all trees' aboveground biomass per plot. We measured water table depth and 24 physicochemical soil parameters. Hypotheses relating to these factors were formalized via both generalized additive models and piecewise structural equation models and null models of community assembly. Increasing drought, as reflected by increasing water table depth, coarse sand, and soil concentration of aluminum (>6 cmol/kg), was found to be a primary driver of shifts in all measured functional traits. Water table depth was found to be the main environmental driver of restinga species diversity, but shifts in species richness were largely decoupled from functional richness and functional dispersion. Our results suggest that decreases in soil water availability are a central driver of local phenotype-environment matching and that increasing water limitation increases the role of environmental filtering on multiple traits. Our results show that drought leads to a strong convergence (standardized effect size < -1.95) in forest function and leads to shifts to smaller statured forest in particular. These findings reveal important differences in the drivers of forest structure and functioning, suggesting that changes in local spatial variation in soil and moisture variables will be a central issue in restinga management and conservation.

AB  - Bwindi Impenetrable National Park situated southwest of Uganda is a biodiversity hotspot that is home to about half of theworld's endangered mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei). Given its ecological significance andmounting pressures fromagricultural activities such as tea growing, continuous monitoring of the levels of chemical toxins like pesticides in the park and surrounding areas is needed for effective conservation strategies. Furthermore, persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) like DDT were used in agricultural gardens and indoor spraying in Kanungu district between the 1950s and 80s. The focus of this study was to explore the possible exposure of mountain gorillas to OCPs and cypermethrin used by the farmers in the areas near the park. Data fromour interviews revealed that glyphosate is the most widely used pesticide by the farmers in areas surrounding the park, followed by cypermethrin, and mancozeb. Samples of leaves from plants consumed by mountain gorillas along the forest edges of the park and surficial soils (15-20 cm depths) were collected from three sites (Ruhija, Nkuringo and Buhoma) and analysed for the presence of cypermethrin and OCPs residues. Concentrations of total (Sigma) DDTs and Sigma endosulfans were up to 0.34 and 9.89 mg/kg dry weight (d.w), respectively in soil samples. Concentrations of Sigma DDTs and Sigma endosulfans in samples of leaves ranged from 0.67 to 1.38 mg/kg d.w (mean= 1.07 mg/kg d.w) and 0.9 to 2.71 mg/kg d.w (mean= 1.68 mg/kg d.w), respectively. Mean concentration of Sigma DDTs in leaves exceeded the European pharmacopeia and United States pharmacopeia recommended maximum residue limit values for DDTs inmedicinal plants (1.0 mg/kg). In addition, calculated hazard indices for silverbacks (36.35), females (57.54) and juveniles (77.04) suggested potential health risks to the mountain gorillas. o,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDT ratios (0.5-0.63) in samples of leaves confirmed recent input of dicofol-DDT type in Bwindi rainforest.

AB  - 1. The stewardship of forests across multiple human generations has potential to lead to cultural innovations fostering sustainable uses. Nevertheless, positive culture-nature interactions are often disrupted due to colonial exploitation and a lack of intrinsic value ascribed to nature in capitalist economies. There is global recognition that restoring degraded ecosystems is critical to promote the welfare of people and nature by reducing the negative impacts of global climate change and diminishing biodiversity. However, with a focus on technical remedies, restoration and reforestation efforts generally fail to address the root causes of ecosystem degradation.
   2. In this perspective paper, we call for explicit incorporation of cultural values into global reforestation efforts. We focus on music as a cultural ecosystem service as music has been a prominent part of human history with clear sociological and psychological attributes that may invite mass interest and participation. We illustrate the value of musical linkages via three case studies from Europe, Africa and Hawaii focusing on native tree species, their wood, musical ecology and their interaction with culture.
   3. We show that multi-generational stewardship of native ecosystems in Europe has allowed the refinement of the violin to its current form, one that is culturally significant for millions of people and has created a multi-million dollar industry. This development stems from a 500-year tradition of craftsmanship handed down across generations and illustrates that ecocultural interactions can be a strong dynamo for development of unique commodities.
   4. In contrast, in regions where extirpation of native plant species was used as a deliberate colonization strategy, many ecocultural linkages face risk of extinction. Our case studies from Africa and Hawaii illustrate how native tree species of particular value for musical expression were nearly lost and along with loss of music, important cultural connections to nature.
   5. In the context of restoration, there is also evidence that music-based linkages can revitalize nature-culture interactions and promote restoration of native ecosystems. Incorporating native trees in global reforestation efforts is critical for ensuring that reforestation efforts capture the synergies needed for developing new ideologies that promote the well-being of co-dependent humans and all life.

AB  - Remote sensing of disturbance in the savannas from Brazil is challenging, especially due to confounding effects of the vegetation phenology and natural soil exposure on the detection of clearing and fire events. In this study, we investigated the detection of disturbance over this global hotspot of biodiversity using seven vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from the Landsat time series (2017-2019) and the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. The selected VIs represented distinct biophysical characteristics of the savannas. We evaluated the effects of disturbance on these VIs and assessed the accuracy of CCDC-detection in 2019, considering individual VIs, ensemble VIs, and the type of disturbance (savanna clearing and fire). Finally, we analyzed the possible existence of seasonal patterns of disturbance in a study area located at the new agricultural frontier of the Cerrado biome. The results showed that the overall accuracy of CCDC detection of total disturbance ranged from 51.2% for the Green-Red Normalized Difference (GRND) to 65.9% for the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR2). It increased to 71.2% for ensemble VIs, whose multivariate approach reduced the omission errors in the analysis when compared to the use of single VIs. For detecting events of savanna clearing and fire, the most important VIs used near-infrared and shortwave infrared reflectance bands on their formulations (NBR2, NBR, and Moisture Stress Index-MSI). The CCDC accuracy was generally higher for detecting clearing than for mapping burned areas. In contrast, the recorded date of disturbance occurrence was less precise for detecting clearing than for recording events caused by fire, especially due to the existence of some gradual processes of vegetation degradation until complete clearing. Our findings showed also the existence of a seasonal pattern of disturbance occurrence. Savanna clearing predominated in the transition from the rainy to the dry season (April to July) to open new areas for agriculture. It preceded most events of fire disturbance between August and October that occurred near the consolidated areas of agriculture and extended into the native vegetation areas. Results reinforce the importance of data-driven approaches for generating early warning alerts of disturbance in the Cerrado to be further checked in the field.

AB  - One consequence of global change causing widespread concern is the possibility of ecosystem conversions from one type to another. A classic example of this is vegetation type conversion (VTC) from native woody shrublands to invasive annual grasslands in the biodiversity hotspot of Southern California. Although the significance of this problem is well recognized, understanding where, how much, and why this change is occurring remains elusive owing to differences in results from studies conducted using different methods, spatial extents, and scales. Disagreement has arisen particularly over the relative importance of short-interval fires in driving these changes. Chronosequence approaches that use space for time to estimate changes have produced different results than studies of changes at a site over time. Here we calculated the percentage woody and herbaceous cover across Southern California using air photos from similar to 1950 to 2019. We assessed the extent of woody cover change and the relative importance of fire history, topography, soil moisture, and distance to human infrastructure in explaining change across a hierarchy of spatial extents and regions. We found substantial net decline in woody cover and expansion of herbaceous vegetation across all regions, but the most dramatic changes occurred in the northern interior and southern coastal areas. Variables related to frequent, short-interval fire were consistently top ranked as the explanation for shrub to grassland type conversion, but low soil moisture and topographic complexity were also strong correlates. Despite the consistent importance of fire, there was substantial geographical variation in the relative importance of drivers, and these differences resulted in different mapped predictions of VTC. This geographical variation is important to recognize for management decision-making and, in addition to differences in methodological design, may also partly explain differences in previous study results. The overwhelming importance of short-interval fire has management implications. It suggests that actions should be directed away from imposing fires to preventing fires. Prevention can be controlled through management actions that limit ignitions, fire spread, and the damage sustained in areas that do burn. This study also demonstrates significant potential for changing fire regimes to drive large-scale, abrupt ecological change.

AB  - Karst made up of limestone is widely considered a "Noah's ark" of biodiversity. Rock and soil substrates comprise two different site types in karst terrain, although both can support dense forests. However, it is unclear whether and how the presence of exposed rock affects forest diversity and tree size. We established a 2.2 ha plot (200 x 110 m) in an old-growth oak forest (> 300 years) in karst terrain in southwestern China. We classified the plot into rock and soil components; we analyzed plant diversity and tree size in each component using species diversity indices (richness, number of individuals, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index), stand spatial structure parameters, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (TH), and tree basal area (BA). We also analyzed the distributional patterns of species at the sites using non-metric multidimensional scaling, then assessed the effects of abiotic environmental variables on diversity and tree size using redundancy analysis. Our results indicated that both site types (i.e., rock and soil) had similar overall species diversity; trees and shrubs were largely distributed at random within the study site. Tree size was evenly differentiated in the community, and trees were dominant, particularly on soil. Trees on rock were in a status of medium mixture, whereas shrubs on rock were highly mixed. The opposite trend was observed for trees and shrubs growing on soil. The DBH, TH, and BA were smaller in trees growing on rock than in trees growing on soil. Abiotic environmental variables had varying effects on the diversity and size of trees at the two site types; they only explained 21.76 and 14.30% of total variation, respectively. These results suggest that exposed rock has the effect of reducing tree size, but not diversity, thus highlighting the important role of rock in maintaining diversity; moreover, the results imply that karst microhabitats may mitigate the impacts of topography on tree diversity and growth. Greater attention should be focused on exposed rock in the conservation and management of karst forests and the restoration of degraded forest ecosystems.

AB  - This study reviews the global increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), alongside the accelerated climatic change and its slow onset effects (or events) between 1992 and 2021. The establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, and the simultaneous UN Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, generated the international efforts to tackle climatic change. Over the years, the UNFCCC-Conference of the Parties (COP) has led the efforts in climate change mitigation and adaptation, with many sequential meetings across the world. Three decades later, at the COP26 meeting in Glasgow in 2021, it is evident that climate change impacts have substantially worsened. Despite some uncertainties, it seems that over the last three decades, the climate change slow onset events, including 1) increasing temperatures, 2) glacial retreat, 3) sea level rise, 4) ocean acidification, 5) soil salinization, 6) land and forest degradation, 7) loss of biodiversity, and 8) desertification, have substantially exacerbated. Simultaneously, other (non-GHGs related) anthropogenic impacts, including habitat fragmentation, land-use and sea-use change and misuse, species overexploitation, environmental pollution, infrastructure constructions, and urbanization, have considerably increased. With the aim of achieving the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways 1.9 (SSP1-1.9) or SSP1-2.6 ultimate goals-keeping global warming in 2,100 below 1.5? or 2.0?, respectively, compared to preindustrial levels-it may still be possible to avoid climate change's irreversible tipping points. To reach this target, policymaking must become more decisive and proactive, with continuous risks assessment, frequent monitoring of outcomes and their compatibility to goals, implementing practical legislation tools, and assigning specific financial instruments, aimed at effectively tackling climate change slow onset events and related environmental issues. Substantial efforts should be invested in boosting climate change mitigation, while simultaneously targeting effective climatic change adaptation measures and promoting environmental conservation and restoration. Relying on tools such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will sustain provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services, thus improving water(-), food(-), environmental(-), energy(-), economic(-), health(-), and governance-security, while lessening the risks of social unrest, violent conflicts, mass migration, and other humanitarian catastrophes.

AB  - The role of intraspecific trait variation in functional ecology has gained traction in recent years as many papers have observed its importance in driving community diversity and ecology. Yet much of the work in this field relies on field-based trait surveys. Here, we used continuous canopy trait information derived from remote sensing data of a highly polymorphic tree species, Metrosideros polymorpha, to quantify environmental controls on intraspecific trait variation. M. polymorpha, an endemic, keystone tree species in Hawai'i, varies morphologically, chemically, and genetically across broad elevation and soil substrate age gradients, making it an ideal model organism to explore large-scale environmental drivers of intraspecific trait variation. M. polymorpha canopy reflectance (visible to shortwave infrared; 380-2510 nm) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data collected by the Global Airborne Observatory were modeled to canopy trait estimates of leaf mass per area, chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, total carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, phenols, cellulose, and top of canopy height using previously developed leaf chemometric equations. We explored how these derived traits varied across environmental gradients by extracting elevation, slope, aspect, precipitation, and soil substrate age data at canopy locations. We then obtained the feature importance values of the environmental factors in predicting each leaf trait by training random forest models to predict leaf traits individually. Of these environmental factors, elevation was the most important predictor for all canopy traits. Elevation not only affected canopy traits directly but also indirectly by influencing the relationships between soil substrate age and canopy traits as well as between nitrogen and other traits, as indicated by the change in slope between the variables at different elevation ranges. In conclusion, intraspecific variation in M. polymorpha traits derived from remote sensing adheres to known leaf economic spectrum (LES) patterns as well as interspecific LES traits previously mapped using imaging spectroscopy.

AB  - The carbon sequestration efficiency of manure (CSE-manure) is critical for the accurate estimation of manuring-induced changes in soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the mechanisms of large-scale spatiotemporal changes in CSE-manure and their crucial drivers are unclear. To investigate these under various manure regimes, we performed field observation and collected relevant data using 1023 fields across China's main cropland, as well as collected data on high-resolution climate and soil properties. The experimental durations significantly (P < 0.001) affected CSE-manure. The CSE-manure values were 31.4% +/- 13.4 (mean +/- SD), 19.2% +/- 10.3%, and 16.1% +/- 9.4 at the experimental durations of < 10, 10-20, and > 20 years, respectively. In addition, the manure sources significantly affected CSE-manure. The CSE-manure values of the manures from horse (27.9% +/- 19.0) and sheep (26.9% +/- 11.0) and farmyard manure (25.7% +/- 14.8) were higher than those of the manures from pig (19.8% +/- 15.4), poultry (19.1% +/- 10.58), and cattle (23.1% +/- 13.1). The CSE-manure values varied as per the region; the values were higher in North China than in South China. Of all the investigated variables, carbon and nitrogen input from manure, soil bulk density, annual average air temperature and precipitation, and initial SOC and soil clay content were the most important drivers of CSE-manure. The results suggested that carbon sequestration potential was higher in the northeast region. The spatiotemporal CSE-manure values under various climate conditions were predicted using trained machine learning models. Simulation results suggested that by 2100, the rate of decrease in CSE-manure will be higher at RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) 8.5, and climate change will have a great impact on CSE-manure due to high warming effects.

AB  - The 2021 emergence of the 17-year Brood X cicadas (Magicicada septendecim, M. cassinii, and M. septendecula) saw billions of cicadas emerge from the soil throughout the midwestern and eastern United States. The emergence left connected burrows visible at the surface, which are hypothesized to affect near surface hydrologic processes. To investigate these processes, we used single-ring, dual head infiltrometers to measure field saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs, n = 70) across patterns of emergence and land use in south-central Indiana, USA. Our experimental design included locations with and without cicada burrows in forested (undisturbed) and urbanized (disturbed) areas. Across undisturbed sites, we found a significant 80.8% increase in K-fs between soils with (median = 14.1 cm/h; n = 20) and without (median = 7.8 cm/h; n = 20) cicada burrows. At disturbed sites, we found no significant difference in K-fs between sites with (median = 4.2 cm/h; n = 18) and without (median = 4.4 cm/h; n = 12) cicada burrows. We found a significant correlation between the number of burrows present at the surface and K-fs rates for undisturbed sites (rho$$ \rho $$ = 0.42; p = 0.008), while no correlation was found for the disturbed sites (rho$$ \rho $$ = -0.09; p = 0.62). Our measurements suggest that the effect of burrows on K-fs is minimized in urbanized areas, potentially due to compaction and other impacts from human disturbance that mitigate the presence of macropores left by cicadas. In contrast, surface-connected macroporosity from Brood X cicada burrows in undisturbed areas act as a conduit for precipitation into the soil profile and bypass flow into deeper horizons and the shallow groundwater table, with implications for runoff dynamics, soil and groundwater recharge and quality, and nutrient cycling.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity, which is one of the basic characteristics of ecological and geographical elements, is substantial in mountainous areas. Research on ecosystem services (ESs) increasingly considers spatial heterogeneity in environmental management-related decision-making. This study quantified the dominant ESs and ES trade-offs for the Hengduan Mountain region in Southwest China. The spatial heterogeneity was analyzed by introducing gradients of elevation, vegetation cover, and land cover. The results showed that, in addition to inverse changes in ESs, ES change rates were important for ES trade-offs. Further, land cover was identified as the main factor influencing the spatial heterogeneity of the majority of ES trade-offs. Specifically, the net primary productivity (NPP), carbon storage (C), and habitat quality (HQ) all showed inverted U-shaped trends along the elevation gradient and HQ increased thereafter, water yield (WY) presented an overall decline but increased in high-altitude areas, and soil conservation (SC) exhibited a fluctuating trend. The change rate of SC was slower than that of NPP, C, and HQ, which led to changes in the trade-offs between SC and other ESs along the elevation gradient. The higher WY in built-up land and higher HQ in forests were the main reasons for higher trade-offs. The low trade-off for unused land was attributed to the limited levels of several ESs. Along the vegetation gradient, WY first decreased then increased, whereas all other services showed increasing trends. The limited promotion effect of vegetation on SC was the primary reason for increased trade-offs. Therefore, more attention should be devoted to improving SC via engineering measures. Furthermore, vegetation degradation on unused land should be prevented to maintain SC and reduce the trade-offs among ESs.

AB  - Despite the important roles of microorganisms in soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition and nutrient cycling, how their biomass, community composition and function are driven by a joint effect of edaphic and environmental factors at a large spatial scale remains unclear. Moreover, a mechanistic understanding of the associations among microbial communities and SOM chemistry as a key indicator of substrate availability over large spatial scales has been lacking until now. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined how soil microbial community abundance and composition (via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis) and function (via enzyme activities and net N mineralization) were associated with the edaphic and environmental factors from six oriental oak (Quercus variabilis) forest sites arranged across a 11 degrees latitudinal gradient in East China. We found strong relationships between SOM chemistry as indicated by C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and microbial community composition and function along this gradient. For example, the ratio of fungi to bacteria (F/B) decreased with increasing carboxyl C percentage; the lower abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and decreased invertase activity in the southern sites were possibly related to higher ratio of alkyl to O alkyl (A/O); urease activity increased with carboxyl C percentage. Microbial biomass (total PLFAs) had positive relationships with urease activity, net N mineralization rate, and soil pH. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and pH were important for overall microbial community composition. Overall, our results indicate that SOM chemistry is closely related to microbial community composition and function along the latitudinal gradient and should be considered in future studies. Our study contributes to a better prediction of microbial responses to possible substrate changes brought by future environmental changes, which is urgently needed under the context of accelerating global change.

AB  - Phenological studies are fundamental for understanding the structure and dynamics of the plant community and assist in understanding the influence of climate on vegetation and for the analysis of plant-animal interactions. In this work, we present the phenology of 19 woody species of coastal dunes located in the eastern end of the Amazon coast. We evaluate the phenological aspects of the community and their relationship with climatic factors (photoperiod, precipitation, and temperature). For this evaluation, 19 woody species with a diameter at soil height (DBH) > 3 cm and whole crown visible were selected. Information on leaf abscission, new leaves, flowering, and fruiting was collected fortnightly. The activity and intensity of each phenophase were estimated according to the Fournier index. Circular statistic was employed to determine the mean dates for the start and peak of the phenophases, and the percentage of activity and intensity for each phenophase. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to investigate the relationships between phenophases and climatic variables. Additionally, leaf habits and pollination and dispersion syndromes were defined for each species. The results reveal that the species evaluated did not show seasonally defined behavior, nor were they related to the climatic factors evaluated. Most species showed evergreen leaf habit (83.4%), melittophilly as the primary pollination syndrome (78.9%), and zoochoric dispersal (84.22%). Although it does not present a seasonally defined behavior, nor is it related to the climatic factors evaluated, the dry season presented the highest percentages for all phenophases, which may indicate that other factors associated with the dry period may influence the trigger off the phenophases. The information collected expands the knowledge about the functioning of this ecosystem and reinforces the need for more ecological studies and reduced impact management measures, aiming at coastal vegetation conservation.

AB  - Revealing the mechanisms of environmental niche partitioning within lowland tropical forests is important for understanding the drivers of current species distributions and potential vulnerability to environmental change. Tropical forest structure and species composition change across edaphic gradients in Borneo over short distances. However, our understanding of how edaphic conditions affect tree physiology and whether these relationships drive niche partitioning within Bornean forests remains incomplete. This study evaluated how leaf physiological function changes with nutrient availability across a fine-scale edaphic gradient and whether these relationships vary according to tree height. Furthermore, we tested whether intraspecific leaf trait variation allows generalist species to populate a wider range of environments. We measured leaf traits of 218 trees ranging in height from 4 to 66 m from 13 dipterocarp species within four tropical forest types (alluvial, mudstone, sandstone and kerangas) occurring along an <5 km edaphic gradient in North Borneo. The traits measured included saturating photosynthesis (A(sat)), maximum photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax), leaf dark respiration (R-leaf), leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf thickness, minimum stomatal conductance (g(dark)) and leaf nutrient concentrations (N, P, Ca, K and Mg). Across all species, leaf traits varied consistently in response to soil nutrient availability across forest types except R-leaf_mass, [Mg](leaf) and [Ca](leaf). Changes in photosynthesis and respiration rates were related to different leaf nutrients across forest types, with greater nutrient-use efficiency in more nutrient-poor environments. Generalist species partially or fully compensated reductions in mass-based photosynthesis through increasing LMA in more nutrient-poor environments. Leaf traits also varied with tree height, except V-cmax_mass, but only in response to height-related modifications of leaf morphology (LMA and leaf thickness). These height-trait relationships did not vary across the edaphic gradient, except for A(sat), [N](leaf), [P](leaf) and [K](leaf). Our results highlight that modification of leaf physiological function and morphology act as important adaptations for Bornean dipterocarps in response to edaphic and vertical environmental gradients. Meanwhile, multiple nutrients appear to contribute to niche partitioning and could drive species distributions and high biodiversity within Bornean forest landscapes.

AB  - The Saranda forest region, which is well known for its biodiversity in India, is now confronted by rapid socioeconomic development, particularly the hilltop mining activities. Hilltop mining areas of this region have always been responsible for producing excessive soil erosion in the associated river basin. This erosion phenomenon becomes hazardous during the rainy season, thereby contributing to various environmental problems, and consequently, necessitating soil erosion control planning in the Saranda forest. Hence, this study aimed to estimate average annual soil erosion in the Saranda region in terms of the spatial distribution using the Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The erosion was quantified at a spatial resolution of 10 m (pixel by pixel) using the GIS-based RUSLE inputs. This study also applies GIS integrated Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model to identify the favorable zones for sediment deposition in the study area. On the basis of erosion severity, the entire study area is classified into six categories (very low to extreme). The study reveals that the Saranda forest's average annual soil erosion is 76 tons per hectare per year (t/ha/yr). Approximately 63% of the total area is categorized under very low to low erosion category, and the relevant area is mainly covered by forest land, whereas the mining region comprises less than 1% of the total study area with extremely high soil erosion (156 t/ha/yr) potential. As envisaged from the present study, the erosion-prone mining areas are located within a 1-5 km range of the adjacent Karo and Koina rivers, thereby, necessitating the erosion control strategy to avoid the possible threats. From this perspective, the study also investigates the favorable zones for sediment deposition using the GIS integrated AHP model to suggest the appropriate erosion control measures. Finally, the RUSLE and AHP models are combined on the GIS platform to identify the distressed catchment area. Moreover, 42% (41,060 ha) of the total area is disturbed due to the present mining activities, which involves 11 sub-watersheds, and their associated 50 micro-watersheds. From the context of watershed conservation, erosion control measures are also recommended. The methodology adopted in this study can be easily extended to any global mining-dominated catchment for sustainable conservation planning.

AB  - Forest fires, though part of a natural forest renewal process, when frequent and on a large -scale, have detrimental impacts on biodiversity, agroforestry systems, soil erosion, air, and water quality, infrastructures, and the economy. Portugal endures extreme forest fires, with a record extent of burned areas in 2017. These complexes of extreme wildfire events (CEWEs) concentrated in a few days but with highly burned areas are, among other factors, linked to severe fire weather conditions. In this study, a comparison between several fire danger indices (named 'multi-indices diagnosis') is performed for the control period 2001-2021, 2007 and 2017 (May-October) for the Fire Weather Index (FWI), Burning Index (BI), Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI), Continuous Haines Index (CHI), and the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI). Daily analysis for the so-called Pedrogao Grande wildfire (17 June) and the October major fires (15 October) included the Spread Component (SC), Ignition Component (IC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), Buildup Index (BUI), and the Energy Release Component (ERC). Results revealed statistically significant high above-average values for most of the indices for 2017 in comparison with 2001-2021, particularly for October. The spatial distribution of BI, IC, ERC, and SC had the best performance in capturing the locations of the two CEWEs that were driven by atmospheric instability along with a dry environment aloft. These results were confirmed by the hotspot analysis that showed statistically significant intense spatial clustering between these indices and the burned areas. The spatial patterns for SC and ISI showed high values associated with high velocities in the spread of these fires. The outcomes allowed us to conclude that since fire danger depends on several factors, a multi-indices diagnosis can be highly relevant. The implementation of a Multi-index Prediction Methodology should be able to further enhance the ability to track and forecast unique CEWEs since the shortcomings of some indices are compensated by the information retrieved by others, as shown in this study. Overall, a new forecast method can help ensure the development of appropriate spatial preparedness plans, proactive responses by civil protection regarding firefighter management, and suppression efforts to minimize the detrimental impacts of wildfires in Portugal.

AB  - Forest fires have become a growing concern worldwide, with climate change exacerbating their frequency and intensity. In the Simlipal region of India, forest fires are relatively rare; however, in 2021, significant damage occurred in the buffer area's forests. Understanding the driving factors behind these events is essential for developing effective management strategies. This study investigates the impact of hydro-meteorological conditions on forest fire causes in the Simlipal region by analyzing Terra climatic data and geo-statistics for the period of 1984 to 2021. Long-term trends were determined using non-parametric tests on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Our findings reveal that the maximum burned area location has a decreasing trend in Land Surface Temperature (LST), with a small portion (<10%) showing an increasing trend (0.02 degrees C/year) near burned locations. Wind speed is decreasing at a rate of -0.006 m/s/year. The sudden forest fires are caused by the combined effect of increasing LST and decreasing wind speed in some areas (<10% of the region). However, the major factor contributing to forest fires in the entire area is the rising trend of annual potential water deficit and actual evapotranspiration, as well as an increasing trend of minimum temperature. The soil moisture deficit during the summer season, especially between 2012 and 2021, contributed to forest fires in the burned area. The soil moisture deficit during the summer season, particularly from 2012 to 2021, played a significant role in the occurrence of forest fires in the affected area. The study emphasized the need for increased attention to this region in order to preserve biodiversity, which was assessed through an analysis of burned severity mapping in GEE (Google Earth Engine). These findings have important implications for future forest management strategies in the Simlipal region. Climate variability is likely to exacerbate the frequency and intensity of forest fires in the region, necessitating effective management strategies to mitigate their impact. Such strategies could involve improving fire prevention and control measures, such as creating fire breaks and increasing the availability of fire-fighting equipment, as well as enhancing forest monitoring systems to detect potential fires early. Additionally, efforts to address climate change, proper management of land use practices, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions could help to mitigate the future impacts of forest fires in the Simlipal region and elsewhere.

AB  - 1.Many studies of community assembly focus on a single ontogenetic stage (typically adults) when trying to infer assembly processes from patterns of biodiversity. This focus ignores the finding that assembly mechanisms may strongly differ between life--stages, and the role of ontogenetic dependency: the mechanisms by which one life stage directly affects the composition of another life stage.
   2. Within a 4--ha forest dynamics plot in California USA, we explored how the relative importance of multiple assembly processes shifts across life stages and assessed ontogenetic dependency of seedlings on adults in woody plant communities. To assess variation in assembly processes across life stages, we examined how ss--diversity of adult and seedling communities were each influenced by space and 13 environmental variables (soils, topography) using distance--based redundancy analysis and variation partitioning. We then assessed the ontogenetic dependency of seedlings on adults by including adult composition as a predictor in the seedling community variation partitioning.
   3. We found differences between adult and seedling composition. For the adults, we found 18 species including pines, oaks and manzanitas characteristic of this mid--elevation forest. For seedlings, we found 11 species, and that oaks made up 75% of all seedlings while only making up 45% of all adults. Adult ss--diversity was primarily explained by space (44.0%) with environment only explaining 18.6% and 37.4% unexplained. In contrast, most of the explained variation in seedling ss--diversity was due to ontogenetic dependency alone (13.6% explained by adult composition) with 1.6% explained by space and the environment jointly, and 62.8% unexplained.
   4. Synthesis: Here, we describe a conceptual framework for integrating ontogeny more explicitly into community assembly research and demonstrate how different assembly processes structured adult and seedling ss--diversity in a temperate dry forest. While adult ss- -diversity was largely driven by spatial processes, seedling ss--diversity was largely unexplained, with ontogenetic dependency comprising most of the explained variation. These patterns suggest that future assemblyresearch should consider how assembly processes and their underlying mechanisms may shift with ontogeny, and that interactions between ontogenetic stages (ontogenetic dependency) are critical to consider when assessing variation in -assembly processes.

AB  - Background Large old trees are keystone structures of terrestrial ecosystems that provide unique habitat resources for wildlife. Their widespread decline worldwide has serious implications for biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. In arid regions, large trees are relatively uncommon and often restricted to areas with elevated soil moisture and nutrients. Introduced grasses, now pervasive in many dryland environments, also thrive in such areas and are promoting more frequent and intense fire, potentially threatening the persistence of large trees. Here we report on the impact of a single wildfire on large river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh.) in arid riparian woodland invaded by buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.), a serious invader of desert ecosystems worldwide. In 2018, 266 trees with > 80 cm equivalent trunk diameter were mapped at six sites to provide a 'pre-fire' baseline. Within a year, the sites were impacted by a large, unprecedented wildfire that burnt an area of 660 km(2) ha in 15 days. Sites were resurveyed in February 2019 to assess the fate of the trees. Reference to fire severity, calculated from remote-sensed imagery, is provided for additional context. Results In total, 67 trees, 27% of all large trees at the sites were destroyed. If trees in unburnt patches are excluded, 54% of trees exposed to the fire were destroyed and the remainder lost on average 79% of their canopy. Conclusions This severe detrimental effect of a single fire, on trees estimated to be centuries old, is indicative of tree-loss occurring across remote arid Australia in habitats where fire is now fuelled predominantly by invasive grasses. Large volumes of novel grass fuels along creeklines in combination with extreme weather events were major factors driving the spread, extent and impacts of the wildfire we report on and are causing a shift from relatively uncommon and predictable, rainfall-dependent large wildfires to large, severe fires that can occur anytime. We predict further decline in the abundance of large trees from similar fires will occur widely throughout arid Australia over the next decade with substantial long-term impacts on multiple species. New strategies are urgently required to manage fire in invaded arid ecosystems to better protect large trees and the critical resources they provide.

AB  - The soil seed bank (SSB) plays an important role in determining future community composition and health of forests. The extent to which abiotic conditions alter the abundance and diversity of the future forest composition via modulating the regenerative capacity of the SSB and their relationship with each other is not fully understood. We studied how elevation and abiotic conditions (canopy openness, slope, aspect, soil pH, and a natural gradient of these soil nutrients: total nitrogen [N], total carbon [C], C:N ratio, available phosphorus [P], available potassium [K], calcium [Ca], iron [Fe], magnesium [Mg], manganese [Mn], and sulfur [S]) affect community characteristics, calculated as: (1) seedling abundance, (2) species richness, (3) Shannon-Weiner diversity index, (4) Simpson index, (5) Chao 2 richness estimator, (6) number of species represented by only one individual, and (7) number of species that occur only in one plot. We used soils sampled in 13 1-ha plots along an altitudinal gradient from 400 to 1850 m above sea level. We determined both direct and indirect causal relationships between abiotic factors and SSB community characteristics using linear mixed models and structural equation modeling. Increased elevation and canopy openness resulted in lower species richness and diversity as well as fewer rare species. However, greater canopy openness resulted in higher abundance. Abundance and richness of the SSB were lower in steeper slopes, but this negative effect appeared to be along an indirect pathway through soil pH and nutrients such as soil Mn and S. Soil P had a significant negative relationship with SSB characteristics for all indices evaluated here, except for SSB abundance, which was positively affected by increased soil pH. Our results highlight the role of abiotic factors in forest regeneration and resilience through their influence on the soil seed bank community. This study is one of the very first to provide data on the SSB along a wide elevational range in subtropical forests, and can be the basis to assess the regeneration potential and health of the study region.

AB  - Hainan Island is one of China's most ecologically diverse areas. Human activities and climate change have recently influenced Hainan Island's ecosystem services. Therefore, scientific methods are urgently needed to investigate the characteristics of these services' spatial and temporal variations and their driving mechanisms for maintaining Hainan Island's biodiversity and high-quality ecological conservation. Based on multivariate remote sensing and reanalysis data, this study analysed the spatial and temporal variations in water retention, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and oxygen release services on Hainan Island during 1980-2015 using various ecosystem service models such as INVEST, CASA and RULSE. Then, we analysed different ecosystem service drivers using a random forest model. The results indicated that (1) from 1980 to 2015, the change characteristics of different ecosystem types (arable, forest, and grassland) decreased, and the proportion of decrease was 0.98%, 0.55% and 0.36%, respectively. Built-up and water increased significantly, and the proportion of increase reached 1.46% and 0.51%, respectively. (2) Hainan Island's functions of water retention, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, and oxygen release services decreased from 23.31 billion m3, 2.89 billion t, 9.68 million t and 56.05 million t in 1980 to 23.15 billion m3, 2.79 billion t, 9.42 million t and 55.53 million t in 2015, respectively. The high value area was mainly distributed in Hainan Island's central mountainous area, and the low value area was mainly distributed in the lower-elevation coastal area. (3) In the past 35 years, urban expansion has been the leading factor in the reduction of Hainan Island's ecosystem service capacity. However, its central nature reserve and other forms of ecological protection have improved its ecosystem service capacity, which has alleviated the overall declining trend of its amount of ecosystem service functions. (4) The driving forces for the spatial distribution of Hainan Island's ecosystem services were analysed using a random forest algorithm, which indicated that its spatial distribution was mainly driven by rainfall, soil moisture, actual evapotranspiration, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature. This study is expected to help planners develop effective environmental policies to accommodate the potential ecological risks associated with urban expansion during the construction of Hainan Island's future free trade port while filling the gaps in existing studies.

AB  - The Colombian Amazon region is part of the Neotropical rainforest (humid forest biome) covering an area of 483,163 km(2) and includes tributaries of both the Amazon and Orinoco River basins. The aquatic ecosystems found there include: rivers and alluvial plains originating in Andean headwaters, on eroded soils of tropical forests in the lowlands, and Guiana Shield formations, comprising a dense fluvial drainage network in the lowlands, with Paleogene/Neogene geological formations (terra firme streams in higher places that don't usually flood) and Paleozoic (shield streams); and Andean and Guiana Shield streams above 200-250 m a.s.l. We present here an exhaustive compilation of published information, supported by fish collections, consisting of a list of 1104 species distributed in 375 genera, 53 families, and 16 orders. We include occurrence data of these species in each sub-basin. The presence/absence species matrix was analyzed using a dendrogram and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis to identify patterns of similarity between basins and sub-basins. We evaluated species composition between basins and among the different geological origins using PERMANOVA. The dendrogram shows co-occurrences of 404 species in the two basins. It also shows two clear groupings of the sub-basins of the Amazon (except Guainia-Negro drainages) and those of the Orinoco. Within the Amazon Basin, there are two nodes according to the geological origin: systems of Andean origin and those of the lowlands. The dendrogram results are consistent with the NMDS analysis, which shows a clear grouping according to the connectivity of the basins; the Guainia-Negro is included in the Amazon basin. Species distribution patterns were supported by the PERMANOVA, and differed significantly between basins (F = 4.3, R = 0.26, P = 0.003) and geological origin (F = 3.6, R = 0.23, P = 0.003). The number of species in this study represents almost a fifth of the ichthyofauna of the Neotropics and about a third of that of the Amazon River basin; clearly supporting Colombia's status among the countries with the greatest diversity of freshwater fish species of the planet. We include here a significant number of new records (75 spp), provide a first approximation of the distribution patterns, and a framework for future biogeographical studies.

AB  - The moist temperate forests extend along the whole length of outer ranges of Himalaya between the subtropical pine forests and sub-alpine timberline formation with a rainfall from 400 mm to 800 mm. The altitudinal range is from 1500 m to 3000 m. The floristic variation in these Himalayan forests is poorly understood especially in the study area. Species composition may be either unpredictable or it may correspond to environmental heterogeneity. Vegetation from 144 stands in between 2000 - 2700 m altitude was sampled. Soil samples were collected to document edaphic conditions. Soils were physically and chemically analyzed. Ordination (DECORANA) and classificatory techniques were used to analyze the vegetation data. No clear disjunct vegetation patterns emerged from these analyses. The major axes brought out by the ordination were related to altitude and although it is possible to relate the units of classification to broad soil types. Soil chemical properties, litter cover and rockiness were significantly associated with the vegetation variation along an altitudinal gradient. The application of classification to the ordination allowed the interpretations of the vegetation variation in terms of topography and predictable climatic factors such as rainfall, wind speed and extent of snow accumulation. The vegetation patterns revealed have been discussed in relation to the general problem of plant community definition in continuous forest type. Our results demonstrate the overlapping rather than clearly discrete boundaries between the vegetation types and species distributions. This overlapping nature of the vegetation types are discussed in terms of overlapping environmental preferences of the species. Our results are consistent with notion that species separate edaphically and landscape scale within the uniform looking forest. This view maintains that differences in soil within the forest are distinct enough to favor different species, and thus create numerous floristically differentiated forest patches along the altitudinal gradients. The findings that non obvious but distinct floristic and edaphic variation exist within the Himalayan moist temperate forests at the landscape scale have important practical implications for forest management. In biodiversity conservation a high degree of habitat heterogeneity implies an increased need for wide-scale information on species distribution and endemism patterns to better assess where the different habitats are, which species they harbor, and where conservation efforts should be concentrated. The overlapping nature of vegetation types and hazy boundaries of the plant communities implies that plant ecologists must continue to attempt the difficult definition of hazy boundaries.

AB  - An understanding of the existing patterns of soil spatial heterogeneity is needed to clarify the potential of car-rying livestock in different grassland regions, so as to provide an important reference and data support for the calculation of stock capacity and the establishment of reasonable grazing prohibition areas and times. Under the same vegetation coverage state, soils with different resilience capabilities will show different livestock carrying capacity. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the effect of soil organic matter as an indicator of soil resilience capabilities on the zoning results of livestock carrying potential, and to discuss the vegetation changes in different potential zoning over the years. By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, the weights of different indicators influencing livestock carrying potential were calculated. The results of this study show that, except for the unique effects of drought, vegetation coverage improved from 2000 to 2017 and that the most significant improvements were observed in Fengning and Guyuan Counties after grazing prohibition. The degraded area in Weichang County, which had good basic vegetation coverage, was the largest in the past many years, accounting for 5.3% of the local area. However, the vegetation coverage affected by the natural envi-ronment in Kangbao County has remained basically unchanged for many years. Soil organic matter participates in the zoning, which reflects the spatial variability in the livestock carrying potential. The calculation results of this work show that the study area can be divided into three levels of carrying potential (high, medium and low) and conservation area. Among the various regions, the high-potential area of Fengning County accounts for the largest proportion, followed by Weichang County, with proportions of 14.1% and 13.6%, respectively. Consid-ering the proportions of high-and moderate-potential areas, the livestock carrying potential of the six counties decreased in the following order: Weichang, Fengning, Guyuan, Zhangbei, Shangyi and Kangbao. According to the multi-year changes in vegetation and the characteristics of the degraded spatial distribution in various re-gions, the high-potential areas should be normal grazing to increase grassland biodiversity, while the medium -potential areas and low-potential areas can be grazed by restricting the number of livestock and sporadically, respectively, to enhance grassland utilization.

AB  - Hydrologic shifts due to climate change will affect the cycling of carbon (C) stored in boreal peatlands. Carbon cycling in these systems is carried out by microorganisms and plants in close association. This study investigated the effects of experimentally manipulated water tables (lowered and raised) and plant functional groups on the peat and root microbiomes in a boreal rich fen. All samples were sequenced and processed for bacterial, archaeal (16S DNA genes; V4), and fungal (internal transcribed spacer 2 [ITS2]) DNA. Depth had a strong effect on microbial and fungal communities across all water table treatments. Bacterial and archaeal communities were most sensitive to the water table treatments, particularly at the 10- to 20-cm depth; this area coincides with the rhizosphere or rooting zone. Iron cyclers, particularly members of the family Geobacteraceae, were enriched around the roots of sedges, horsetails, and grasses. The fungal community was affected largely by plant functional group, especially cinquefoils. Fungal endophytes (particularly Acephala spp.) were enriched in sedge and grass roots, which may have underappreciated implications for organic matter breakdown and cycling. Fungal lignocellulose degraders were enriched in the lowered water table treatment. Our results were indicative of two main methanogen communities, a rooting zone community dominated by the archaeal family Methanobacteriaceae and a deep peat community dominated by the family Methanomicrobiaceae.
   IMPORTANCE This study demonstrated that roots and the rooting zone in boreal fens support organisms likely capable of methanogenesis, iron cycling, and fungal endophytic association and are directly or indirectly affecting carbon cycling in these ecosystems. These taxa, which react to changes in the water table and associate with roots and, particularly, graminoids, may gain greater biogeochemical influence, as projected higher precipitation rates could lead to an increased abundance of sedges and grasses in boreal fens.

AB  - Information about the seasonal changes in soil enzyme activity along altitudinal gradients is key for understanding the responses of soil biochemical processes to ongoing climate change. Therefore, a 3-year in situ soil core incubation experiment was conducted along a 2431-m altitudinal gradient in an alpine-gorge region on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which includes dry valley shrubland, valley-mountain ecotone forest, subalpine coniferous forest, alpine coniferous forest and alpine meadow. The invertase, urease, and acid phosphatase activities in the soil organic layer (OL) and mineral layer (ML) were measured at five critical periods from 2013 to 2017. Higher soil enzyme activity was observed in the subalpine coniferous forest and alpine meadow, whereas lower activity was observed in the dry valley shrubland and valley-mountain ecotone forest. Overall, the seasonal sensitivity of soil enzyme activity decreased with increases in altitude. In the subalpine and alpine coniferous forests, the seasonal sensitivity of soil enzyme activity was significantly higher in the ML than in the OL. The key drivers of the seasonal variation in soil enzyme activity exhibited marked variation with changes in altitude, and these variations depended on the enzyme type and soil layer. Significant effects of temperature and precipitation on seasonal fluctuations in enzyme activities were observed at lower altitudes, whereas soil freeze-thaw cycles significantly affected the seasonal changes in acid phosphatase activity at higher altitudes. In addition, the seasonal variations in specific enzyme activities differed from those found for enzyme activities, which indicated that microorganisms might have mediated the effects of environmental factors on soil enzyme activity by altering the enzyme production efficiency. Briefly, the seasonal fluctuations in soil enzyme activity and their dominant drivers varied greatly among different altitudes in the alpine-gorge region, implying that soil biochemical processes will exhibit differential responses to ongoing climate change at different altitudes.

AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) mineralization is regulated by the input of exogenous organic carbon (C, ExoC) substrate via changing C availability. Although ExoC input occurs widely among global terrestrial ecosystems, it is still not clear how ExoC input affects soil gross N mineralization (GNM). Here, 265 observations from 63 peer-reviewed publications were collected for a global meta-analysis to investigate the effect and the drivers of ExoC input upon soil GNM. The results showed that ExoC input significantly increased GNM by 40.8%, and the influence depended on the types of ExoC substrate. The input of complex ExoC substrate (straw, animal manure, cellulose, etc.) increased soil GNM by 44.8%, while simple ExoC substrate (glucose, amino acids, oxalic, etc.) had no significant effect on GNM. Only in cropland the ExoC input promote the rate of soil GNM, with no significant effect found in either forest or grassland. Furthermore, the results revealed that the application rate of ExoC was the paramount factor affecting soil GNM, given their significant positive correlations. This study also emphasized that initial soil pH (i.e. soil pH before ExoC input) and pH of ExoC, rather than the change of bulk soil pH, played an important role in regulating soil GNM after the ExoC input, and both were significantly negatively correlated with GNM. In addition, soil GNM was also negatively correlated with mean annual temperature but positively related with soil total N and mean annual precipitation. The findings of this meta-analysis contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how soil N availability and cycling respond to ExoC input on a global scale. That means the factors related to rate of ExoC, soil total N, initial soil pH, the pH of ExoC, and climate factors and the interaction among above factors may affect global soil N supplying potential.

AB  - Leaf-cutter ants belonging to the genus Atta are important ecosystem engineers and conspicuous bioturbators in Neotropical regions acting as superorganisms. The Atta ants excavate impressive and long-lived nests with complex subterranean systems that provide shelter from predation and climatic extremes and allow reproduction and fungus-growing. Despite their importance and the large body of literature on the ecology of Atta ants, their role in geological processes is still poorly studied and underestimated compared to other soil invertebrates such as termites and earthworms. In this work, based on interdisciplinary literature and examples from South America, we provide a systematic review of the main mechanisms and processes by which the leaf-cutter ants direct and indirectly affect the soil characteristics and properties, and also their impact on surficial geological and geomorphological processes at different scales. We also highlight how specific digging and transport processes, such as biomixing, biosorting, biotransfer, and biodeposition affect pedogenesis and landform development. We highlight how the soil turnover and mounding processes create different surficial landforms that are easily eroded and reworked along the slopes by runoff. In the subsurface, the digging behavior results in soil sorting and biogenic microaggregates development that increase soil porosity, with implications for waterholding capacity. The subterranean system creates preferential flux pathways that increase the leaching processes and the complexity of weathering fronts in Atta-bioturbated soils. The impact of the bioturbation of leafcutting ants can reach >5 m deep, composed mainly of biofabrics, such as biopores with loose or dense infillings, clay linings, mamillated vugs, excrements, oval granular and rounded microaggregates with biotic origin at great depths (> 2 m). These impacts indicate long-term bioturbation by ants that can result in different soil development pathways. Long-term Atta bioturbation can result in soil homogenization (proisotropic soil development) or create textural contrasts between the soil horizons associated with stone-layers (proanisotropic soil development) through fine material transport from the subsurface. Besides the physical modifications, the Atta nests are biogeochemical hot spots or 'islands of fertility' that increase the habitat quality and growth and affect vegetation patterns through changes in the biotic and abiotic components of soils via nutrient concentrations. The Atta nests affect chemical weathering patterns due to presence of fungal and waste chambers that change the soil pH and CO2 concentration. The impact of leaf-cutting ants in landscape development is an expression of the long-term bioturbation activities and their cumulative impacts (multiple generations) on earth surface processes.

AB  - This study addressed two hypotheses regarding the relationship between stream temperature response to shade removal and streamflow: (a) that temperature response increases as flow declines and (b) that the relationship can be complicated by shifts in dominant streamflow sources and pathways during low-flow periods. The study was based on a paired-catchment design in rain-dominated headwater catchments in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada, and focused on the effect of a 50% thinning treatment on daily maximum temperature in June, July and August for three sites within the harvest treatment. At the two upstream sites, the treatment response exhibited a negative relationship with daily mean streamflow, especially for days with high incident solar radiation. This result suggests that the effectiveness of forest practice rules for protecting cold-water habitat may be reduced under future climatic conditions characterized by more frequent extended drought. However, stream temperature response at the most downstream site exhibited a pronounced inverted-U-shaped relationship with streamflow measured at a weir. It is hypothesized that the response at the most downstream temperature logger was controlled by the existence of a stable, relatively cool inflow just upstream of the logger, which represented an increasing fraction of flow as streamflow generated higher up in the catchment declined through time. There was a lack of convergent surface topography upstream of the logger, and it is hypothesized that localized inflow may have been controlled by the topography of the soil-till interface and/or originated as hyporheic discharge.
   Stream temperature response to forest thinning exhibited a negative relationship with daily mean streamflow at two sites, especially for days with high incident solar radiation, while a third site had an invertedU-shaped relationship. It is hypothesized that the inverted-U-shaped response was controlled by the existence of a stable, relatively cool inflow just upstream of the logger, which represented an increasing fraction of flow as streamflow generated higher up in the catchment declined.image

AB  - The influence of animal pollination on the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., Fabaceae) production is quite variable, but there is a tendency towards the predominance of strong self-fertility. Few studies tested for the influence of pollination on quality aspects of production and seed germination. In view of the global economic importance of the common bean, and the pollinator crisis that the planet is experiencing, the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of animal pollination in the amount and quality of fruits, seeds, and seed germination of the common bean, using four plantations of the 'mulatinho' variety in a region under semiarid climate of NE Brazil as a model. Our hypotheses are: 1) Flowers are visited mainly by bees; 2) The production of fruits, seeds and seed germination are favored by pollinators. Data were collected during the 2017 and 2018 plantings, when data on floral visitors were collected. Controlled crosses (spontaneous self-, cross-and natural pollinations) were performed and the number and morphometry of fruits, number, morphometry, and germi-nation of seeds were compared between the experiments. Reproductive efficiency (RE) and pollen limitation index (PLI) were calculated. Number of formed fruits, measurements, weight, and germination resulting from spontaneous self-pollination showed higher values than those formed by natural and cross-pollination. In 2017, the RE was high (1.44) and the ILP was 0.14, indicating no pollen limitation. In 2018, RE was also high (1.8), but the ILP was 0.3, indicating pollen limitation. Overall, the frequency of visits on focal individuals was low. Conversely to what was expected, butterflies and moths were the most frequent floral visitors, although the flowers were also visited by bees, ants, flies beetles and spiders. None were considered pollinators because they did not touch the reproductive structures of the flower. The bee Xylocopa sp. was the only species capable of pollinating the flowers, as its size allows it to expose the reproductive parts present inside the keel when it lands on the flower to collect the floral resource. However, its frequency was very low, and it did not visit the focal plants. Apparently, low temperatures and high rainfall negatively interfered with pollination and, consequently, with the production. The common bean can be considered a relevant crop in the face of the current global pollinator crisis, as it does not depend on pollinators to produce food, the flowers are used by several pollinator groups and, additionally, it contributes to soil nitrogenating, reducing input costs for farmers.

AB  - A new Oligochaete worm genus with a single species is described from tropical rain forests of Southern Mexico. Lacandodrilus paludosus Fragoso & Rojas gen. et sp. nov., found in sandy and acid poor swampy soils, presented a characteristic morphology of semiaquatic oligochaetes. The new taxon is holandric, with male pores and ovaries in segment 13, with genital prostatic-like lobular glands in segments 13 and 14 and with long seminal vesicles contained within ovisacs. It is also characterized by exonephric holonephridia covered by a peritoneal granular layer, septal glands and long vascular commissures in former segments. It presents a pair of spermathecae without diverticula in segment 10 and it lacks gizzards, typhlosole or esophagus glands. The new taxon is tentatively placed in family Alluroididae, waiting for additional histological studies that will clarify some characters.

AB  - The course of the bark beetle-vectored fungus, Leptographium terebrantis S. J. Barras and T. J. Perry, in stemwood growth loss of declining pines in the southeastern United States was assessed in a 13-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation near Eufaula, Alabama, U.S.A. Using stem inoculation as a surrogate for root infection, we hypothesized that L. terebrantis infection impairs sapwood function and thus limits the tree leaf area (A(L)), new root production, and stemwood growth. Sterile toothpicks colonized by L. terebrantis at varying inoculum densities was used to elicit host growth responses. In the third year after inoculation, the root pathogen reduced the foliage moisture content, whole-tree leaf area (A(L)), the ratio of A(L) to tree sapwood area (A(S)), and stemwood growth in trees receiving the high inoculation treatment relative to those receiving the low or medium inoculation treatments, or the wound or control treatments after seven months of water deficit. The absence of a similar response to water deficit among trees that were noninoculated, wounded, or inoculated at the low or medium densities suggests that, in the loblolly pine-L. terebrantis pathosystem at our study site, the physiological stress caused by water deficit and the high inoculum density was required for the pathogen to elicit a stemwood growth loss. Thus, in loblolly pine forests of the southeastern United States, where climate and soil conditions yield prolonged periods of physiological stress, the presence of L. terebrantis has the potential to reduce stand volume and widen the gap between the predicted and actual stemwood production.

AB  - Ips typographus, which was first identified in 1984 in the oriental spruce forests of Artvin, Turkey, has killed millions of cubic metres of trees. Severe outbreaks of I. typographus following storms resulting in fallen trees and salvage logging done as a part of control activities have caused gaps in the stand canopy of oriental spruce forests. These forests, which have many important functions, such as supplying water, soil conservation and preventing natural disasters in the area they spread, have a fragmented structure because of beetle damages and various traditional utilization practices of the local community. In this study, the local spread of I. typographus in the forests of Hatila Valley National Park and the neighbouring Taslica Forest Sub-District was evaluated, and the areas susceptible to the beetle were determined using the frequency ratio method. A total of 120 pheromone traps were employed in the study. A beetle density map of the study area was produced using the inverse distance weighting interpolation method based on the total number of beetles caught by the traps. Then, the correlation between the regions with high I. typographus density and environmental factors that contributed to this situation were determined using the frequency ratio method. An average 6528.70 beetles were caught by the pheromone traps as a result of this study. The density of the beetles was high in 60.64% of the study area, and an average 10,844.25 beetles were caught by the pheromone traps in these areas. The difference in the total number of beetles between areas with high beetle density and those with low or medium beetle density was significant. It was determined that 32.53% of the study area had very high or high susceptibility to I. typographus. Different parameters such as altitude, slope, aspect, distance to forest roads, stand type, topographic wetness index and area solar radiation were found to be associated with the susceptibility of an area to I. typographus.

AB  - Understanding humipedon dynamics is crucial to capture forest ecological processes. However, studies disentangling humipedon dynamics in tropical forests are scarce. The humipedon structure classification is important because it shows how forest ecosystems interact and react with (a)biotic factors. Here, we used the humus morpho-functional approach to investigate how soil texture and reduced impact-logging affect forest humipedon structure and dynamics in the eastern Amazon. We used a morpho-functional classification of humus forms as the foundation to visualize, classify, and code 133 soil profiles in two contrasting soil textures and different postlogging practices, to identify litter leaching, fragmentation, and humification processes coupled with soil aggregation and root dynamics. The classification of humus forms resulted in the identification of three humus systems: Mull, Moder and Amphi. Sandy and clayey textures differ statistically (chi 2 = 51.83; p < 0.001), with sandy texture predominating in Moder system, while clayey texture exhibits Amphi or Mull systems. Sandy textures presented a weak soil aggregation, but strong association with root (rhiOF) and humification (OH) horizons, leading to a clear transition between organic and mineral pools. In contrast, clayey textures show a strong carbon storage and soil aggregation. The humipedon horizons differ significantly (p = 0.009; stress = 0.1142 and R2 = 0.987) and their dynamics clearly evolve towards an opposite direction. The classification framework introduced here supports environmental management by promoting speed and viability in diagnosing forest ecosystem soils towards forest protection or use in the landscape, and specific climate mitigation goals both in local and regional planning.

AB  - The state Himachal Pradesh in Western Himalaya was explored to know the community structure of earthworms in agroecosystems along the elevation gradient ranges from 300 to 2500 m above sea level. The study aimed to determine the influence of climate, soil variables and the cropping pattern on species diversity and abundance. Therefore, a total of six land-use types including three crop land, and three orchards (Apple, Pear and Mango) were studied at low (300-500 m), middle (500-1500 m) and high (1500-2500 m) elevations. The results indicate that the earthworm community varies with the cropping intensity, with a greater species richness observed in the traditional cropping system including organic input vegetable field than in the cereal crop field having a high input of chemical fertilizers and using more up-to-date heavy and deep ploughing machines. The number of species significantly increased with the increasing elevation, reaching a peak at the middle but decreasing with the further elevation. The Metric-multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis showed the highest similarity of 61% between sites of high elevation, 49% between the sites of low elevation, and 21% similarity between sites of middle and high elevations based on the density of earthworm. The Canonical correspondence analysis showed the significant positive (rainfall, soil moisture, and organic carbon) and negative (pH) relationship with earthworm density. It supports the role of physicochemical parameters in determining the earthworm community along the elevations. Except mango orchard, all sites were predominated by exotic peregrine earthworm species, which is a matter of concern for invasion and impact on the native species. While it is true that anthropogenically influenced ecosystems are more prone to invasion by alien species, further research is required in the adjacent forests to compare the impact of land-use changes on earthworm communities.

AB  - The variation in altitude drives the richness and density of species in tropical ecosystems. The diversity and richness of termites are influenced by the variations in temperature, humidity, and soil properties according to altitude elevation. This is well known for rainy forests and little information is found for semiarid areas of Brazil. In this study, we aimed to identify species richness and encounters density of termites in a hill inserted in the Caatinga Brazilian forest. We found variation in the composition of species as a function of altitude (in a comparison of top and foot of the hill) and in periods of the wet and dry, with an increase in the season wet. The increase the diversity in this period and altitude elevations can be explained by the increases in humidity after rainfalls and maintenance of temperature enabled by the conditions in the hill's top. Our findings provide valuable information regarding termite diversity in semiarid areas as a function of elevation and contribute to other studies that are expanding our understanding of how elevation can affect these organisms.

AB  - Regional biogeographical patterns result from a complex combination across habitat, climate and environmental variables. Biotic and abiotic variables strongly influence the diversity and spatial distribution patterns. However, very few studies analyse the close interaction and effect of environmental variables on diversity at fine spatiotemporal scales. In this study, we evaluated the influence of soil type, vegetation cover and temperature on species diversity and functional structure of dung beetle assemblages. Dung beetle species were sampled using pitfall traps baited with cattle dung from sandy and clay soils in open woodland and closed canopy areas in Mkhuze Game Reserve, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We performed a PERMANOVA, a PERMDISP and an NMDS to analyse differences in species composition between soil and vegetation cover types. To test the effect of environmental variables on species richness and abundance, we performed a generalised least squares model. Lastly, we searched for nodes using a bipartite analysis to evaluate network's potential modularity. We collected 1439 specimens comprising 27 species and 13 genera. Species composition differed between environmental variables. Soil type was the most important driver for changes in dung beetle species composition. Species richness and abundance were influenced by the interaction between soil type and vegetation cover. The combination of microenvironmental preferences potentially influenced the dung beetle assemblage diversity and functional structure. Combining all these preferences may act as a dilution mechanism of interspecific competition in saturated habitat conditions, reducing the number of species that potentially interact and generating a modular network structure of the assemblage.

AB  - Climate change and associated disturbances are expected to exacerbate forest root diseases because of altered distributions of existing and emerging forest pathogens and predisposition of trees due to climatic maladaptation and other disturbances. Predictions of suitable climate space (potential geographic distribution) for forest pathogens and host trees under contemporary and future climate scenarios will guide the selection of appropriate management practices by forest managers to minimize adverse impacts of forest disease within forest ecosystems. A native pathogen (Armillaria solidipes) that causes Armillaria root disease of conifers in North America is used to demonstrate bioclimatic models (maps) that predict suitable climate space for both pathogen and a primary host (Pseudotsuga menziesii, Douglas-fir) under contemporary and future climate scenarios. Armillaria root disease caused by A. solidipes is a primary cause of lost productivity and reduced carbon sequestration in coniferous forests of North America, and its impact is expected to increase under climate change due to tree maladaptation. Contemporary prediction models of suitable climate space were produced using Maximum Entropy algorithms that integrate climatic data with 382 georeferenced occurrence locations for DNA sequence-confirmed A. solidipes. A similar approach was used for visually identified P. menziesii from 11,826 georeferenced locations to predict its climatic requirements. From the contemporary models, data were extrapolated through future climate scenarios to forecast changes in geographic areas where native A. solidipes and P. menziesii will be climatically adapted. Armillaria root disease is expected to increase in geographic areas where predictions suggest A. solidipes is well adapted and P. menziesii is maladapted within its current range. By predicting areas at risk for Armillaria root disease, forest managers can deploy suitable strategies to reduce damage from the disease.

AB  - Soil quality refers to the assessment of the chemical, physical and biological properties of the soil and has been a subject explored within the lines of agronomic research because of anthropic actions that often cause degradation. The objective was to research, among the studied physical and biological attributes, those that best explain, linearly and spatially, the variability of the soil cultivated with soybeans in the rainy season and fallow in the dry season in the agrosilvopastoral system. The work was carried out in the 2015/2016 agricultural year, in Ipameri, Goias. The spatial distributions and correlations between some soil quality indicator attributes were analyzed: microbial biomass carbon (CBM), soil microbial respiration (C-CO2), metabolic quotient (qCO(2)) and soil moisture (UG), at a depth of 0.00-0.10 m, during periods of rain and drought. A geostatistical grid was installed, where 52 points were collected. Descriptive analysis of the data was carried out to obtain linear, simple and multiple correlations between the attributes. The semivariograms were modeled to obtain the respective krigings and cross-validations. The co-krigages of interest were established. The microbiological attributes of the soil were good indicators of specific management zones, showing greater spatial dependence in the rainy season. qCO(2) was directly related to C-CO2 in the rainy season, while CBM was inversely proportional in bothrainy and dry periods. The qCO(2) was the attribute that best represented, linearly and spatially, the variability of the soil under the ILPF system, reflecting the zones of greatest efficiency in the use of the substrate by soil organisms.

AB  - Seven new species of the giant pill-millipede genus Zoosphaerium Pocock, 1895 are described from Madagascar: Z. nigrum sp. nov., Z. silens sp. nov., Z. ambatovaky sp. nov., Z. beanka sp. nov., Z. voahangy sp. nov., Z. masoala sp. nov. and Z. spinopiligerum sp. nov. All species are described based on drawings and scanning electron microscopy, while genetic barcoding of the COI gene was successful for six of the seven new species. Additional COI barcode information is provided for the first time for Z. album Wesener, 2009 and Z. libidinosum (de Saussure & Zehntner, 1897). Zoosphaerium nigrum sp. nov. and Z. silens sp. nov. belong to the Z. libidinosum species-group, Z. ambatovaky sp. nov. to the Z. coquerelianum species-group, Z. beanka sp. nov., Z. voahangy sp. nov. and Z. masoala sp. nov. to the Z. platylabum species-group and Z. spinopiligerum sp. nov. to the Z. piligerum species-group. Updated identification keys are provided for each species-group. Two western dry forest species, Z. silens sp. nov. and Z. voahangy sp. nov. are recorded from two localities, while the other five species are currently only known from their type localities. Of special conservation concern might be Z. ambatovaky sp. nov. from the lowland rainforest fragment of Ambatovaky, a nowadays isolated lowland rainforest, rapidly shrinking due to slash and burn agriculture. In addition to the new species, new locality data is provided for 11 species and numerous unidentifiable species of Zoosphaerium: Z. neptunus (Butler, 1872), Z. platylabum (de Saussure & Zehntner, 1902) and Z. piligerum (de Saussure & Zehntner, 1897) from the central eastern montane forests, as well as Z. ambrense Wesener, 2009, Z. aureum Wesener, 2009, Z. libidinosum, Z. corystoides Wesener, 2009, Z. discolor Wesener, 2009, Z. smaragdinum Wesener, 2009, Z. villosum Wesener & Sierwald, 2005 and Microsphaerotherium anjozorobe Wesener, 2009.
